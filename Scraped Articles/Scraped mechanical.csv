At what stage of jewelary manufacturing is 3d printing used?,https://medium.com/@vexmatech/at-what-stage-of-jewelary-manufacturing-is-3d-printing-used-fa803d1f4697?source=tag_archive---------2-----------------------,"3D Printing,Jewelary,Technology,Engineering,Mechanical","This is an excellent question. The answer to this is going to be pretty long. So kindly bear with me.The thing you have to know about conventional jewelry manufacturing is most often, the jewelry is made by using a process called investment casting or lost-wax casting. Recommend reading this article for a background: Investment hd casting 1Once you have read that, I am sure you would have understood that there are several properties you need from the pattern you will make a mold from. Ideally you would want a material with the following qualities :You need to have a good surface finish of the jewelry so that it shines better and is aesthetically more pleasing. Therefore it is of paramount importance that your pattern has a good surface finish. You need to use a substance which burns off quickly without much residue. It is durable in variable conditions of temperature. You don’t want your pattern to be made of a material which distorts easily. Should be easy to transport.The material which most often meets these requirements is wax. Although, it sometimes has issues on the 3rd parameter.The usual manufacturing process (I am not sure if the OP knows how the jewelry manufacturing process works, but for the ones who might now know, here is how it goes. Bold indicates the stage in the manufacturing process):3d printing prototyping service tamilnadu, andhra pradesh, gujarat, maharashtra, telengana, madhya pradesh — sla technology.Design of the part in a CAD/CAM software.Prototyping by use of a CNC machine to cut a block of wax in the shape desired from the CAD file.Urethane casting [Optional only if multiple copies are needed] : Making urethane molds to make multiple wax model copies.Casting: Setting up of a “Christmas tree” where these models are attached to a runner and then dipped in a ceramic slurry.Pouring of the liquid metal into the runner. The metal burns and evaporates the wax and solidifies in the desired shape.Surface Finish: Minor finishing required.Written byvexmatech“One stop shop from product design and development to manufacturing your creativity — 3d printing services”Follow3D PrintingJewelaryTechnologyEngineeringMechanicalMore from vexmatechFollow“One stop shop from product design and development to manufacturing your creativity — 3d printing services”More From MediumHow to Prototype VR Designs Without CodePatricia Reiners in Thinking DesignPart 5: Dynamic Typography Redux: clamp() on itJason Pamental in Web Typography NewsDesign SystemsJules ThiventDeep Brazil: a reality far away from the most central locationsQuesttonóApproaching Everyday Racism through Fiction in Co-Creation WorkshopsHillary CareyHow to Deal with UncertaintyMartin Tomitsch in Design at SydneyHow should a UX designer plan for voice interaction?丹尼爾 Daniel in uxbreakfastSociety Is Unequal by DesignAshley Nicole in An Injustice!AboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

What is raw denim ? Raw denim is denim that has not undergone any of the usual washing and distressing processes (Heddels, 2011). Denim itself is a sturdy cotton twill fabric, typically blue, used for jeans, overalls, and other clothing (Oxford language). Raw denim has a value to those who seek for its vintage, unique, and rare taste of art; especially in some terms such as fades, honeycombs effect, creases, and well-branded arcuate. Technically, denim has some specific characteristic such as weight (stated in oz) which resulted by its layer thickness; size dimension (depends on the brand); material composition (w/o elastane, organic fiber); sewing technique (warp&weft) and lastly the dyeing, with indigo as its well known navy-type colour.Ironheart Denim Fades Example (Heddels)Some says that to optimize the honeycomb areas, denim has to be tighter to make contacts to our back knee so if we actively move, the effects would appear sooner. It is perhaps starts from slim tapered fit to skinny one. Even there is some opinion that to maximize those art of thing, denim should be worn while we sleep to extend its wear time. But it is to us to not forget that the tighter the denim, the more we become uncomfortable. Our blood flows inside the thigh — knee — calf — foot and back, pumped by heart so that it has hydrostatic pressure inside. Therefore, by adding external pressure because of the misfits, the tight denim could hamper the flows and we will possibly feel dizzy, pins and needles and so as to accelerate the flow rate of blood, the heart will be needing extra energy to pump it.If we look from the simplified picture above, we can see the width of calf veins is being reduced by wearing skinny-er fit denim. By Bernoulli equation of energy, as the continuous volume rate flows through smaller cross sectional area, the velocity of blood will be increased; then the energy form of pressure will drop due to the increase of kinetic energy, as the energy of both state kept equivalent. Eventually only the lesser blood carry the oxygen and some other molecules to support the metabolism.Example :Disclaimer : our reference is a guy whose knee circumference ranges between 17–18”Comparing the 18 of straight fit to 15.6 skinny circumference would have us 1.15 on radius ratio also, and the velocity ratio inside the knee wearing the denim will be 1.33 higher than the one wearing straight fit, if we assume the mean velocity of blood streams inside knee = 1 m/s, the difference of both kinetic energy is 175 stated in pascal, while blood pressure on knee is around 150 mmHg or 20000 PaBut, there is also another factor that cause the considerable amount of pressure drop, that is the loss coefficient for both entrance and exit streams through vein, as follows :Loss coefficient for streams flowrateEventually, the extra stress which works as time pass by, will weaken the wall of veins and cause varicose, which lead into more flow losses due to the many complicated swollen per milimetres.Varicose in knee veinsAlso, we need to know how rigid denim is, which may we will allow for the ease of mobility and dynamic enough to do sort of activities.Elasticity properties on denim cottonElasticity properties of regular cotton fiberBy my interpretation, denim is way stronger, or tougher due to the strength in g/tex index because designed for long time use, while elongation is stated to be higher than regular cotton because denim is way less elastic and ductile than regular one, because regular cotton fiber has 74% high of elastic recovery index which means the material wont be lengthen in the time we use in frequent. And the cotton length for both has denim to be higher because material of regular corron fiber is perhaps more “compressible” as we see by time we wear it, it will get thinner rather than denim which is still “solid”.And thing we need to consider is the shrinkage occurs in denim washing/soaking — to not piss the denimhead to minimize indigo dye we vanish, mainly for unsanforized denim (totally no wash process, still hairy and rough). The reduction of size will automatically limit our movement, except the denim has elastane composition (usually 1–2%) or has been worn out in years.So, my advice is : be wise on planning your intention to wear denim and i hope this additive analysis might give you some insight and care guidanceSource :PhysiopediaMuscle spindles — PhysiopediaResearchGateIntra-arterial blood pressure (BPia), knee extensor kicking force …- Fluid Mechanics, Munsonhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/155892501701200103https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Properties-of-cotton-fibre_tbl1_311185443Williamsburg Garment CompanyLife Cycle of Raw Jeans Shrinkage & Stretching | Williamsburg …Written byairlangga ario pamungkasFollowDenimHealthMechanicalDiscussionMore from airlangga ario pamungkasFollowMore From MediumDrug companies will make a killing from CoronavirusUCL Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose in UCL IIPP BlogSoap vs. Hand Sanitizer: How They Work & Which is BestRobert Roy BrittAdvanced Life Support in the StreetsBeau Blackmore in Advanced Life Support in the StreetsUnsafe Food, a Killer in Poor Nations, Needs Government ActionPassBlueIs LASIK Eye Surgery Worth it?

N/A,https://medium.com/@airlangga.ario/raw-denim-in-its-health-issue-observation-based-on-mechanical-analysis-16df093d2060?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Denim,Health,Mechanical,Discussion","Raw Denim, in its Health Issue Observation based on Mechanical AnalysisLately, some people are paying more enthusiasm on Raw Denim. What is raw denim ? Raw denim is denim that has not undergone any of the usual washing and distressing processes (Heddels, 2011). Denim itself is a sturdy cotton twill fabric, typically blue, used for jeans, overalls, and other clothing (Oxford language). Raw denim has a value to those who seek for its vintage, unique, and rare taste of art; especially in some terms such as fades, honeycombs effect, creases, and well-branded arcuate. Technically, denim has some specific characteristic such as weight (stated in oz) which resulted by its layer thickness; size dimension (depends on the brand); material composition (w/o elastane, organic fiber); sewing technique (warp&weft) and lastly the dyeing, with indigo as its well known navy-type colour.Ironheart Denim Fades Example (Heddels)Some says that to optimize the honeycomb areas, denim has to be tighter to make contacts to our back knee so if we actively move, the effects would appear sooner. It is perhaps starts from slim tapered fit to skinny one. Even there is some opinion that to maximize those art of thing, denim should be worn while we sleep to extend its wear time. But it is to us to not forget that the tighter the denim, the more we become uncomfortable. Our blood flows inside the thigh — knee — calf — foot and back, pumped by heart so that it has hydrostatic pressure inside. Therefore, by adding external pressure because of the misfits, the tight denim could hamper the flows and we will possibly feel dizzy, pins and needles and so as to accelerate the flow rate of blood, the heart will be needing extra energy to pump it.If we look from the simplified picture above, we can see the width of calf veins is being reduced by wearing skinny-er fit denim. By Bernoulli equation of energy, as the continuous volume rate flows through smaller cross sectional area, the velocity of blood will be increased; then the energy form of pressure will drop due to the increase of kinetic energy, as the energy of both state kept equivalent. Eventually only the lesser blood carry the oxygen and some other molecules to support the metabolism.Example :Disclaimer : our reference is a guy whose knee circumference ranges between 17–18”Comparing the 18 of straight fit to 15.6 skinny circumference would have us 1.15 on radius ratio also, and the velocity ratio inside the knee wearing the denim will be 1.33 higher than the one wearing straight fit, if we assume the mean velocity of blood streams inside knee = 1 m/s, the difference of both kinetic energy is 175 stated in pascal, while blood pressure on knee is around 150 mmHg or 20000 PaBut, there is also another factor that cause the considerable amount of pressure drop, that is the loss coefficient for both entrance and exit streams through vein, as follows :Loss coefficient for streams flowrateEventually, the extra stress which works as time pass by, will weaken the wall of veins and cause varicose, which lead into more flow losses due to the many complicated swollen per milimetres.Varicose in knee veinsAlso, we need to know how rigid denim is, which may we will allow for the ease of mobility and dynamic enough to do sort of activities.Elasticity properties on denim cottonElasticity properties of regular cotton fiberBy my interpretation, denim is way stronger, or tougher due to the strength in g/tex index because designed for long time use, while elongation is stated to be higher than regular cotton because denim is way less elastic and ductile than regular one, because regular cotton fiber has 74% high of elastic recovery index which means the material wont be lengthen in the time we use in frequent. And the cotton length for both has denim to be higher because material of regular corron fiber is perhaps more “compressible” as we see by time we wear it, it will get thinner rather than denim which is still “solid”.And thing we need to consider is the shrinkage occurs in denim washing/soaking — to not piss the denimhead to minimize indigo dye we vanish, mainly for unsanforized denim (totally no wash process, still hairy and rough). The reduction of size will automatically limit our movement, except the denim has elastane composition (usually 1–2%) or has been worn out in years.So, my advice is : be wise on planning your intention to wear denim and i hope this additive analysis might give you some insight and care guidanceSource :PhysiopediaMuscle spindles — PhysiopediaResearchGateIntra-arterial blood pressure (BPia), knee extensor kicking force …- Fluid Mechanics, Munsonhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/155892501701200103https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Properties-of-cotton-fibre_tbl1_311185443Williamsburg Garment CompanyLife Cycle of Raw Jeans Shrinkage & Stretching | Williamsburg …Written byairlangga ario pamungkasFollowDenimHealthMechanicalDiscussionMore from airlangga ario pamungkasFollowMore From MediumDrug companies will make a killing from CoronavirusUCL Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose in UCL IIPP BlogSoap vs. Hand Sanitizer: How They Work & Which is BestRobert Roy BrittAdvanced Life Support in the StreetsBeau Blackmore in Advanced Life Support in the StreetsUnsafe Food, a Killer in Poor Nations, Needs Government ActionPassBlueIs LASIK Eye Surgery Worth it?

Though an endotracheal tube patient is directly connected to ventilator through which oxygen is supplied to the body. It is also a diagnostic tool used to measure static compliance of airway resistance and irregular functioning of respiratory system. Mechanical ventilator plays a vital role in reducing the amount of energy that patient uses during breathing, and patients body can focus on recovering from infections.Mechanical Ventilators Market: Drivers & RestraintsMarket Driver:Increasing Number of ICU Admission Due to COVID-19Over the past few months the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted increase in number of ICU admission which has resulted in demand for mechanical ventilators. According to World Health Organization (WHO), as of August 2020 the total confirmed cases of COVID-19 are 20.4 million across the globe. Exponential rise in COVID-19 cases has generated need for long and short term respiratory support. Additionally, rising proportion of critical care beds coupled with breathing related emergencies among elderly population will enhance the need for ventilators. Thus, the unpredictable dawn of COVID-19 pandemic has anticipated increasing the demand for mechanical ventilators resulting in growth of market during the forecasted period.Get Sample Copy of This Report @https://www.forencisresearch.com/mechanical-ventilators-market-sample-pdf/Market Restraints:High Cost of Mechanical VentilatorsMechanical ventilators are device that are used to help patient manage breathing by maintaining their oxygen level. As these devices helps to patients to survive in their critical condition, they need to be designed with more accuracy and precision. Thus, manufacturing of the devices requires precision equipment such as expiratory pressure regulator, gas accumulator, inspiratory flow regulator, and other which are costly. Thus, high cost of mechanical ventilators may hinder the growth of market to some extent.Mechanical Ventilators Market: Key SegmentsSegmentation based on product type: Critical Care, Neonatal, Transport & Portable, and Others.Segmentation based on mode: Non-invasive ventilation, and Invasive ventilation.Segmentation based on application: Hospital & Clinical, Home Care, Ambulatory Surgical Center, and Others.Segmentation based on region covers: North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Middle East & Africa and South America with individual country-level analysis.Request for Methodology of This Report @https://www.forencisresearch.com/mechanical-ventilators-market-request-methodology/Mechanical Ventilators Market: Report ScopeThe report on the mechanical ventilators market covers a deep dive analysis of historic, recent and current market trends.
