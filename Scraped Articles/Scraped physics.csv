The Gauss Bonnet Theorem and an Introduction to Spherical Geometry,https://medium.com/cantors-paradise/the-gauss-bonnet-theorem-and-an-introduction-to-spherical-geometry-d3613502fdb4?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Math,Physics,Programming,Science,Education","A visual proof of the Gauss Bonnet Theorem for triangles on spheres!Spherical geometry is a beautiful, and very visual, area of mathematics, with weird properties (such as that the angles of triangles don’t sum to 180 !!!).Understanding a little bit of Spherical GeometryThe Gauss-Bonnet Theorem for triangles on spheres is a special, but rather beautiful, case of the more general Gauss-Bonnet Theorem.The theorem can be understood visuallyFirst, let’s visualise what a triangle on a sphere is. Below are two visualisations of the same triangle.Source: Geogebra. See https://www.geogebra.org/m/sPx39ZfdTo draw a triangle on a sphere, we pick 3 points, and then we draw lines connecting them. But drawing a ‘line’ on a sphere isn’t an obvious concept. So instead we draw a curve between the two points. Visually, its the curve you’d expect to draw if you tried to make the curve as short, or as ‘direct’, as possible.We then consider the angles on the triangle. But this triangle is on a sphere, not on a flat sheet of paper! How do we work out the angle?There is an intuitive answer. As the curves connecting the endpoints of the triangle get closer together, they look more and more ‘straight’. In the picture below, we zoom in really close to illustrate this.Visually, this should give you the sense that we can make sense of the idea of an angle for a triangle on a sphere.Optional extra: defining angles for triangleIf you’re interested in how to define the angles on spheres then a slightly more detailed approach is below. But the intuitive understanding is enough for the rest of the proof, so its not essential to do this section to understand the rest.Below, we take 3 points on a sphere, B, C, D and create a triangle. We then create 3 planes, using the centre of sphere and (C,D), (D,B) or (C,B).Made using GeogebraThe above picture is a bit scary, so the picture below shows how we create a plane using two of the points and the centre.Then we define the angle between two sides using the planes: as planes are ‘flat’ objects, like sheets of paper in 3D space, we can define the angle between two planes.Stating the TheoremFinally we state the Theorem! But, one last thing. We measure angles in radians. That just means that everything is measure compared to ‘2*pi’. We say 2pi radians is the same as 360 degrees. So pi radians is the same as 180 degrees. And pi/2 radians is the same in 90 degrees. This is similar to how you can measure distance in terms of kilometres, but you can also measure distance in terms of miles.However, if you feel much more comfortable using degrees, I will also give the formula using degrees. (I prefer radians because all the results become so much prettier)We label the three angles in the triangle a, b, c. Then we get the following formula for the area of the triangle:Formula using radiansOr, using degrees instead of radiansformula using degreesA surprising consequenceThis formula for the area of the triangle already has some amazing consequences. Using the formula when the angles are measured in degrees, if the sum of the angles was equal to 180 degrees, then the area of the triangle would be 0. This is obviously nonsensical. As the area is greater than zero, we can conclude that the sum of the angles of spherical triangle must be greater than 180 degrees, or (measured in radians), greater than pi radians.ProofFinally, we prove the theorem!First we find the area of a much simpler object. This object we call a ‘(spherical) lune’.source: Dexter’s Notes, Geometry IBWe take two planes, and look at the area of the sphere ‘captured’ between them. The area of an entire sphere is 4pi. So if the angle between them is, say, c radians, then the area captured between it is 4c. For instance, if the angle between our planes was a right angle, that is 90 degrees or pi/2 radians, then the area captured would be 2pi, or half the total area.(However, note that if you use degrees the formula is a bit less elegant. We then have to normalise 90 degrees and adjust by a factor of pi, so the area, when using degrees is given by 4*pi*c/180, and when c=90 we get the area = 4*pi*90/180 = 2pi as before)Ok, so we can find the surface area of a much simple shape. But what about our triangle?Next we use a sneaky trick. We do the same as the above, but three times. When we shade this on the sphere below, we can see that a triangle is in the region which is shaded all three colours (which are merged to form a brownish colour)source: Dexter’s Notes, Geometry IB.What happens when we sum the areas of each part? The triangle appears in all three of the spherical lunes, so its area is counted three times. So, if we sum the area of the lune, we get the total surface area of the sphere plus four times the area of our triangle. That’s because our triangle’s area is ‘double counted’ on each side, and there are two sides. Moreover, we know the area of each lune! That’s because the angle of the lune determines its area, and the angle of each lune in this case is simply the angle between two sides of the triangle.Thus, we can conclude:And we are done!If you have any thoughts or improvements, please leave them in the comments below!

Econophysics -Where Physics meets Economics,https://medium.com/@hrish.relekar/econophysics-where-physics-meets-economics-6263914141e9?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Finance,Economics,Physics,Econophysics,Brownian Motion","Hrishikesh Relekar, Deovrat MehendaleIt was just another day when we (authors) both were talking about the wonders of Black-Scholes formula and its implications in the financial world. Black-Scholes formula was first introduced to us in the course of Mathematical Finance. We were moved by the idea that a concept which was discovered by a botanist named Robert Brown, “A Brownian Motion of Pollen Grains”, is now frequently used by Wall Street traders to earn money. The same thought grew into curiosity, which prompted us to dig more into interconnections of different sciences with the field of Economics. Like most of you reading this article, at first, we were greatly surprised when we found the existence of such a field, commonly known as, Econophysics which uses borrowed ideas from theoretical physics, quantum mechanics, and some other branches of physics in an attempt to explore the undiscovered laws of finance and economics.This article primarily discusses three types of areas where models built by physicists have been used to develop a new perspective to look at economics.Brownian Motion: A concept where physics, biology, and economics come togetherHave you ever seen and wondered about how small particles suspended in a fluid behave and have a kind of a jittery motion?2-Dimensional Brownian MotionThe discovery of Brownian motion is often credited to Scottish botanist Robert Brown. He observed the random movement of pollen grains suspended in water under a microscope. In 1905, almost eighty years later, after Brown, theoretical physicist Albert Einstein published a paper where he modeled the motion of the pollen grains as being moved by individual water molecules, making one of his first major scientific contributions. But a lesser-known fact is that 5 years before Einstein’s miracle year paper, a young French mathematician named Louis Bachelier described a phenomenon very similar to Brownian motion eventually described by Einstein, albeit in the context of asset prices in financial markets. Forgotten for over 50 years, in 1956, Bachelier’s book came into the attention of renowned economist and Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson. He described the scene as,“When I opened it up, it was as if a whole new world was laid out before me.”Random walks performed by gas molecules or asset prices obey the Markov process, where future steps are independent of past history given present. In limiting cases, it can be proved that such a random walk tends to what is commonly known as Brownian motion. To understand the concept, first, we need to understand Brownian motion.Mathematics behind Brownian motion:A random variable is said to follow a Brownian Motion if the following conditions hold:So, in short, each step is independent of previous steps and follows a normal distribution. It is easy to get an intuition of why pollen grains suspended in water undergo a random movement of Brownian motion, but it is hard to digest the fact that stock price movements also follow this type of motion. Here are two arguments usually given by traditional economists to explain why stock prices should follow a Brownian motion -1. If the short-term variations of asset prices are predictable, then the speculators will be able to find and exploit it by buying undervalued assets and by selling overvalued assets. This itself will eliminate the pattern.2. Asset prices reflect all available information. Hence, in an informed market, asset prices are automatically adjusted according to the information available. Because if a stock price does not reflect all the available information, investors can obtain a definite gain from it until that information is no longer useful for trading.The second conjecture is also known as the Efficient Market Hypothesis formulated by Nobel laureate Eugene Fama in his popular paper entitled “Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical Work.” To picturize this, we present two visualizations. The first visualization shows one-dimensional Brownian motion performed by a gas particle and the second visualization shows Brownian motion of stock (initially priced at 50). Notice that, when a gas particle jumps by +ε on x-axis, simultaneously, the stock price jumps by +ε. Hence, in this way, the stock price also follows the same Brownian motion as that of a gas particle. As discussed, each step of particle is drawn from a normal distribution independently from its past history.Stock Price following Brownian MotionTherefore, next time before investing in stock market, remember that, if all investors behave rationally and if markets are fully informed, there won’t remain any such thing as ‘beating the market’.Although Brownian motion by asset prices has been used to derive many mathematical models, including Black-Scholes formula, several economists have also criticized its core assumptions. After all, humans are social animals. Most of our decisions are not characterized by a mathematical definition of rationality. Therefore, such irrational behavior has a significant impact on real markets. Critics of this hypothesis have pointed out that in the short term, if stock prices begin rising, the odds are slightly in favor of it continuing to rise. Market booms and asset bubbles are examples of such irrational exuberance, commonly studied in behavioral finance.Kinetic Exchange Models of Economic CollisionsImagine a closed container consisting of gas particles. If the initial number of particles and the total system energy are both conserved, then the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution is the most probable distribution for energies of particles corresponding to the maximum entropy value. The formula for Boltzmann Gibbs distribution is as follows:Similarly, consider a hypothetical closed economy where energy is analogous to money, and collisions between particles are similar to monetary interactions between agents. Wealth or total money of this closed economy is conserved over a period. So theoretically, the wealth distribution of our closed economy should also obey the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution (Now onwards, we will call it BGD). To test this, we carried out an experiment. We took 1000 economic agents in a closed economy. The initial wealth of these economic agents is drawn from random distribution varying from 0 to 1. Then random binary interactions are proposed, in which the total money or wealth remains constant in each interaction. Thus, for two randomly chosen agents i and j, the economic exchange obeys the following expressions:The model is run for 2×10⁶ iterations, and results are aggregated over 100 realizations. The results can be seen in the figure where histogram represents the number of agents for particular wealth, and the curve is fitted to represent the histogram. And guess what!! The curve follows BGD whereby energy of ith state being wealth and kT is equal to the average wealth of an individual.Simulation Results for Economic Collision ModelLet’s define the Gini index to study wealth inequality in an economy. Gini index is defined as,G, by definition, is between 0 and 1, where 0 corresponds to a perfect equality in wealth distribution. The measure Gini index for the above simulation is 0.5, which is one of the characteristics of BGD. Note that in a perfectly socialist system, the Gini index will be zero reflecting perfect equality. But at the same time, the entropy of such a system is also zero showing it is statistically less likely to achieve such configuration if we allow free transactions. Knowing this, a wise person can certainly see the similarity between the proposed model and free-market economies.The surprising thing to note is that over 100 years ago, Pareto made extensive studies in Europe and found that wealth distribution follows BGD for about 90 to 95% of the population. The upper 5% follow a power tail law. Some economists went ahead and found that the wealth distribution of countries like India, UK, and Brazil also follow BGD for lower class of the population. How fascinating!!Once, while writing about the foundations of statistical mechanics, Boltzmann said that,“Molecules are like so many individuals, having the most various states of motion.”We think he had never imagined what he meant would lead to another field of research years after his death. As per our understanding, the key reason behind the replication of kinetic exchange models in the real world is the definition of maximum entropy. There is no external force that drives the system to maximum entropy, but it is just that such distribution is statistically more likely. Yet, some critics have pointed out two fundamental flaws in these models.First, in the real-world economy, money is not conserved all the time. In fact, central banks like the Reserve Bank of India infuse extra money now and then by lowering interest rates or vice versa by increasing them. Even if the Reserve Bank of India infuses money, initially, it only goes to some major players such as the State of Bank of India or ICICI bank. This causes temporary deviation in Boltzmann Gibbs distribution, but again gradually, our economy starts to converge to the new Boltzmann Gibbs distribution with increased wealth this time. Moreover, if this process is continuous and sufficiently slow, then the economic system will maintain quasi-equilibrium state.The second problem with the model is its definition of wealth. Generally, while calculating a citizen’s wealth, a nation considers the value of his/her assets/properties other than money. Our model is a replication of a simple exchange economy where all economic agents exchange their initial endowments, but in the production economy, wealth is also generated or destroyed with each transaction. In his famous book “Wealth of Nations” Adam Smith quotes,“Nation’s wealth is really the stream of goods and services that it creates.”Consider a two-person economy. Each of them has $20. Now, a person creates a simple hut by using raw woods and leaves and sells to another person for $10. Therefore, in our two-person economy, the first person has $10 in cash and $10 in property, whereas the second person has $30 in cash. If you notice it carefully, money is conserved after transaction but additional wealth is generated due to production of hut.Numerous models have been built to include this definition of wealth, but most of them aren’t reproducible in the real world. We think the best test for empirically validating this model is to measure the distribution of M1 money (total distribution of liquid cash in each country) to validate these models. Nonetheless, if interested, we will highly recommend you to go through list of references used in this paper.Black holes and economic singularitySingularity was originally a mathematical term for a point at which an equation has no solution. In physics, it was proven that a large enough collapsing star would eventually become a black hole. It becomes so dense that its own gravity would cause a singularity in the fabric of spacetime, a point where many standard physics equations suddenly have no solution.Many economists draw a rough parallel between a black hole and our current global economic situation. An economic bubble of any type, but especially a debt bubble, can be thought of as an incipient black hole. When the bubble collapses in upon itself, it creates its own black hole with an event horizon beyond which all traditional economic modeling breaks down. It is what Rogoff and Reinhart call the “Bang!” moment, when a country loses the confidence of the bond market.With the loss of confidence, there is a rise of a period of uncertainty, causing massive miscoordination between the plans of millions of economic actors. Amid a recession, workers tend to possess skills that entrepreneurs do not want to employ. Entrepreneurs have projects that investors do not wish to fund. Firms have products that individuals do not buy, and households have savings that firms do not borrow. It is this period when the most fundamental law of economics, an invisible hand, fails to coordinate economic plans of economic agents.Although the black hole math does not fit the above scenario exactly, in our opinion, it is sometimes beneficial to have a new perspective in order to develop innovative solutions. The inter-linkage of black holes with debt bubbles is one of the examples of such comparisons.Concluding RemarksEvery time history has taught us that if you want different results, you have to try different approaches. Max Planck once said,“When you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change.”Econophysics has remarkably provided us with a novel and innovative way of looking at conventional economics. Like any other model, models developed in Econophysics are not perfect, but they have helped us push the boundaries of our imagination. No wonder, the first Nobel Prize winner in economics, Jan Tinbergen, was a physicist by training. Problems are nothing but wake-up calls for creativity, and we believe that this creativity driven by passion of discovery will continue to surprise us with its miracles.References[1] K. Sharma and A.

The Universe In Between the Lines of a Glass of Wine,https://medium.com/predict/the-universe-in-between-the-lines-of-a-glass-of-wine-9b1bde910bd4?source=tag_archive---------2-----------------------,"Science,Philosophy,Universe,Physics,Quotes","Photo by George Cox on UnsplashThis post was inspired by Richard Feynman and the last part of his lecture: The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences, in which he speaks about how everything in science is connected and physics being the most fundamental of all.A poet once said, “The whole universe is in a glass of wine.” We will probably never know in what sense he meant that, for poets do not write to be understood. But it is true that if we look at a glass of wine closely enough we see the entire universe.The Universe does not divide science into parts. It’s what we do to make life easier, so we don’t have to deal with every detail of particle interaction, but instead, we can make use of emergent laws in chemistry, geology, biology, psychology, and so on.What do you see in this picture?Image by the author.Let me tell you what I see.First, I see a cat, trying to escape the boundaries I have set for him. He wants to run free on the grass below, which unfortunately is two floors down. Suicidal cat? Probably not, although we like to joke about it. Please don’t jump, kitty.I see the sun shining, almost through its butt. The sunrays sines through the thinner outer layer of his hair, makes the butt fur look like on fire. Some of the sunrays get stopped by the solid cat body because he’s opaque, meaning he absorbs all of the visible light. The electromagnetic wave, which is the nature of light, does not have enough energy to penetrate through the cat. What if the Sun was radiating more energetic x-rays instead? In some binary stars, where matter falls from one star into a massive neutron star or a black hole, while they do their violent dance, that’s the case. We know x-ray from the skeleton images, so that would be what the cat would look to us if out Sun was a binary x-ray star.There is an artist impression of a nebula lying randomly by my glass of wine, in the form of a kindle cover. The only reason why I see the colors on the cover is that the sunlight gets reflected in different wavelengths because of the chemicals that the cover is painted with. Some chemicals absorb red and green and only the blue is reflected, while others absorb green and reflect the blue and red, which our brain mix into purple.I see a glass of wine and the sunrays reflecting. The crystal glass refracts the sunlight, it distorts it, making the image behind it distorted. Making the cat's tail broken. Glas has a refraction number of about 1.5 compared to air, so the sunrays bend. And what is our vision, but an image created in our head, from the information of photons reaching our detector eyes and then being interpreted in our brain? So the resulting vision gets distorted.Who said that physics is not about art? The Universe paints Picasso style and sometimes a little bit of Dali.The glass itself is shaped, it bends and curls and the light gathers in some spots, making it shine locally. Like small communities or cities on Earth as seen from the sky. If we zoom in, will we see small communities of light aliens, living life in the speed of light, experiencing the Universe in no time?I see dirty spots in the glass, where the light doesn’t pass through as clearly. The dirt might be calcium from the water, or whatever, making the glass more opaque. Why is clean glass more see-through than calcium? The electrons in the glass structure require more energy than the visible light carries, to get excited to a higher level, hence visible light does not get absorbed by glass material. It might stop UV-light, but we don’t see UV. We could see it as a tan if we stayed long enough directly in the sun.Back to the glass and the dirty spots, is it just me, or do they look a bit like stars spread across the surface of the glass? A nebula in a glass of wine.Indeed there is a whole Universe in a glass of wine.I see a randomly placed bookmark with the text “Mellem linjerne” which means “between the lines” in Danish. Do we need to read between the lines, when we have science and the unambiguous language of math? It depends on the lines that we define. Usually, we have to make our complex world simpler, by defining structures and lines, to be able to understand it better. If we want to know more, to answer the bigger questions, we need to go deeper and read between those lines. We have not been able to read all the small hidden letters of the whole Universe just yet, but we keep trying.I go back to the cat, and consider his instincts and desires, which are nothing but brain cell interactions, nothing but chemistry reacting, nothing but nerve impulses, and in the end, nothing but electromagnetic particle fields interacting with electron and protons, made of quarks, or whatever the current story we tell ourselves in the current time that we live in. Whatever knowledge we have accumulated and the ways we understand the world as is. There is still so much we don’t understand, and science is the process of always striving to uncover the secrets of the world.I see randomly written notes in my notebook, except they are not random, they are my thoughts and ideas. They are a structure, they are information, they have low entropy. Low entropy means that the atoms and particles would most probably not be able to form like this randomly. Only a small specific combination of particles would give us words written in a notebook. Low entropy that came from a higher entropy, meaning that work has been done and energy has been used. The cells in my body got energy from the surroundings, mostly from me eating other living things, whether they are plants or animals, hence locally lowering the entropy into structured proteins in my cells and making me able to form information, while leaving the world in a bigger mess and an always higher entropy, as they — we, I — leave byproducts in the form of CO2 and poop.I once again return to the cat, which is standing on the table, which again is standing on the balcony. I see that he is pulled to the ground by the huge gravity from the Earth, but even though the Earth is so extremely larger than the table and the balcony, its gravity is not large enough to pull the cat through the solid ground. Do you know why? It’s because the force of gravity is 10⁴³ times smaller than the force of electromagnetism, which is keeping solids from falling through the empty space in the atom. Because the empty space is not empty, it’s filled with virtual particles, which we call electromagnetic force or virtual photons being exchanged back and forth between the electron and the protons. And even a small solid table would have more force to keep the cat up than the whole massive Earth has to pull it down.I don’t see the cat’s head. Is the cat headless? No, because our mind reads between the lines, our brain is capable of saving patterns and structures and it recognizes the animal to be a cat which includes a head if it’s living and moving, even when I can’t see the head.And even though I am not in the picture, you might see an irresponsible cat owner, either because she lets her cat get so close to the edge of the balcony or because she doesn’t let it roam free outside, as is his nature. You also fill in the blanks in your brain and make your own connections.Look anywhere and you will see the Universe leaving its impressions. The physics is everywhere ❤ I don’t always understand it, but it leaves me with awe and wonder, and I want to know more.Stay curious to experience the magic of reality. You don’t have to be spiritual to find the Universe fascinating and try to figure out how to read between the lines and figure out the yet unknown. This is exactly what science is for.Predictwhere the future is writtenFollow347 2 Sign up for Predict NewsletterBy PredictMonthly updates on science and technology shaping our future. Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

philosophy and physics — 3:16,https://medium.com/science-and-philosophy/philosophy-and-physics-3-16-da67e43ce44c?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"Philosophy,Science,Physics,3am,Interview","Jonathan Bain interviewed by Richard Marshall.Jonathan Bain is an ice cool philosopher of physics. He broods on how intuitions are challenged by new theories, about Newtonian gravity, about whether physicists are running blind and the implications for philosophers, of whether we should be realists or anti-realists, about the nature of space and time, about the nature of Lee Smolin’s doubts about physics, about what the electron teaches us, about particles and fields, about structural realism and whether there can be different empty universes, about why Albert won the Krauss vs Albert spat and what to make of the multiverse. That’s one hell of a motherload! Keep it 100 yawl!3:AM: How did you become a philosopher?Jonathan Bain:I got interested in philosophy as an undergraduate physics major. I would get burned out on physics courses and then compensate by taking philosophy courses. My original plan was to go to graduate school in physics, but during my senior year I found a copy of Michael Friedman’s ‘ Foundations of Spacetime Theories ‘, which seemed incredibly interesting despite the fact that I could barely understand it. This led me to graduate school in history and philosophy of science, where I discovered that philosophy of physics was alot more interesting than physics itself, and that you could actually do philosophy of physics as a living.3:AM: You’re interested in working out how we should understand and interpret theories of physics. So I guess we’re going to have to see if we can get a grip on a whole host of stuff. But before looking at details, do you think that with quantum mechanics and relativity, contemporary theories about physics are more difficult to understand than previous physics, or has it always been a problem? It just seems a tad easier to relate experienced reality to a Newtonian universe, but maybe that’s just my ignorance talking?JB: There’s a sense in which this has always been a problem, at least to the extent that intuitions informed by past theories may sometimes conflict with proposals about how theories that supersede them should be interpreted. One might claim that there’s a “lag time” between intuitions and theories in physics.One way to see this is to note that for everyday, macroscopic, slow-moving objects (like cats, cars, and asteroids), Newtonian physics, relativity, and quantum mechanics all make exactly the same predictions (for all practical purposes). They only disagree about microscopic objects (like electrons and photons, say), and fast-moving and/or large-scale, megascopic objects (like particles moving in a particle accelerator, or black holes). Newtonian physics predicts that these latter sorts of objects behave, more or less, just like cats, cars and asteroids, whereas quantum theory and relativity predict that they behave differently; and there’s alot of evidence that confirms the latter predictions. So the problem may be in reconciling one’s intuitions about how macroscopic, slow-moving objects behave with what the evidence indicates about the behavior of microscopic, and/or fast-moving, and/or megascopic objects. I’d agree that there are aspects of relativity and quantum theory that make this reconciliation difficult, but this doesn’t seem like a new problem in the history of science: new theories tend to extent the reach of old theories into domains that aren’t immediately directly experientiable.(For instance, most people’s experience of falling objects would suggest that a hammer would hit the ground before a feather if both were dropped simultaneously from the same height, and they would be right, under typical scenarios. And perhaps most people would say this would happen even in non-typical scenarios in which one imagines nothing existing in the region surrounding the falling objects. But evidence (i.e., YouTube videos of astronauts on the moon dropping hammers and feathers) indicates that there are scenarios in which both hit the ground at the same time, regardless of the height. Reconciling everyday experience with the evidential record in this case amounts to replacing Aristotelian intuitions about falling objects with Gallilean/Newtonian intuitions.)3:AM: You have talked about different theories of Newtonian gravity as being empirically indistinguishable and you ask whether they really are different theories or just different ways of expressing the same thing? How could they be different if they are empirically indistinguishable? Aren’t some fundamental ideas about identity being violated if they are different?JB: There are versions of Newtonian gravity that (under a literal interpretation) describe spacetime as being curved, and describe gravity as a manifestation of this curvature (just like in general relativity); and there are other versions that describe spacetime as being flat, and describe gravity as an ontologically real field. And one can mount an argument that these curved and flat spacetime versions make all the same empirically testable predictions. One thing this argument assumes, perhaps, is some sort of distinction between in-principle observable objects, and in-principle unobservable objects, with the former being capable of detection by means of empirical tests, and the latter not. So two theories can be empirically indistinguishable in the sense that they agree on the predictions they make concerning the in-principle observable objects they posit, but disagree on the nature of at least one in-principle unobservable object they posit.3:AM:Reading some of the things Tim Maudlinsays it sounds like physics has got itself into a position where it knows how to solve engineering problems but is clueless about what any of the theories actually mean. Not only that, physicists since Bohr don’t see it as their problem. I think he also says that physics is using the wrong maths. So that just blows my head off! How far off am I with this impression that we’re running blind in physics?JB:In the early years of quantum mechanics, researchers were really very interested in philosophical issues, Bohr included! Historically I think we can probably blame World War II and the Cold War for current attitudes among many physicists towards philosophy ( David Kaiser has argued that the enrollment glut in physics graduate programs in the 50s and 60s motivated the pedagogical turn in teaching quantum mechanics away from philosophy and towards more of a “shut-up-and-calculate” mentality). It would be great if contemporary physics were running blind: more work for us philosophers! But there are alot of contemporary physicists who are deeply interested in foundational issues. Many of them work in quantum gravity and quantum information theory. I think these areas of physics are where the cutting edge stuff is being done. This is where new mathematical techniques (for instance, category theory) are being developed and deployed. And it’s also where there seems to be the most overlap between physics and philosophy of physics.3:AM:A key issue is whether contemporary physics is best understood as scientific realism or anti-realism. It seems that every theory is underdetermined, and this threatens any claim to realism. You’ve looked at an argument from Steven Weinberg to investigate this haven’t you? So what does the argument do and what does it conclude? Should we be scientific realists or not?JB:Weinberg has an argument to the effect that quantum field theory is the way it is because it’s the only way to reconcile certain basic principles of quantum mechanics with certain basic principles of relativity. In other words, if you assume these principles, then you’re inevitably led to a unique theory (i.e., Weinberg’s version of quantum field theory). On the surface, this seems like a foil to claims that anti-realists make about theories in physics being underdetermined. In particular, one can agree that, for instance, theories A and B are underdetermined by empirical evidence, but that nevertheless, there are other reasons to pick theory A over theory B. Theory A, say, may be (in some sense) uniquely entailed by some set of basic principles, while theory B may not be. This isn’t necessarily an argument in support of realism; rather, it suggests that naive claims about underdetermination don’t necessarily hold up under scrutiny. I think we should be scientific realists of a certain type, but for different reasons.3:AM: One of the big issues you grapple with is the question about what space and time are. Modern spacetime physics fuses them into a single thing doesn’t it? But there’s an argument, ‘the hole argument’ that suggests general relativity has things in its mathematical structure that don’t correlate with physical reality. Is that right? How do you go about sorting out the issues around all this?JB: The standard interpretation of special and general relativity entails that space and time are fused into a single thing, spacetime; but there are other ways to interpret these theories that attempt to uphold a more traditional ontological distinction between space and time (and the standard interpretation itself comes in many different versions). However, the typical way questions about the nature of space and time are cashed out is in terms of two historical positions: substantivalism and relationalism. Substantivalism claims that space, and/or time (and/or spacetime) exist as physical things (in some sense), independently of other physical things. Relationalism claims that space, and/or time (and/or spacetime) exist, but consist merely in the relations between physical things. The hole argument is an argument against a particular substantivalist interpretation of general relativity (what’s called “manifold substantivalism” by afficianados). It’s basically a reformulation, in the context of general relativity, of Leibniz’s shift argument against Newton’s concept of absolute space. Leibniz claimed that the existence of absolute space would violate his principle of the identity of indiscernibles and his principle of sufficient reason. An essential part of his argument involves imagining a “shift” of states of affairs (i.e., the world) in absolute space, and then comparing shifted and unshifted states of affairs.The hole argument claims that if spacetime exists in the manner in which manifold substantivalists say it does, then general relativity would violate a particular notion of determinism. And an essential part of the hole argument involves imagining an analogous shift of states of affairs (the only difference is that the shift and the states of affairs in the general relativistic context are defined in a different way than they are in Leibniz’s argument). In both arguments (from a contemporary point of view), the shifts are defined by symmetry transformations (spatial translations and velocity boosts in Leibniz’s argument, which are symmetries of Newton’s laws of motion; and diffeomorphisms in the hole argument, which are symmetries of Einstein’s equations). The general idea in both cases is to demonstrate that an interpretation of a theory that awards distinct ontological status to two objects related by a symmetry transformation may lead to problems. One conclusion is that one should restrict one’s ontology to equivalence classes of objects related by symmetry transformations (in some theories, these are called gauge-invariant objects).A huge industry of responses to the hole argument grew and flourished in the 90s, but it’s since died down a bit. Interestingly enough, just as it was dying down among philosophers, the hole argument was picked up by physicists working in quantum gravity. It turns out (unsurprisingly) that how one interprets general relativity may influence how one attempts to extend it to a theory of quantum gravity.3:AM:Lee Smolin in ‘The Trouble With Physics’ thinks physics has got stuck and in ‘Time Reborn’ thinks it’s because it can’t admit the reality of time. Is he right?JB: I think to understand these concerns, and the extent to which they’re well-motivated, it may help to first consider the cultural history of quantum gravity. Lee Smolin plays no small role in this history. It’s a history of two opposing camps: the relativitists, who approach the elusive quantum theory of gravity from the point of view of general relativity; and the particle physicists, who approach quantum gravity from the point of view of quantum field theory. (The task of constructing a quantum theory of gravity is the task of reconciling general relativity with quantum theory; this is hard since these two theories are conceptually, logically, and mathematically incompatible with each other.)The second camp (the particle physicists) generally now call themselves string theorists, and they’ve been the most market savvy: they get themselves on PBS science shows and write big glossy books about the nature of reality. The two camps were initially quite distinct, but alot of overlap between them has slowly developed. Smolin belongs to the relativitist camp. One problem that this camp faces is called the “problem of time”. This is a problem with how to interpret classical general relativity. The problem is that, under a typical way of understanding what counts as an observable of a theory, and what counts as representing change, (under which most theories in physics can be said to describe observables that change in time), the observables of general relativity do not change. This typical way (the “constrained Hamiltonian” formalism) is important for the relativitist camp since the standard way of turning a classical theory (like general relativity) into a quantum theory is based on it.I don’t think string enthusiasts consider this to be that much of a problem, since this problem doesn’t affect other classical field theories, even when they’re formulated in the problematic way (this is actually one way of understanding the incompatibility of quantum versions of these theories and general relativity). I’m definitely not qualified to pass judgment on either camp. Personally, though, I’d like to think that the eventual quantum theory of gravity will be something Completely Different from either general relativity or string theory.3:AM: It seems that there’s a lot of stuff in physics that doesn’t correlate with physical reality. You say we should look to the electron to learn navigational lessons about this kind of issue. So what do we learn from the history of the electron?JB: We should learn, I think, that object-oriented ontologies are typically not robust under theory change. What seems to be more robust are structure-oriented ontologies (although what the latter amounts to is not all that clear, I admit). There’s an argument that’s sometimes mounted by anti-realists against scientific realism called the “pessimistic meta-induction”. In one form, it claims that there have been theories in the past which have warranted our belief (i.e., that have met our standards of epistemic warrant), although today we don’t think they should be interpreted literally (since they refer to things, like the ether, say, that contemporary theories don’t think exist). The conclusion then is that we should not literally interpret current theories that similarly warrant our belief. In this form, the argument concerns the stability of reference across theory change (although perhaps it’s better to characterize this as the stability of certain types of ontologies across theory change).The history of the electron suggests that referential stability at the level of objects that possess properties may be lacking, but stability at the level of structure may not be: As an individual object, the electron went through alot of character redevelopment during the early part of the 20th century, arguably to the point where newer versions of it appeared unrecognizable from earlier versions; but the structure associated with it (perhaps as encoded in the Hamiltonian or Lagrangian associated with it) remained fairly recognizable during the same period, and still does.3:AM: Another area where it seems there are difficulties for interpreting the theories is the relationship between particles and fields. Is this to do with the difficulty of accounting for the world as we experience it from the formalism of Relativistic Quantum Field theories?[QCD Vakuum ( source: wiki.arcs.org.au/bin/view/Main/ILDG)]JB: This is certainly the view that most philosophers of physics hold (also many physicists). In particular, they think that intuitions about particles can’t be upheld in quantum field theory. The argument involves first identifying pre-theoretic intuitions about the nature of a particle, and then identifying the mathematical representations that support these intuitions, and finally arguing that these mathematical representations are not always well-defined in all quantum field theories. I think this argument at best demonstrates that intuitions about particles informed by previous theories may not be appropriate in the context of quantum field theory, but I don’t think this means that quantum field theory cannot be given a particle interpretation. In general, I don’t think we have built-in, pre-theoretic intuitions about experience; rather, our intuitions about experience are informed, implicitly or explicitly, by theories.3:AM: I guess perhaps this question ought to be asked first — are fields real? Are is this a parade case of anti-realist mathematical formalism?JB: The same argument that claims particle interpretations of quantum field theory aren’t viable is equally effective against field interpretations, too (the sorts of mathematical representations that support particle interpretations can be mapped onto mathematical representations that support field interpretations). Since I don’t think the argument works against particles, I don’t think it works against fields, either. Personally I think quantum field theory is a theory about both particles and fields, at least as it’s typically formulated by physicists who actually use it to derive and test predictions. If the sorts of things it refers to under the labels “particles” and “fields” don’t fully meet prior intuitions about particles and fields, then so much the worse for these intuitions.3:AM:Structural realism seems to suggest that structure exists independently of objects that instantiate it. Doesn’t this mean that Roy Sorensen is right to say that you could have two totally empty universes that are nevertheless different?JB: In the philosophy of science literature, there are two main variants of structural realism, one ontic (structures really exist) and the other epistemic (our theories at most give us knowledge of structure). The ontic version has many flavors. A “moderate ontic structural realist” claims that structures and objects co-exist and are mutually interdependent. A “radical ontic structural realist” claims that structures exist independently of objects. According to this latter creature, structure is supposed to be something; it’s just a different sort of something than objects. So two universes devoid of objects could still contain differing structures and thus be different.3:AM: Now you defend structuralist interpretations of spacetime don’t you? So how do you do this and how do you deflect the idea discussed in the last question that you are committed to relations without relata?JB: I’ve tried to motivate radical ontic structural realism with respect to spacetime by considering different formulations of certain applications of general relativity that disagree over the ontological status of objects. There are solutions to the Einstein equations that describe spacetimes with asymptotic boundary conditions (these solutions can be used to model spacetime singularities or arbitrarily curved spacetimes that behave more simply in the asymptotic limit). One way of formulating them (using tensor fields and a differentiable manifold) seems to support an ontology of objects and properties/relations. An alternative way of formulating them (using category theory) seems to support an ontology of structure devoid of objects.I think the argument against radical ontic structural realism based on the slogan “no relations without relata” assumes a set-theoretic understanding of structure. In set theory, perhaps, it makes sense to say there can be no relations without relata (given typical extensional definitions of relations, at least). But there are other formalisms that you might consider in trying to develop a concept of structure. In particular, category theory seems to suggest a notion of structure that can be divorced from relata.3:AM:Talking of nothing, what do you make of the recent spat between philosophers and physicists in the Kraus vs Albert affair? Was Albert right to say that Kraus misunderstood the philosopher’s question, and even if he did, was it a case where the philosopher’s question becomes redundant, as Dennett recently commented?3:AM:I agree with Albert’s critique. I think the gist of it is that Krauss could have meant two things by the term “nothing” in the title of his book (“A Universe from Nothing: Why There is Something Rather Than Nothing”). If by “nothing”, he meant what philosophers (and theologians) have traditionally meant by “nothing”, then he fails to provide an explanation for the why question implied by his subtitle. I take it that what he explains in his book is how vacuum states in relativistic quantum field theory can, under certain initial conditions, evolve into states which describe non-trivial matter/energy content. This is an explanation of how something, maybe a bit more complex, can come from something, maybe a bit less complex. It’s not an explanation of how something can come from nothing in the traditional philosophical sense (although I personally find this traditional philosophical question a bit dull and uninteresting). If by “nothing” Krauss meant “a vacuum state in QFT”, then he does provide an explanation for the why question implied by his subtitle, but I think he’s being disingenuous in portraying this explanation as relevant to the traditional philosophical debate.Whether physics makes such traditional debates redundant is an interesting question. Forget about the turf battle between physics and philosophy, there’s an even more bitter turf fight that occasionally flares up between philosophers of physics and philosophers who work in analytic metaphysics. Some of the former accuse some of the latter of relying too much on naive intuitions; and that the best-informed metaphysics comes from an (up-to-date) understanding of physics. I’m a bit sympathetic to this view. But in any event, you don’t need quantum field theory and cosmology to make this point. All you need to realize is that questions like “Why is there something rather than nothing?” are irrelevant to an understanding of physical phenomena, and that what’s more relevant are the sorts of questions that theories in physics can address (like “How can a vacuum state in relativistic quantum field theory evolve into a state with non-trivial matter/energy content?”).3:AM:What are we to make of the multiverse?JB: I think the multiverse is a very good way for cosmologists to get up to speed on topics in contemporary philosophy of science; in particular, contemporary analyses of the relation between theory and evidence (as opposed to outdated ones based on falsificationism), the nature of probabilistic inferences, and the nature of scientific explanations. One issue in the multiverse literature is how to define a probability measure over the set of multiverses. John Norton, for instance, has (I think persuasively) argued that certain features of typical measures are inadequate to represent some of the epistemic scenarios in which multiverses are posited (in particular, “fine-tuning” scenarios that seek to explain why certain fundamental constants have the values they do). These scenarios are characterized by claims that have completely neutral support from current evidence (current theories take the values of fundamental constants as brute facts), and using additive measures to represent how probable such claims are risks conflating this neutrality of evidential support with disfavoring evidence. On the other hand, if there are dynamical (or ontological) reasons, say, for positing multiverse scenarios, as opposed to epistemic reasons, then multiverse research becomes a bit more interesting. The many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics is an example of the latter.3:AM: And finally, can you recommend five books that will help us go further into this weird but crucial philosophical world?JB: Here’s a list of texts that address some of the issues above. (The last two are pretty technical; the last is actually a textbook on quantum field theory, but it’s remarkable for it’s in-depth coverage of many philosophical and conceptual topics.)Quantum Mechanics and Experience, David AlbertPhilosophy of Physics: Space and Time, Tim MaudlinEverything Must Go, James Ladyman and Don RossTopics in the Foundations of General Relativity and Newtonian Gravitation Theory, David MalamentThe Conceptual Framework of Quantum Field Theory, Tony DuncanABOUT THE INTERVIEWERRichard Marshallis still biding his time.Originally published at https://316am.site123.me.Science and PhilosophyMedium’s center for scientifically-informed content.Follow5 Sign up for Science and PhilosophyBy Science and PhilosophyCollections of the best scientifically-informed content on medium. Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

Faith and Physical Existence Are the S,https://medium.com/@tal.zlot/faith-and-physics-are-the-same-thing-heres-proof-a90e7fac6ce9?source=tag_archive---------4-----------------------,"Faith,Physics,Existentialism","By Tal J ZlotnitskyI’m not an expert on anything, let alone theology or physics. If you’re someone that opened this story, hoping for the answer to this question from someone with decades of experience in either of these fields — I am afraid you’ll have to either accept far lesser authority, or stop reading. By lesser authority, I mean a complete lay-person, in no way more entitled to an opinion on this matter than anyone else.I submit, also, that this reflection I’m about to share has been expressed previously in some form or fashion by Plato and Aristotle, among others. I’m sharing it because I’ve personally never heard this reflection quite THIS way before — and as a deeply-curious person who does read and actively seeks information, the fact that I have never come across this reflection means it may not be widely in circulation. Descsartes came closest, but he’s not exactly Everyman.So without further adieu — my reflection:Most faith-skeptics cite one incontrovertible fact which no person of faith who possesses all of her senses can refute: Even if you personally believe the biblical recitation describing the interaction between God and the rarest among us who have interacted with the almighty, you yourself have not yet seen God.Most of us who do have faith, hope to meet our maker one day. Many others may be unsure about the existence of a higher power, but we hope it exists. Both groups hope to do enough good in this world and in this lifetime to deserve to meet our God.But that’s not the point I’m making. The point is that even if you are such a person of faith, you have yet to physically meet this God in this lifetime.If you say otherwise, you mean it metaphorically.To a skeptic, that’s enough to say, then how do you know this God really exists?Here’s my reply, in the form of two simple questions, to my esteemed friends and to our fellow travelers, the faith-skeptics.I’ll start with a yes or no question:Do you believe in the physics of your own existence?99.9% of you will say that you do. My follow up question is:Who is reading this article right now?Once you process this question — which is not as easy to process as it may appear — most of you would answer this question, I am.But who is this I you’re speaking of?Some of you would answer that with my soul, others with my brain. In either case, we would each be conceding that whatever we consider to be our present physical existence is the entity reading this article.In either case, it’s safe to assume you’ve met neither your soul nor your brain — this entity. You’ve neither seen them, touched them, smelled them, heard them, tasted them… Even if it were possible for you to see your brain, you did not personally discover it’s functions; you are the disciple of the people who had, and who passed this knowledge on, to be accepted by (most of) the rest of us as… well, as gospel.99.9% of us would accept that our own soul/brain — in the physical realm in which we each exist — is very much real. That life is not a simulation.In other words, your experience of your own soul/brain is, to you, entirely fact-based. Think of that word — fact — in this context — my soul, my brain.So, is our existence fact, or is it faith?Whichever way you answer the above question — whether you believe your own soul or brain’s existence is fact or faith —any explanation you provide would also prove and affirm the other. Ergo, they must be equally true at all times. And anything that’s 100% the same, is... one thing.Try it.Therefore, if you believe we exist, you believe. The only questions then becomes, what do you choose to believe, and how do you choose to act.Written byTal J ZlotnitskyTal J Zlotnitsky is the President & CEO of iControl Data Solutions, a Bethesda, Md.-based SaaS provider of DSD workflow automation & consolidation solutionsFollow101 101 101 FaithPhysicsExistentialismMore from Tal J ZlotnitskyFollowTal J Zlotnitsky is the President & CEO of iControl Data Solutions, a Bethesda, Md.-based SaaS provider of DSD workflow automation & consolidation solutionsMore From MediumWhy Do You Think Vicars Are Boring?William ListerConscious RealityChris WickWho Lives, Who Dies, Who Writes Your Midrash?Rabbi Sara Mason-BarkinFaith is Paradoxical — Big Risk, but True CertaintyLindy Pegler in KoinoniaTo my son on the day of his first haircutAdam RosenzweigBut God Looks at the HeartDan Foster in Backyard ChurchThe Doctrine of Signatures: Reading the Signs of NatureSarah BaldwinCrafting a Daily RuleLagan Valley VineyardAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Journey of“our”universe : Part -1,https://medium.com/@saimahadevgande/journey-of-our-universe-part-1-77b2aff5d5f7?source=tag_archive---------5-----------------------,"Science,Space,Physics,Science Education,Science Fiction","Have you ever wondered how the stars , galaxies and planets were formed?. Ever wondered how life started?. Ever wondered how earth formed?. well, stop wondering. And let’s study and understand every thing about space. In this part, we will understand how universe made planets, stars and galaxies.Big Bang :There are many theories , proposed by many scientists on “how the universe is formed ?”. Among all of them the Big Bang is very famous. Big Bang is famous because it is proved to some extent that it might have happened, although it is not completely proven, compared to other theories it had more chance of happening. A Belgian priest named “George Lemaitre” first suggested the big bang theory in the 1920s.Now, I’m gonna take you back 1,38,200,00,000 years when there were no planets, no stars, no blackhole’s , and time itself doesn’t exist , and no space. If time doesn’t exist, then the modern physics formulas , equations , theories are not going to work . The big bang theory could say about what happened after the birth of that particle, but couldn’t explain what happened before that. So at this point, there was nothing in space. Everything is void. Now, from this void , birth of a small particle of size less than that of an atom with temperature more than a 100trillion degree Fahrenheit with huge energy took place . Let’s stop here and understand the concept. How the hell did a particle took birth from a void? . Well, that’s the only thing that scientist’s and astronomers couldn’t explain . Some people say that’s because of god. So,scientist’s came up with a question , If there is no time before Big Bang, then how can he exist? Now don’t say that he can control time.Well, let’s continue with our concept, many people think that big bang was a explosion but it’s not. For better understanding, let us suppose that you are infiltrating a ballon, and it expands, similarly that particle started expanding with huge energy, now “time” took birth .Before this point, time didn’t exist. so according to scientists whatever happened before this point was meaningless. So, universe started expanding with more than speed of light (more than 3,00,000km/s). In the present situation, there is no matter. Space was filled with pure energy. Now, account to Albert Einstein’s E=MC^2 matter can be converted to energy and energy can be converted to matter. So, energy is now being converted to matter.Matter and antimatter :During the big bang , the energy released was converted into matter and anti matter particles . When the matter particles collide with antimatter particles they combine and again they explode , releasing the energy. Now, universe had to make stars, galaxies, and planets. During the process, When the matter particles collide with antimatter particles, they release energy, which is meaningless in formation of the universe .So, luckily for every 1,00,00,00,00,000 anti matter particles , 1,00,00,00,00,001 were made. So, when 1,00,00,00,00,000 anti matter particles combine with 1,00,00,00,00,001 matter particles, one matter particle is remained. Likewise, the reaction took place continuesly and formed the galaxies, stars, planets , which really is fascinating.Do you know that the time took place for this whole process was 1millionth of a second (take a second and make it a million parts, the time took for this process was 1 part in that million). Within this 1millionth of a second, the universe expanded from a particle to 60 Billion miles. At this time, the temperature in the universe was 18trillion degree Fahrenheit .Formation of stars :As the universe started expanding the temperature started decreasing . So, the in the remaining particle of the matter . proton , neutron , electron ,started combining and formed the lightest elements in the periodic table (hydrogen, helium). At this time, the whole universe was filled with clouds of hydrogen and helium. It took universe 380,000years for this, and at this point the temperature was 4900 degree Fahrenheit and expanded to 100 million light years.Now, this hydrogen and helium started combining, and due to their gravitational force started making other particles revolve around them and they formed stars . Due to the pressure and temperature in the core , hydrogen and helium started fusing , which lead to formation of life supporting elements (oxygen, calcium and magnesium..etc..).Supernova :Now, the universe need to make planets. But, the heavy metals which were needed for the formation of planets weren’t formed yet. And the energy of stars isn’t enough for their formation. Until, the stars started exploding . This explosion is called as supernova , all the elements of the periodic table formed after this explosion . Because of this explosion all the elements were spread throughout the universe. Consider our body, iron in our blood, calcium in our bones, oxygen we are breathing, all these elements were formed from supernova. Now the age of the universe is 9 billion years, and expanded to 3 trillion light years, and temperature is -452degree Fahrenheit.All the dust and gases that were evolved from supernova started revolving around each other and formed galaxies. Due to the gravitational force, all the particles started forming in the shape of a ball and started burning, these were the stars like our sun. Similarly all the galaxies and our planets formation took place.Our Home:Our galaxy was named “milky way”. there are more than 300,00,00,00,000 stars which are bigger than the size of our sun in our galaxy. There are more than 200,00,00,00,000 galaxies just like milky way in our universe. Imagine what’s our size in the universe.Why big bang is popular than other theories :There are so many reasons why the Big Bang Theory is so popular than the other’s. In the year 1920 a person named Edwin hubble was observing outer space using his telescope noticed that each and every galaxy is moving away from each other , he thought that if every galaxy is moving away from each other, then they might have been at a same place in past , from this it was proved that the universe is expanding From a small point.Mr. Edwin HubbleApart from that in the year 1964 Robert Wilson and Arno penzias found C.M.B (cosmic microwave background radiation). when the light which is formed during Big Bang started expanding with space, because of change in its wavelength from visible to I.R region are traveling in our universe till now. They discovered those waves were released at the time of big bang, and they both were awarded with Nobel Prize.Mr. Robert Wilson and Arno penziasHowever all the planets , life and our formation took place because of the elements that were released from the explosion supernova .Till now we understood how stars and galaxies were formed , In next article we will try to understand much more about space....Written bySai Mahadev GandeFollow29 1 29 29 1 ScienceSpacePhysicsScience EducationScience FictionMore from Sai Mahadev GandeFollowMore From MediumMapping Dark Matter and Dark Energy with a cosmic filterRobert Lea in PredictThe Evening Planets are on Parade and Deep Sky Objects are out, but it’s all about Meteors!Star WalkThe Moon had a Really Rough DayJames Maynard in The Cosmic CompanionDon’t Miss These 7 Spectacular Sights Of The Summer SkyEthan Siegel in Starts With A Bang!Black Hole Imaging & Katie BoumanHaley Demos5 Creepiest Places in the UniverseWynsteriaSpace law revisited: Are weapons of mass destruction prohibited in space?ICRC in Humanitarian Law & PolicyThe Case of ALH84001Ella AldersonAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

My Ultimate Physics & Astronomy Reading List,https://medium.com/@AubreyWaters/my-ultimate-physics-astronomy-reading-list-85e836ee86ad?source=tag_archive---------7-----------------------,"Books,Astronomy,Physics,Science,Science Communication","Photo by: AuthorOf all the sciences, Physics and Astronomy are the two disciplines I see requests for reading lists over. It makes sense of course. They are the oldest, and most primal disciplines responsible for quite literally everything humanity has accomplished.Doubt that?A quick example: think about the seasons and agriculture.Understanding the change in the seasons, when the rains come, when to harvest, when to plant — all 7 cradles of civilizations relied on an intimate knowledge of the stars. Knowledge of the stars led to the development of agriculture, which in turn birthed dense population centers, government, political discourse, specialization, skilled labor in things that were not agriculture, etc. Everything on Earth, everywhere on Earth started with Astronomy.Physics and Astronomy are at the core of what it means to be human.Which is why I’ve decided to finally put together my own reading list for anyone who wants to dive into our core shared humanity and learn more about our shared cosmic context.None of the books on this list are textbooks.Books that involve math and equations will be marked with a *, books that are math heavy and may require an understanding of calculus will be marked with **.The ListUnderstanding Physics by: Isaac Asimov *Guide to Earth & Space by: Isaac Asimov*Astrophysics in a Nutshell by: Dan Maoz*Cosmos by: Carl SaganPale Blue Dot by: Carl SaganBillions and Billions by: Carl SaganComet by: Carl Sagan & Ann DruyanDragons of Eden by: Carl SaganShadows of Forgotten Ancestors by: Carl Sagan & Ann DruyanThe Varieties of Scientific Experience by: Carl SaganThe Demon-Haunted World by: Carl SaganMapping the Heavens by: Priyamvada NatarajanBlack Hole Wars by: Leonard SusskindThe Road to Reality by: Roger Penrose **Cycles of Time by: Roger PenroseA Big Bang in a Little Room by: Zeeya Merali4% Universe by: Richard PanekThe Feynman Lectures (3 volumes) by: Richard Feynman**6 Easy Pieces & 6 Not-so Easy Pieces by: Richard FeynmanStorm in a Teacup by: Helen CzerskiOn the Shoulders of Giants by: Stephen Hawking (compiler and partial author)*The Universe in a Nutshell by: Stephen HawkingA Brief History of Time by: Stephen HawkingFinding our Place in the Universe by: Helene CourtoisQuantum Mechanics: The Theoretical Minimum by: Leonard Susskind & Art FriedmanWarped Passages by: Lisa RandallDark Matter and the Dinosaurs by: Lisa RandallThe Edge of Physics by: Anil AnanthaswamyThrough Two Doors at One by: Anil AnanthaswamyBlack Hole Blues by: Janna LevinPlanet Hunters by: Lucas EllerbroekChaos by: James GleickEngineering, specificallyStructures: Or Why Things Don’t Fall Down by: J.E Gordon *Fundamentals of Astrodynamics by: Roger R.

Canadian Astronomy is not inclusive and doesn’t want to be,https://medium.com/@hildingneilson/canadian-astronomy-is-not-inclusive-and-doesnt-want-to-be-18a8be3f34a7?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Indigenous People,Astronomy,Academia,Inclusion,Physics","I work in academic astronomy in Canada. I might be the only First Nations faculty member in astronomy and maybe even physics in this country. I am not welcome in my field because I am Indigenous and because I work to create space for Indigeneity in physics and astronomy. My field directly benefits from colonization that allows for telescopes on Indigenous lands and my field leads in exclusion by diminishing Indigenous knowledges. This isn’t because of my field but the professors who influence and lead it. Not all faculty in Canada are bad people, but almost no one actually does anything to fight for changes beyond waiting for problem faculty to retire. I don’t know if my story is unique or common for Indigenous people in physics and astronomy in Canada, I doubt there have been enough Indigenous people in Canada with PhDs in physics and astronomy to say for certain. Academia needs to change.The InterviewIt has been two years since they tried to end my academic career. Two years ago I was invited to interview for a tenure-track position as part of a program aimed to increase faculty representation of Indigenous people at a satellite campus of the University of Toronto. During that interview I was harassed and insulted for being Indigenous and advocating that we in STEM support and integrate Indigenous knowledges in our classrooms. The main incident of that interview occurred in a small meeting room with too many people where we had lunch. It was a small room and there were too many people in it. I was harassed and some people demanded that I justify Indigenous knowledges to science as they compared it to young-Earth creationism and homeopathy. At the same time another faculty member decided to ask me how much Indigenous I am? I sat there trapped in a small room where I couldn’t leave, trying to talk but instead being condescended to by the same people who would decide my career prospects. I sat there having my existence questioned. The interview was sabotaged.Afterwards, the chair of that department tried to convince me I would not be judged on being Indigenous or anything related to discussing Indigenous knowledge. He tried to convince me that I would only be judged on my research record. Before the end of the two-day interview, there was a dinner where one of the faculty, a different one, spent a long time asking how can I ever obtain research funding through research focused on Indigenous knowledge. It was a clear denial of the value of the knowledge and a clear perspective that I was not considered qualified. Unfortunately, that faculty member did not interact with or take the five minutes to look up my more western-science research activities.I was shocked but not really surprised when I received an email a few weeks later telling me that I would not be offered the faculty position. I was the only person interviewing for that position and I was not considered worth hiring. The chair wrote a lot of words in that email to convey some sort of explanation of why the search committee did not choose to offer me the position, but was really just confusing and obtuse. That email purposely avoided saying anything directly or honestly. The process had absolutely no transparency nor accountability. The rejection was devastating because it was inappropriate, and anti-Indigenous discrimination.I contacted my faculty association for help and they suggested following an informal grievance process that started with sending a letter of complaint to the Dean in charge of that physics department. They also informed me that they would not pursue any complaints against any faculty, only the University. That Dean never responded to the letter and, after some months the legal representatives for the faculty association filed a formal complaint. That led to a meeting with a Vice-Dean who listened to my story and said they would try to help. I was told during that meeting that the Dean intended to send me a formal apology, but did not. I was later offered a one-year contract in a letter where the University of Toronto denied that the incidents affected the decision of the search committee. The letter further stated that I was being offered the one-year contract because the University wanted to help me. It was not an acknowledgement of what was done, nor did it seek to address any of the issues. The offer was really an attempt to gas light the entire experience.I declined that option because a one-year contract would not change anything. The University did not offer any further dialogue and about another six months passed. I had only about eight months left on the contract for that time and I could not afford to live in Toronto or stay in academia without a salary. The faculty association representative suggested that the only way to convince the University of Toronto to pay attention was to file a complaint to the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario (HRTO). This was because these complaints are public. I submitted the complaint.The University responded very differently to the HRTO complaint. The University agreed to a mediation if I suspended my HRTO complaint. It was done and we went to mediation. That happened about a year after the job interview and only about four months before the end of my contract. I was working for a year living with the reality that I was not wanted nor considered good enough to do the job I was doing because I am Indigenous. No one in a position of power or authority cared enough to do anything but deny it. The irony is that the University was more than happy to note I am Indigenous when they were trying to get a prestigious research chair. Indigenous is only wanted when it buys credibility.The mediation was a one-day meeting with a person to lead the negotiations. When I arrived it was made clear that the few hours of discussion were the only times available and that if I left with no settlement I would have to wait more than a year for the next steps in the process. This was stated as a simple truth. I could settle or I could be unemployed. I was assured that what happened was bad and inappropriate, but also that what happened did not impact their decision to not hire me. Apparently discrimination in public doesn’t mean that discrimination would happen behind closed doors.There was a settlement because they left me with only two choices: accept the University “offer” or leave academia. I didn’t want to leave, I still don’t. So, I accepted the agreement. Afterwards, the University representatives asked to shake hands, I barely remember it. After everything I was left empty, but one thing that stood out was one of the Union representatives mentioned that it was common for people to feel regret about it.The settlement was simple — a five-year contract where I have to do a midterm-term-tenure review in year three, that is a review by faculty to make sure a person is progressing reasonably towards a later tenure review. The review is in name only. If I pass the review, my contract is extended for two years. I have to jump through tenure-track hoops for the privilege to hang on in academia. There is not much else to the settlement. They attempted a non-disclosure clause, but withdrew it as it would have violated academic freedom. I did not receive salary raise to be paid equitably with respect to my colleagues. I had to fight to increase my research funding from the University while other contract hires got the same amount simply for showing up. I was told that the University was making a big sacrifice by extending my contract for another five years because there is an internal rule that contract faculty can only be hired for five years and no longer. They extolled their virtues by claiming they were making a significant sacrifice by breaking their own self-imposed rule. I was told I should be grateful.The year since…It has been a year since that agreement and nothing has changed by intention. I work at the main campus and the faculty there are similar to the faculty at the satellite campus where I interviewed. Behaviors continue to be dismissive and degrading. There have been outright racist and anti-Indigenous comments. I have been asked to give free and non-credited labor and, in one case, to give labor that cost me money.There are examples of prejudice. One faculty member sent an email claiming Indigenous people are less than medieval and are uncivilized as part of a discussion on telescopes and colonization. The email highlighted how right western science is and how scientists are bringing knowledge to these people. I called it racist and white supremacist. People were more offended by me calling out the email than the email itself where one person called me a communist (whatever that means to them). That faculty member filed a complaint about me and I filed one about them. I did not engage with that faculty member while they continued to send emails claiming they were going to get me and describing how they are not racist. Nothing happened to that faculty member. I had to discuss this with a couple of Deans who gaslit the interaction. I was told that the person did not say anything explicitly problematic and that my interpretation was not what they meant. As such, it did not rise to the level of an actionable incident. In the end I was told there would be a workshop on implicit bias that would be “sort of” mandatory for faculty.Another faculty member wrote a letter reflecting on racism in society where they cited how people consider it appropriate to “make comments about the dominant culture” and how racism grows from unconscious biases and that unconscious biases grow from seeing radicalized peoples get arrested, etc. That is, the person blamed radicalized peoples for racism. I called it out in a private message to faculty in my department and I asked that the person apologize and choose to participate in anti-racism training. The chair responded by saying I shouldn’t be talking about these things via Slack and said nothing about the manifesto. The manifesto was later deleted by the person without acknowledgement of the harm of what they wrote.These events occur regularly, and these event are not due to specific bad apples. It is a systemic problem with academic culture that hides from being transparent and has absolutely no accountability. In one instance, my department held a diversity and inclusion review and invited an organization to lead that review. That organization chose to focus on gender and sexual identities and not on Race and Indigeneity. I was told that I could still talk to them about my experiences as an Indigenous person. I did and I was ignored. As a result, I submitted documents and complaints to the Dean’s office and they agreed to host a review on Race and Indigeneity. The Dean’s office refused to commit to acting on any recommendations from that review, only that they would host it. Before that review was even held, the chair at that time sent an email noting that this review was “planned” to be done thereby completely erasing the work I did. The chair also noted that it was okay to say that our department is “post-racial”. This is a example of requiring free labor and then erasing that effort and is an example that these bad behaviors are endemic.That review occurred and eventually a report was released and sent only to faculty. Others were sent a one-page set of recommendations. That report has been dismissed quietly by faculty as being a result of some people being “political”. The chair quietly attempted to hide and bury the report and not implement any changes.During this same year, I have had some successes. I led a couple of recommendation papers for the Canadian astronomy community’s ten year review and participated on a couple of papers for the US review. I successfully earned two National Science and Engineering Research Council Grants. I gave public and research talks, I’ve been on a few accepted papers. I taught an undergraduate course that was new to me and received positive reviews despite moving online because of covid-19. I led a new graduate mini-course on astronomy and colonization (1/3 of a regular course). By most standards that is a pretty good academic year. But, it changes nothing.Yet, I am seen as less than qualified by faculty in my department. My University has a program for hiring Indigenous scholars, my department hasn’t been interested. My colleagues would rather not hire me even if it is free for the department. Colleagues have disparaged my teaching of Indigenous astronomy to undergraduate and graduate students as unscientific. They have referred to Indigenous peoples as irrelevant, referred to themselves as post-racial, referred to my work and to Indigenous knowledges as pseudo-science. Essentially, Indigenous people are not welcome in my department.It’s not just one bad departmentThis is my reality of my workplace and I have zero evidence that any other physics and astronomy department in Canada would be any better. I have enough experience to know this is not an example of one bad department or one bad institution. I interviewed at one institution where the Dean there noted that I was Indigenous and then spent ten minutes explaining in a panic that he had no input into the faculty search. Everyone else involved in that interview purposely avoided the fact that I am Indigenous. On a second occasion, I was visiting another department where one of the faculty bragged about how diverse their department is in terms of the number of women faculty. The brag erases Indigenous people and people of color. I simply had to smile through the discussion. And on yet another occasion, I worked with the Canadian Astronomical Society to develop an anti-racist statement. The leadership did not accept suggestions and offered their own statement that was the pathetic equivalent of thoughts and prayers. When I called out the leadership committee for agreeing to such a statement, I was warned to be careful. The leadership is supposedly representative of the best of Canadian astronomy, but are no better than my own institution.No astronomy or physics department in Canada comes close to being consistent with population demographics. There are almost no Indigenous people in Canadian astronomy and probably not too many more in Canadian physics. I might be the only First Nation person in an astronomy/physics faculty position in Canada. According to National Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), across all fields only 0.6% of Discovery Grant applications were from Indigenous people in 2019-2020 or about 20 Indigenous applicants. Also, 0.5% of all awards went to Indigenous people. NSERC doesn’t offer more direct statistical information. But, given that there are about 150–160 awards in physics in 2020 and that the success rate is better than 80% then there probably were about 200 applicants in physics and astronomy. That suggests on average an Indigenous person will receive an NSERC award most years and that there is about one Indigenous applicant per year. That suggests that there is at best 5–10 Indigenous people in the Canadian system. It would be valuable to know how Black People and other underrepresented People of Color fare but, NSERC reports only on gender (male, female, “other + prefer not to say”), Indigenous identity, people with a disability, and visible minorities. There is very little information available.Something needs to change. We need a field that advocates for people of diversity and is open to real change.Here are some ideas for change.Demographic information in astronomy and physicsCanada currently has very incomplete information regarding the number of people of diversity and non-binary gendered people in the field. Astronomers and physicists in positions of power and authority often deny issues because no one can point to simple and straightforward data. Having explicit data allows funding agencies and authorities to commit to changes and to penalize institutions and departments that refuse to change. This is also important for hiring committees. Canadian institutions require job searches to compile and obtain demographic information about applicants. That information is not shared with search committees at any time as far as I know. If demographic information is available for searches then committees should be required to justify any short-list that is inconsistent with demographic information and that justification should be publicly available.Actually hire People of Color and Indigenous peoplesThis isn’t rocket science. About twenty years ago, NSERC led a program to support hiring of women (and Indigenous people, though I am not aware of any Indigenous people being hired in this program) as science faculty. I don’t know how successful that program is considered, but I am sure it made a difference for a number of people. In astronomy it made a quick change to demographics and clearly demonstrated the priorities of funding agencies and governments. Hiring People of Color and Indigenous peoples into faculty positions can begin to change the system.Include training in our graduate and undergraduate programsWe teach astronomy as if it is a benevolent science that only benefits the entirety of humanity. We preach that the sky is for everyone and that everyone has access to astronomy. But, in so many ways we do not recognize the plethora of ways that we exclude people. We need training at every level of university education in Indigenous knowledges and cultural knowledges for astronomy. We need real inclusion training, not just that one workshop from that one enthusiastic person who reads someone else’s notes on microagressions and unconscious biases.Learn to respect Indigenous knowledges and ways of knowing and understand connections between astronomy and colonization.Astronomy is a science done by humans and is a science born out of Eurocentrism. That means that astronomy benefits from colonization and white supremacy just like any other field of science, art, etc. We need to recognize this. Today it is especially important we do so. We need to place Indigenous rights ahead of astronomy’s self-interest. Similarly, we need to include Indigenous knowledges of astronomy in our education. For those of us who live and work on Indigenous territories, we have an ethical duty to that land. But, that land includes the water, animals, air and the sky. Our programs need to be inclusive of Indigenous knowledges of astronomy and Indigenous methodologies of research. Doing so can only benefit science and create a more inclusive fieldAccountability for faculty regardless of tenure.In my experience there is no accountability for the behaviours of people with tenure at my institution. Tenure is the right to academic freedom, it is not the right to be prejudiced, nor the right to promote colonization. So many times, I have seen and had to deal with tenured people saying and doing whatever they wish. So many times I have had to watch not-yet-tenured faculty stay silent and wait until they have tenure themselves. We need a system of real accountability for the inappropriate actions whether it is accountability in performance reviews, mandatory training, and maybe even revoking tenure. I don’t know what accountability should look like with precision, only that there is absolutely no accountability. Tenured faculty have the power to deny the humanity of others as part of their job that behavior is defended.Transparency in hiring at every level.Hiring of faculty and post-doctoral researchers is largely a mystery to me. From the perspective of an applicant, I submit a portfolio and have three people write letters that I assume are supportive. Maybe I am invited for an interview, most likely I am not. If the latter, there is no feedback, no discussion of the criteria that was used, nothing. Sometimes, I might receive a form email at the end of the search. If there is an interview, there is some interaction for maybe a couple of days and then nothing for months. There might be some sort of feedback letter that says something about it being unfortunate they could not offer a job and that there were a number of qualified individuals. There is never anything about what was actually considered. All of that discussion is behind closed doors and is considered confidential. The only reason I was able to say anything about the process I went through is because the interviewers were arrogant enough to believe that they could be publicly inappropriate and prejudiced. If the interviewers had stayed silent in public and said everything behind closed doors that would have been nothing I could do or say. A lack of transparency protects faculty and permits racism, sexism and prejudices. Search committees should be audited externally, and search committees should be required to explicitly provide real feedback to people of diverse backgrounds.Things we need to stop doingThese are some vague ideas that might help an academic field that I am not welcome in. But, we also need to stopping doing a lot of things. People in positions of authority and responsibility seem to spend a lot of time protecting the comfort of those with tenure instead of people of diversity that are being kept out of the system. People in these positions are pretending to support change, but only the changes that they see as important and the changes that don’t upset the status quo.We need to stop advocating for silence.There have been a number of people, from legal experts to faculty and deans, who have suggested that it would be bad for me to openly talk about my experiences. The University of Toronto wanted me to accept a non-disclosure agreement. It is clear that a number of people would prefer me not to speak of my experiences. But, this does nothing to shield those with power and avoids any accountability. Those same people have made it clear I don’t have a place in academia. We need a culture where people can feel accepted and safe sharing their experiences.We need to stop accepting change is slow and we definitely need to stop saying it.So many well-meaning people have told me that change is slow but is happening. This includes highly respected colleagues and leaders. But, every time I hear that, I wonder how slow is okay? How long should we have to wait for change. I have four years remaining as a contract faculty. It is not likely there will be sufficient change in that time, and they acknowledge that. So, change is slow means I am not included. How many potential careers are being tossed aside because change is slow? How many lost lost careers are acceptable? Saying change is slow is not about advocating change but is about protecting the fragile egos of tenured faculty.We need to stop pretending that journal clubs and discussion clubs are change.We spend a lot of time discussing microagressions, implicit biases and EDI papers. That discussion focuses on the idea that science tells us there is a problem and we need to listen to science. But, the deniers in power and authority don’t care and don’t listen so it’s all talk. The discussion is usually confined to the same small group of well-meaning people who leave the discussion feeling like they did something positive. More reading is not needed if that is all there is.Stop focusing on demographics as the first step.Demographic statistics are important for quantifying the lack of diversity and inclusion in astronomy and physics. However, privacy laws mean there are significant limitations as to how much we can only ever learn. People in my field have focused a lot demographics as being an important part of change to the point that demographics is more important than actually changing the system that we all know is broken. Demographics help highlight the problem, but they are not change.ConclusionI don’t know if these suggestions are valuable or not. I am not sure I have faith in the system to change or even consider these suggestions. It has been made clear that there is no space for me in an academic system that only sees Indigeneity as a way to earn credit when doing only superficial things (my chair once bragged that a new astronomy building would have Indigenous art). I have no intentions of leaving academia and astronomy willingly. I am not sure that I have love for this work, but it is something I need to do. I fully expect, however, to be forced to leave once my contract expires. I don’t expect anything to ever be made right or even receive an apology from the people involved.

Approaches to Solving Problems in Physics,https://medium.com/cantors-paradise/approaches-to-solving-problems-in-physics-295a45ad45a7?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Physics,Learning,Students,Education","Becoming a master at physics requires a lot of work, but learning the techniques and guidelines in this article is taking the first step.The author made all images in this article using LaTeX, tikz, numpy, pyplot, and GIMP.People often talk about physics as if it were merely a set of facts and equations: F=ma, energy can neither be created nor destroyed, E = mc², stars are giant balls of hydrogen fusing into helium and heavier elements, etc. These facts and equations can either form the base of our understanding or result from our understanding, but to do physics is to connect the two. In other words, learning physics requires learning techniques and guidelines alongside facts and equations.I won’t be able to go through every single technique and guideline used in every single problem, but I do want to cover some of the most common techniques and guidelines used in physics.Use an Explicit Equation if You CanExcept in the specific case where you are asked to derive an equation, you can use the given equations to solve a decent number of problems using some plug and chug and basic algebra. As long as you know all but one value in the equation, you can get that one value.Example: Celestial MechanicsHow long would it take Earth to go around the sun if the mass of the sun were one one-hundredth of what it currently is and Earth’s orbit was unchanged?Kepler’s third law relates the mass of the sun, the radius/semi-major axis of the orbit, and the period of the orbit, so we can get the period by solving Kepler’s third law for T and plugging in the values we already know.An Advanced TrickWhenever you have a physics problem that changes a few values (in this case, the mass of the sun) in a formula, try to express your answer in terms of the values before the change. For this problem, we don’t have to look up any of these physical constants in the problem and we don’t even need a calculator.Note that the blue-green expressions are the same, so we can substitute it back in without having to know anything except that the Earth takes a year to go around the sun. You could get a similar result by dividing the period for the earth by the new period and canceling out terms.Extension of This PrincipleI’ve only discussed the case where you have a singular equation with one unknown, but if you have n equations, you can have n unknown values. We’ll go through specific examples later.Move Forward on Any Front, No Matter How SmallIf you ever find yourself in a situation where you don’t know how to get from the information given in the problem to what the problem asks of you, take the information you have and do something with it, even if you don’t know how it could help you. Physics often requires you to take what you know, find an equation that can get you some more information, and then repeat the process until you have enough information to answer the question. When following this technique, remember to look at all the information you have even if you’ve used it before.Example: KinematicsHow long does a runway need to be for an airplane with mass m moving with a constant net force F to reach a velocity vf from rest?The phrase “How long does a runway need to be” means you’re looking for a distance. You know the mass, the force, the initial velocity (0 m/s since you’re at rest), and the final velocity. Because you’re trying to use an explicit equation if possible, you look for any equation on your equation sheet, but you don’t find any. Remembering that you’re trying to get whatever information you can, you instead look for equations where you know all but one variable. You’ll find the classic F = ma, and realize that you know F and m, so now you have a, the acceleration. Now, you look for equations where you know all but one variable, and you find that one of the kinematic equations has a, s (distance/displacement), vi (initial velocity), and vf (final velocity):Realizing you know everything except for the distance, you can solve for the distance and answer the problem.With More ExperienceAs you get more experienced, you’ll remember patterns like “using F = ma and then using a kinematic equation to get velocity, time, or distance” and you won’t have to look through all the equations on the equation sheet to find the relevant equation. With all the time you’ve saved, you can work on other problems.I’ll give you methods that work in the examples for later sections, but I only figured them out because I kept following this guideline, making mistakes, and learning from them. There are only so many ways to make a mistake solving a problem. So long as you keep trying and you try to not make mistakes you’ve already made, you’ll run out of mistakes to make.Look at Each Dimension IndividuallyIn Cartesian coordinates (i.e. the standard (x, y, z) coordinate system) each dimension is orthogonal, meaning you can look at each dimension individually. In practical terms, you can create a system of equations with one equation per dimension. You can use this technique on any quantity that can be expressed as a vector, including velocity, momentum, forces, angular momentum, and torque.Extensions of this TechniqueIn higher level physics, you’ll see a few other extensions of this technique: the use of symmetry to reduce the number of equations you have to consider, the separation of variables technique, and the eigenfunction expansion technique (you can treat each eigenfunction as if it were a separate dimension). Since I don’t want to duplicate work and the separation of variables technique leads directly into an eigenfunction expansion, I’ll only do an example of the symmetry technique.Example: BallisticsIgnoring air resistance and assuming the curvature of the Earth is negligible, what is the maximum ground range of a cannon with muzzle velocity v?We can consider the x and y dimensions individually and use kinematic equations to solve for an answer. We’ll have to split the velocity into its x and y components using sine and cosine. Note that since we have a system of two equations, we can have two unknowns, as I said earlier in the Explicit Equation section. Unfortunately, we seem to have three unknowns since we don’t know θ, the angle the cannon is fired at, but we can get another equation since we’re trying to maximize the range. We’ll get the range in terms of a single unknown, then we’ll take the derivative of the range with respect to that unknown, set it to zero, solve for the unknown in the new equation, and then pick the solution that gets us the maximum value.In this case, we knowthe initial position: (0, 0)the initial velocity vector (in terms of other variables): (v cos θ, v sin θ)the acceleration vector (gravity pulling it down): (0, -g)We also know the final y position since the range refers to how far it goes before it hits the ground, which happens when y is zero again.Two kinematic equations relate initial velocity an initial acceleration to a position, and each has a different unknown. If we use the one that has the final velocity as an unknown (the one we used earlier), we end up within the x direction andin the y direction, where we took the negative solution since the cannonball is moving down when it hits the ground. This kinematic equation didn’t get us a distance because we couldn’t use information from one equation to solve the other and vice versa. If we instead use the kinematic equation that has time as an unknownwe end up withwhich means we can get an answer by solving for t in terms of θ or vice versa. Looking at the y equation yieldswhere we chose the nonzero solution of t since the cannonball is at (0, 0) at t = 0. Since we have t in terms of θ, we can plug it back into the equation for the range, which gets usNow, the only unknown is θ, so we want to find the angle that maximizes the distance fired, which we do by using the process described earlier in this section (or use the fact that the max of sin θ is 1 and skip this part).You can solve this equation in multiple ways, but I’m going to do it the pure math way (which will become more useful in later math and physics though it’s overkill for this problem). I’m also going to use radians because math and physics are generally easier with radians.The first equation comes from the fact that cos(θ) has a zero at 1/2 π (90 degrees) and repeats every integer multiple of π (180 degrees), which is what the right-hand side of the first equation means (1/2 π plus some integer multiple of π). From there, I divide both sides by 2 and end up with the possible values of θ. Since θ has to be in the range 0 (firing straight forward) to 1/2 π (firing straight up), the only θ that maximizes the distance the cannonball travels is 1/4 π (45 degrees).Plugging everything in gets us the final answer:Example: Balanced ForcesA car moves forward with a constant acceleration. Inside that car, a ring of mass m at equilibrium hangs from a taut string at an angle θ difference from hanging straight down, as shown in the diagram. Determine the acceleration of the car.Made with tikz and LaTeXThere are three forces on the ring:acceleration of the cargravitytension from the stringSince we’re dealing with forces on an object with a known net acceleration (i.e. 0 since it’s in equilibrium) and we know the directions of all the forces, we can draw a free body diagram.Note that the force from the car is entirely in the x direction, the force from gravity is entirely in the y direction, and the force from tension has both x and y components. As in the previous problem, we can break the tension force into its x and y components using sine and cosine. Note that since θ is relative to the positive y axis, we get the y component of the tension by multiplying by cos(θ), not sin(θ). Likewise, we have to multiply by sin(θ), to get the x component of the tension. By breaking this system into one equation per dimension, we end up withYou might be thinking that we’re stuck because we don’t know any of the forces right now besides gravity (it’s -mg). We can try a few things, but we can make the substitution F = ma, for all the forces, and since all forces are affecting the ring, we can do the followingAfter that, we solve for the acceleration of the car and end up with an expression in terms of the acceleration from the tension and θ.We know θ, so we need another equation that relates the acceleration from the tension to something else we know. In this case, it’s θ and g. Plugging the expression for the acceleration from the back into the acceleration from the car gets us our final answer of g tan(θ) through the process below.Notice that you didn’t need to use the mass of the ring even though it was given in the problem. In the real world, you’ll often have more information than you need, so you’ll need to figure out which information to use and which to ignore.A ShortcutSince the forces add up to zero, if you put the vectors end to end, they make a triangle with the tension force as the hypotenuse, the car force as the opposite side, and the force of gravity as the adjacent side, which means you can use the definition of tangent to get the answer. This shortcut is kind of rare to use, but it works here. If you’re confused about how to use this shortcut, don’t and use the procedure above.Example: Symmetry in Electric FieldsWhat is the electric field a distance r away from an infinitely long line of charge (i.e. a wire) with uniform charge density λ and no current?This problem will come up later in your study of physics and requires vector calculus to fully understand, but the general principle of symmetry still stands.If you wanted, you could integrate over the entire wire and get an answer, but Gauss’s Law requires less work (I can look at this problem and tell you the answer is λ/(2πεr) because the math is pretty easy with Gauss’s Law, but I’m going to go through the entire process so you understand what’s happening behind the scenes). To use Gauss’s Law as efficiently as possible, however, we have to find a complete set of surfaces that we can use anywhere on the wire such that the electric field doesn’t vary in magnitude or direction relative to the surface. You might be thinking that we’d already have to know the electric field to find such a surface, but we can use the symmetry of the problem to figure out the surface. I’m going to set my coordinate system so the line of charge goes in the z direction, which you can imagine going up and down. I’m also going to assume the charge is positive in all the diagrams (meaning the electric field points away), but if λ is negative, switch the direction of all the arrows in the diagram.Since the line of charge is infinitely long, it shouldn’t matter what section of the wire we look at. Each point on the wire will have the same amount of charge the same distance away on either side.This fact gives us two simplifications we can make:The wire has translational symmetry along its length, meaning the z component of the wire doesn’t matter and we can select any section of the wire to draw our surface.The electric field has a zero z component since the charge distribution is symmetric in the z direction around each point.This field is impossible because it has a positive z component.All possible fields have no z component.We can also notice that rotating around the line of charge doesn’t change the distribution of charge, so we also have rotational symmetry, meaning the electric field can’t look likePlotted using numpy and pyplot.where the red dot is the wire coming out of the screen. It also can’t look likebecause the magnetic field is constant (specifically, 0) and the Maxwell-Faraday equation means it doesn’t have any curl. At this point, the electric field can only look likewith the wire coming out of the screen. The length of the arrows will vary, but this is the correct direction.At this point, we now know we’re looking for a surface you can rotate around the wire or slide down the wire, which means we can use a cylinder centered around the wire as our surface. Gauss’s Law for us in this case is thereforeThe charge contained within a cylinder of length L is just Lλ, so there’s the right side of the equation solved. The total flux through the surface is the sum of the flux through both ends of the cylinder and the side of the cylinder (where you would put a label on a can). Plugging these in yieldsSince the electric field is perpendicular to bases of the cylinder (use the surface normals for flux), they contribute zero flux.Since the electric field points directly out of the side of the cylinder, the dot product in the integral just becomes a 2D integral, which is just the surface area of the side of a cylinder. At this point, we can get the answer with some algebra.With experience, you’ll recognize the cylindrical symmetry, at which point you’ll be able to go from Gauss’s Law to the math with little effort.Use Conserved QuantitiesAlthough you can use forces and torques to figure out how anything in Classical Mechanics will move and therefore figure out other related quantities, doing so can be a pain. If you’re trying to find out how fast a ball rolling down a straight ramp (without slipping and air resistance) is going at the bottom of the ramp, then you could use forces and torques even if they’re more work.All forces are the same throughout.If you’re trying to find out how fast a ball rolling down a curved ramp (without slipping and air resistance) is going at the bottom of the ramp using forces and torques, you will have to do a path integral of the force, which changes depending on the position, so good luck.AAAAAAHHHHHHHAt best, even if you get a solution, you’ll have spent way more time on a problem than you needed to. Instead, looking for conserved quantities can get you an answer you can check quickly. The three most common conserved quantities in Physics I problems areLinear Momentum: No net external forces on the system means the total linear momentum is conserved.Total Mechanical Energy: No air resistance, slipping, friction, or damage to the objects in the system likely means the total mechanical energy of the system is conserved. In more technical terms, if all the forces at every point form a conservative vector field, then energy is conserved. If the problem specifies an elastic collision, then total mechanical energy is also conserved.Angular Momentum: Something will be rotating and there will be no net external torques.If you can get either linear or angular momentum conserved, you get an equation for each relevant dimension. Likewise, if energy is conserved, you get one free equation, but that equation will often get you a lot more information for less effort.Example: Momentum and Energy ConservationAn astronaut in space knocks a ball at position (-1, -3) into another ball of equal mass at position (0, 0), which then goes on to hit the wall at position (2, 3). Before the collision, the first ball moves at velocity vi. What are the velocities of both balls immediately after the collision? Assume no friction, no air resistance, no gravity, and no rotation.Mechanical energy is conserved since the problem told us the collision was elastic, so that will get us an equation. We can also get some equations from momentum conservation since there are no external forces after the astronaut hits the first ball. We have three unknowns:v1, the velocity of the first ballv2, the velocity of the second ballthe direction of the first ball after the collisionWe know the direction the first ball went before the collision because it went from (-1, -3) to (0, 0). Similarly, we know the direction the second ball went because it went from (0, 0) to (2, 3). Next, we’ll normalize these vectors (dividing them by their length) so we end up with just the direction. We’ll put a ^ over these vectors so we’ll know they’re unit vectors.We went through the same process for v2 as we did for vi. Now that we have the unit vectors, we can express the vectors as the product of a magnitude and a direction.After this point, I’m going to keep everything in variables and I’m going to work with vectors because doing so will allow me to work on both the x and y dimensions at the same time because math is pretty useful. We’ll look at the momentum equation first.Now that we have an explicit equation for the v1, we can then look at the total mechanical energy equation. Note that since v1 is a vector, we can dot it with itself to get its magnitude squared, which is what we’ll need for the kinetic energy equation.Since the dot product between the hat vectors is a scalar (specifically the cosine of the angle between vi and v2), I’ll replace it with the symbol C to clean up the math.Now, we plug it into the total mechanical energy equation and we should end up with something we can solve.We reject the v2 = 0 solution because we know v2 is not zero, so we’re left with the other solution. We plug our result for v2 back into our equation for v1 and we’re done.Example: Energy ConservationA ball of mass m and radius R with a uniform density starts rolling down a ramp (not necessarily flat) with no air resistance, no slipping. The ball has an initial velocity vi before it reaches the ramp. The top of the ramp is h meters above the bottom of the ramp. How fast is the ball going when it reaches the bottom of the ramp?Sometimes, these problems have way more information about the ramp, but you won’t even need everything that I have given you in this problem. Since there’s neither air resistance nor slipping, we can use energy conservation. We have gravitational potential energy, translational kinetic energy (mass and velocity), and rotational kinetic energy (inertia and angular velocity) at both the start of the ramp and the bottom of the ramp. For reasons too complicated to get into here, only differences in potential energy matter, meaning we can arbitrarily say the potential energy at the bottom is 0 to make our math easier.Since it’s not slipping at any point, Rω = v at every point, meaning we have two more equations that relate the velocity and angular velocity: one at the start and one at the end. Lastly, we’ll need to know the moment of inertia for a sphere, which we can find either through direct integration or by looking it up.Plugging everything into the energy equation yieldsWe can cancel out the mass everywhere since it’s part of each term.We can also use the Rω = v substitution to reduce the number of variables to one unknown and three given variables. We can then solve for the final velocity. The entire process looks likeYou might be a little weirded out because you might think that the final velocity should depend on mass or the radius of the object, but it doesn’t. Remember that there is no air resistance in our situation and the only energy being added to the sphere comes from gravity, which provides a constant acceleration to all objects regardless of mass. Likewise, the larger radius means a higher moment of inertia, but since there is no slipping, the angular velocity, velocity, and radius are constrained in such a way that the rotational kinetic energy is independent of the radius.Finding a GeneralizationIf we let c be the ratio between the moment of inertia and the mass times the radius of rotation squared, we can come up with a general solutionIf the object had no moment of inertia or was unable to rotate (say a box sliding down a surface without friction), we would end up with the standard kinematic equationwhich should help you feel a little more confident about the solution.Know Your DerivativesThis technique has a slightly incorrect name, as Know the Fundamental Relationships Between Various Quantities would be more precise, but most of these relationships are defined in terms of derivatives (or equivalently integrals), so I decided to emphasize that part. All five of the kinematics equations can be derived from the fact that velocity is the time derivative of position, acceleration is the time derivative of velocity, and the assumption of constant acceleration. Other important Physics I relationships areForce is the time derivative of momentum and the negative gradient (a generic spacial derivative that can be expressed in different coordinate systems and any number of dimensions) of potential energy.Torque is the time derivative of angular momentum.Work in a non-rotating system is the path integral of force with respect to position.Work in a rotating system is the path integral of torque with respect to angular position.Don’t Plug Numbers in Until You Have toBecause I’ve been using this technique throughout all my examples, I won’t give an example of this guideline.Keeping everything in variables has several benefits:You can kind of tell if an answer makes sense by changing the given values to their logical extremes. For example, if the force of gravity goes up as you move away from a mass, you probably made an error somewhere.It’s much harder to find which specific step led to an error in a series of arithmetic operations than it is to find an error in a series of algebraic operations.Variables will often cancel out leaving you with a simpler equation and less work to do.As we did in the An Advanced Trick section, both examples in the Look at Each Dimension Individually section, and the Energy Conservation example, you can often find parts of the expression that you can convert into something you already know and reduce the amount of arithmetic you have to do.You can generalize this principle to things like not expanding everything out until you have to, such as not breaking things into individual dimensions until you have your equations, not expanding factored polynomials, etc. You should also look for simplifications you can make in the math, whether by factoring out variables, making the variables dimensionless, introducing constants, etc.Odds and EndsThese techniques or concepts are either too specific to get an entire section or don’t need a full explanation, so I’m going to list them off here.Tension is a transfer of force from one side of a rope/chain to the other, so you can add up all the forces on one side of the rope, get its magnitude, add up all the forces on the other side of the rope, get its magnitude, and then find the difference to find the net force.Waves, fluid flow/pressure, and oscillatory motion like pendula (neuter plurals end in ‘a’ in Latin), springs, and orbits at the Physics I level are described with algebraic equations, but they become differential equations in later classes. For now, stick with the algebra versions.Physics is mostly math with a few specific facts and equations as a base. Learning math will give you new methods, shortcuts, and a deeper understanding of physics. For basic physics (momentum, energy, forces, torques, etc.), I suggest learning some basic linear algebra (vectors, dot products, and cross products), trigonometry, and single variable calculus. For basic electromagnetism, I suggest learning multivariable calculus (usually Calculus III in the US). For anything after that, I suggest learning ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations.Be consistent. If you decide that the positive y axis will point down, then gravity will provide a positive acceleration. If you decide that W is the work done on a system, then U = Q+W. In general, once you decide the setup, you can do the math without thinking too hard and interpret the results based on your set up.Angular KinematicsAngular quantities were my least favorite parts of Physics I because their problems were linear problems with a few more steps or equations tacked on, so I’ve avoided using problems with angular quantities as examples to keep this article from being too long.All the angular kinematic quantities (angular distance, angular speed, and angular acceleration) are the normal linear quantities divided by r, or the distance away from the axis of rotation, and they have the same kinematic equations.Angular momentum, angular velocity, and torque are all vectors (pseudovectors are still elements of a vector space) whose direction is the axis of rotation, so you can do things like add them together and separate them into separate dimensions.In dealing with torque problems, if you don’t know the forces at a point, try finding the torque around that point since the unknown forces will contribute zero torque. For example, a ladder leaning against a wall will exert a force on the wall, but you probably won’t be able to figure out that force without solving the entire problem, so find the torque at the point where the ladder touches the wall.Where to Go from HereFigure out what works for you, what doesn’t work for you, what works for others, and the reasons behind all three. If something works for someone else but not you, see if it would be worth it to make it work for you and consider what you would have to do to make it work for you. For example, I tend to use more powerful math because doing so allows me to set up the problem and let the math do the work for me, and you might benefit from that approach.Though I can give you what I know, the best techniques and guidelines are the ones you forge on your own through your mistakes, efforts, and achievements. If you want to do well in physics, take what I have given you and make it your own.AfterthoughtsIf you have learned or been learning physics, please leave any techniques and guidelines that worked for you in the comments below.I’m considering making a series of articles with a similar format and style for other subjects, so if you liked this article, stay tuned.DisclaimerI wrote all the example problems based on the techniques and guidelines described. Some examples are based off well known problems, such as the range of a ballistic projectile and the object hanging from a string in an accelerating vehicle, or they are so simple that it is likely that someone else has written a similar problem, such the example given in the section Move Forward on Any Front, No Matter How Small.I made all images using LaTeX, tikz, and GIMP.Cantor’s ParadiseMedium’s #1 Math Publication!Follow313 1 PhysicsLearningStudentsEducation313 claps313 claps1 responseWritten byJoseph MellorFollowCurrently an Undergrad Student Majoring in Physics, Computer Science, and Math with a Minor in High Performance Computing.

How Newton’s First Law of Motion Can Help You Get Things Done Faster,https://medium.com/kaizen-habits/how-newtons-first-law-of-motion-can-help-you-get-things-done-faster-8edcd8ac7f91?source=tag_archive---------2-----------------------,"Work,Productivity,Careers,Self,Physics","Illustration: Marco BagniIn 1687, Sir Isaac Newton, one of the greatest mathematicians and physicists in history, published his groundbreaking book, Principia: Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy.In his book (widely considered to be one of the most important scientific books ever written) Newton laid out his mathematical principles relating to natural philosophy and his system of the world. His first law of motion can be a helpful model to make progress in your life and career.Also referred to as the law of inertia, Newton’s first law of motion states that an object at rest remains at rest, or if in motion, remains in motion at a constant velocity unless acted on by a net external force.Newton’s Law of motion may seem irrelevant to productivity but it can have a real impact on your productivity.Applying the Laws of Motion to ProductivityWhen you choose not to do real work or procrastinate, you’re at rest. You are not moving the needle or making progress. You experience the pull of the first law firsthand — objects at rest tend to stay at rest.Until and unless you make up your mind and take action to get things done, you will continue to remain at rest.But when you start taking action or getting your most important things done, you enter in a state of motion: crossing tasks off your to-do list and getting closer to your goals — objects in motion tend to stay in motion.Starting important work, task or project is sometimes the most difficult action for many of us. Taking the first step is one of the biggest hurdles to even build better habits.To achieve anything worthwhile, you have to be in motion — if you don’t take action and are not proactive, nothing will happen. You will remain in the state of rest.Newton’s Law of motion represents work in progress. To get more things done, don’t lose momentum.You can only make real progress if you are in a constant state of motion — defining your goals, identifying the change you want to make in your life, defining the actions you need to take and consistently applying the law of momentum by starting small.Based on Newton’s first law, to be productive, you have to start moving, going through the initial motions of completing a task. You need to be able to take the first steps that lead to completing a task.Tasks in motion tend to get done. So just start. Get your ideas down to a small, immediately executable step and start getting them done — find a way to start small.Remember, objects in motion tend to stay in motion.“When it comes to being productive, this means one thing: the most important thing is to find a way to get started. Once you get started, it is much easier to stay in motion,” writes James Clear.You stop being productive when an external or internal force (distractions and the decision to respond to the interruption) stop you from getting things done. Hence, ‘an object remains in motion unless an external force stops the object in motion’.If you’re at rest, you’re likely to stay that way unless you proactivitely decide to start the initial motion of getting real work done. If you’re continually in motion, you’re likely to stay that way, too, until you are distracted.Based on Newton’s first law of motion, productivity is determined by the willingness to work, move and act. So to be productive, just start moving towards accomplishing your goals and be aware of your productivity.Whether it's getting more work done, achieving your goals or improving your life and career, Newton’s first of law of motion can help you make real progress every day.You can apply it in any area of your life where you’d like to make progress. Get moving, and you’ll keep going. Use Newton’s first laws of motion to your advantage.Join my personal newsletter (tools for personal and career growth) and get a free ebook “Habit Stacking: Deeper Essays on Personal Growth, Productivity and Happiness”.Written byThomas OppongFounder @AllTopStartups | Featured at Forbes, Business Insider, etc. | Join my personal newsletter for life and career tools at https://postanly.substack.comFollow664 4 Sign up for CuriouslyBy Kaizen HabitsScience-based answers and insights for productivity, wealth, health and happiness Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

A Simple Model for the Handstand,https://medium.com/@abrown18_68137/a-simple-model-for-the-handstand-1c775286c3bf?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"Physics,Handstand,Torque","IntroductionThe physics experience of Amelia Brown, and the curiosity and project management of Erica Dohring brought two strangers together to answer the question: what is the minimum angle that an individual can execute a handstand at? In other words, if θ is defined as the angle created when moving from the hands to the wrists to the arms, what is the minimum angle possible when maintaining a handstand before falling over? If we define 90° to be when your body is straight up and down, on average, the minimum possible angle is only about 87°!This question can be re-framed into a tipping point problem. The most simplified answer is that, if you treat both the body and hands as rods, the tipping point of a handstand is 90°. This is due to the fact that the only force acting on the body is the force of gravity, and once the body tilts further than this halfway point it will fall.However, our body is not truly static when we attempt handstands. The muscles in our hands, wrists, and forearms are constantly engaged and provide counter forces that allow us to maintain handstands at angles greater than or less than 90°. What limits the range of angles is an individual’s physical limitation when extending their wrists (bending away from the body), and one’s capacity to exert enough force to maintain that position. The following analysis will estimate that amount of force required to maintain a handstand at various angles.TorqueAn appropriate approach to solve this problem is to balance the torques acting on the body. When two or more torques act on a singular object and entirely balance each other out, then the object will not rotate. Torque is different from force because it considers both the force and the distance from the axis of rotation that the force occurs. Before tackling a torque analysis of a handstand, let’s first examine the analogous yet more familiar behavior of a door on a hinge. [Figure 1]Figure 1 By using a model of a door, we are able to visualize how each of the elements of the torque equation are defined before delving into a more complicated torque analysis for handstands.The equation for torque is τ=rFsinθLet’s break down each of these terms — as we will be considering each of them in our analysis.r = the distance between the axis of rotation and the point where the force is actingF = the magnitude (size) of the force that is applied to the objectθF = the angle that is created when moving from the axis of rotation to the point where the force acts and then following the direction of forceWhile doing a handstand, the wrists act as an axis of rotation, therefore a torque-based analysis is appropriate. Putting all of this together, we can now analyze the torques acting on the body. The first, and least complicated of the torques is the torque due to the force of gravity on the body.Torque due to gravityTransitioning from the model of the door to the model of the human body is not a huge leap. The doorway (black region in Figure 1) is analogous to an individual’s hands, where the door itself (brown region in Figure 1) is analogous to an individual’s body. In order to differentiate between the hands and the rest of the body, the hands will be referred to as ‘hands’ and the remainder of the body will be referred to as the ‘body’. From now on, the analysis will focus on the forces acting on the body, and how the torques due to the forces on the body come to balance.Figure 2 This figure displays how each of the elements of the torque equation are oriented with respect to the hand, wrist and arm. The torque elements considered in this case are all due to the force of gravity.Here is our equation for the torque due to gravity: τg = r(Fg)sin(θg)What is r?Another way to phrase this question is: how far from the axis of rotation does gravity act?In reality, gravity acts on every bit of the body. However, any object or system of objects can be simplified to a singular point of mass known as the center of mass (COM). The COM essentially averages the position, concentration and value of the mass in every part of the system. We can utilize this information to simplify where gravity acts on the body to a singular location.Countless studies and high school physics labs have been conducted to measure the COM of a human being, which means that there is plenty of information on the internet which we can pull from. However, it is important to remember that these cases are almost always calculated while the individual’s arms are by their sides. A handstand requires an individual’s arms to be above their head which redistributes the mass of the body. A simple mathematical adjustment can be done to correct this inconsistency. [Figure 3] If we are considering the COM to be the position where gravity acts on the body, then the value for r, is the distance between the axis of rotation and the newly calculated COM of the individual. The specific expression used to calculate an individual’s COM can be found in Table 1.Figure 3 Normally, the COM of a human body is measured when an individual’s arms are down by their side. When an individual’s arms are raised above the head, the conventional COM of the human body is shifted upwards. By approximating the locations of the COM for the arms and the body separately, a new COM can be calculated by using the COM equation.Table 1 By using average body segment mass percentages, COMs specific to the sex of the individual, and the final equation which was derived in Figure 3, a new COM was calculated and represented in the above table. The body segment mass percentage of an arm was from de Leva et al., 1996, and the standard LCOM was taken from https://hypertextbook.com/facts/2006/centerofmass.shtml.What is Fg?Fg is the magnitude of the force of gravity. An equation that may be found in the echoes of your high school physics class is F=ma. The force of gravity is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity: 9.8 m/s². The mass of the human body is simply the value that you read when you step on a scale.What is θg?If you recall from before, we previously defined θF as “the angle that is created when moving from the axis of rotation to the point where the force acts and then following the direction of force”. From this definition, our θg will be defined as 90°- θ. [Figure 2] This analysis aims to calculate the amount of force required to maintain a handstand at various angles. Therefore, the variable θ will remain unknown at the moment.As proposed at the beginning of the article, the tipping point for a handstand is 90° because this is the only angle where the body can stay upright — assuming complete rigidity and no forces due to active muscles in the wrists to balance.Figure 4 A schematic to represent the torque due to the force of gravity on the body while attempting a 90° handstand. The Fg force vector is antiparallel to the r vector, therefore θg = 0°.To check that our analysis is correct, this assumption can be verified in our torque equation for gravity: τ = rFgsinθg = rFgsin(90°- θ) = rFgsin(0) = 0. At θ = 90°, there is no torque acting on the object, as expected. Therefore the body theoretically will not fall due to gravity if it is at 90°. When the body exceeds or falls short of this tipping point, the torque equation becomes non-zero in value, requiring other forces to hold the body up: enter the hand and wrist muscles. Next we will calculate the torques provided by these muscles to counter the torque of gravity at various angles.AnatomyWhile inverted in a handstand, several small adjustments are required in order to stay balanced. What enables us to make these small adjustments are the multitude of complex muscles, tendons, and bones in our hands and wrists. This complexity does prove to be difficult, however, when analyzing the torque due to the hands and wrists. In an effort to simplify the problem, all of the hand muscles were condensed into two different groups: the muscles that cause forces near the fingers and the muscles that cause forces closer to the wrists. See Figure 5 for more details.Figure 5 The blue lines represent the outline of the hand/wrist/arm region. The muscles were sorted into one of two groups, digitorum or carpi, based on their approximate termination and insertion points. This figure displays the simplified path that the two groups of muscles tend to follow, as well as the list of muscles that make up each group.Here are the assumptions that were made:The muscles can be separated into two groups: “digitorum” and “carpi”. The names do not restrict the types of muscles included in the groups, they simply reflect the classification of the majority of the muscles in each group.The “digitorum” group includes the muscles: flexor digitorum superficialis, extensor digitorum, flexor digitorum profundus, and flexor pollicis longus.The “carpi” group includes the muscles: extensor carpi, radialis longus, extensor carpi radialis brevis, flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus, flexor carpi ulnaris, and extensor carpi ulnaris.The digitorum group contains muscles that on average originate (start) halfway up the arm, and insert (end) 6/7 of the way down the hand.The carpi group contains muscles that on average originate halfway up the arm, and insert 1/4 of the way down the hand.Before proceeding with the details of the torque equations, I will propose a model that will help us to decide what values each of our variables will represent.As mentioned above in the introduction to torque, it is the individual’s body that experiences the balancing of torques and rotates around the axis of rotation located at the wrist. This model proves to be slightly problematic for several reasons. One particular reason is because the hand muscles originate in the arm (part of the body), yet insert in the hands (not part of the body). Part of the stabilizing force that we want to solve for is not part of the body. This calls for a simplified and approximated model for how the forces work in this situation. In reality, the muscles that travel down your arm and into your hands prevent any unwanted movement by contracting. An equivalent model can be created which treats the forces from the muscles as support structures that are positioned along the imaginary line travelling from the point of termination in the hand to the point of origin in the arm. The reason for this rearrangement is to simplify the behavior of the forces to act at only one location on the body. See Figure 6 for details.Figure 6 Presented with the problem that the forces due to hand and wrist muscles act within both the hands and the body, a new model must be developed in order to continue using our general torque expression of rFsinθ. The proposed model pictured in this figure treats the displacement vector (line between the start and end) of the muscle paths as a sort of support structure that will prop up the arm. This model will allow for a singular force to be analyzed at the top of the theoretical support structures for each muscle group. The forces are represented by the dark red and green arrows in the figure above.Torque due to the force of musclesHere is our equation for the torque due to the force of muscles: τ = rFsin(θF)What is r?As defined above, r is the distance between the axis of rotation and the point where the force is acting. In the proposed model above, the re-oriented force acts upward originating from a point halfway up the arm. Therefore, for both groups of muscles, r=1/2 Larm.What is F?The values for the force due to the digitorum muscle group (Fd) and the carpi muscle group (Fc) are the values that we are looking to solve for in this analysis. Therefore, Fd and Fc are our two unknowns.What is θF?θF is the angle created while travelling up r and across F. The digitorum and carpi forces will always point in different directions, so a θF will need to be calculated for each of the two forces.The value of θF will be calculated using trigonometry and will depend on θ. In fact, three different trigonometric situations need to be evaluated for each θF. The first situation is where the wrist creates a 90° angle. [Figure 7] The second and third situations depend on a new variable called θR.We will define θR as the angle that the wrist makes such that the elbow is directly above the termination point of the muscle in the hand. [Figure 8] The value of θR is dependent only on the dimensions of an individual’s arm and where the muscle group inserts in the hand. Therefore the value of θR will vary depending on which muscle group you are analyzing. Once the value for θR is calculated, the second trigonometric situation will be analyzed for cases when θ is greater than or equal to θR and the third situation will be analyzed for cases when θ is less than θR. [Figure 9, Figure 10] In order to visualize the three situations see the diagrams below:Figure 7 One trigonometric situation that can arise when attempting a handstand, is that the arms and wrist create a 90° angle. Pictured above are calculations for the angle θF in this particular situation, where the value of this calculated angle depends on the individual’s measurements for Larm and the insertion point for each muscle group.Figure 8 The angle between the hands and wrists that allows for the insertion point of the muscle group to be directly above the origin point of the muscle group, is defined as θR. The angle θR is important to calculate because it marks the angle at which the trigonometry needed to solve for θF changes. The value for θR will depend on the individual’s measurements for Larm and the insertion point for each muscle group.Figure 9 The second trigonometric situation that can arise when attempting a handstand, is that the arms and wrist create an angle, θ, greater than or equal to θR. Pictured above are calculations for the angle θF in this particular situation, where the value of this calculated angle depends on θ as well as the individual’s measurements for Larm and the insertion point for each muscle group.Figure 10 The third trigonometric situation that can arise when attempting a handstand, is that the arms and wrist create an angle, θ, less than θR. Pictured above are calculations for the angle θF in this particular situation, where the value of this calculated angle depends on θ as well as the individual’s measurements for Larm and the insertion point for each muscle group.Final torque equationIn order for the body to remain stationary in a handstand, all of the torques must balance. Therefore, the torque due to gravity must equal the sum of the torques due to Fd and Fc. Our final equation is as follows:τg= τd + τcLCOMmgsin(90°-θ) = ½ LarmFdsin(θFd)+ ½ LarmFc(θFc)The values for θFd and θFc can be evaluated for different values of θ depending on how it relates to θRd and θRc as specified in Figures 7–10. This equation has two unknown variables in it: Fd and Fc, so we need one more equation that relates the two.Data CollectionTo determine how the two forces relate, two force plates were acquired and several days were spent doing handstands. The two force plates were placed side-by-side and aligned so that while inverted, the region of the knuckles to the tips of the fingers of each hand was on the front plate while the region of the knuckles to the wrists of each hand was on the back plate. The force plates recorded weight throughout the trials, therefore the positioning of the hands allowed for the front plate to read the weight distribution in the front half of the hands while the back plate read the weight distribution in the remaining half of the hands.The handstands were executed in front of a wall in order to gain support when falling over the natural tipping point, and then attempts were made to controllably leave the wall and maintain several angles around 90°. This method only allowed for short periods of steady inversion (~1–2 seconds), but it was essential to collect data where the body was suspended only by the muscles in the hand and gravity — not by the wall. Additionally, several trials were needed in order to stay entirely rigid and linear. It takes practice to not arch one’s back and maintain a tight form in an attempt to reach angles less than 90°.From the data, an approximate relationship arose where 40% of the weight distribution fell on the front plate, while the remaining 60% of the weight distribution fell on the back plate. An approximate correlation was made which assumed that 40% of the force was therefore exerted by the digitorum group of muscles and 60% of the force was exerted by the carpi group of muscles. This approximation will fall apart for angles that stray far from 90°, but only angles close to 90° will be needed for a reasonable handstand analysis. From this information, a second equation of Fd=4Fc/6 can be used to solve for the value of each force at different values of θ.ResultsAfter the data collection, the final system of equations is complete and ready for use in calculating values of force in the carpi and digitorum muscle groups.LCOMmgsin(90°- θ) = ½ LarmFcsin(θFc)+ ½ LarmFd(θFd)Fd=4Fc/6A computer program was composed to allow for the streamlining of the calculation process, as the values for θFc and θFd require the user to evaluate whether the angle of the handstand is equal to 90°, or greater than, less than, or equal to the values of θRc and θRd.The first set of dimensions used to calculate the values of Fc and Fd are presented in Table 2. These dimensions represent the dimensions of an average female in the United States. The calculations for Fc and Fd were executed for values of θ between 90° and 80°. The results of the calculation can be found in Table 3. The calculations were repeated with the average male dimensions from the United States (Table 4) and the results can be found in Table 5. The values for forces presented in Table 3 and Table 5 demonstrate that to maintain an 85° handstand, the average American would need to exert 40–70 lbf (F) or 50–80 lbf (M) for each muscle group. To maintain a handstand just 5° lower, where θ = 80°, the amount of force required doubles. Approximately 100 lbf is needed for the average female body and up to 160 lbf is needed for the average male body (depending on the muscle group).In order to contextualize how much force is required by the hands, Table 6 lists the amount of gravitational force (weight) that acts on the average female and an average male as well as a force measurement of average palmar pinch strength. By 80°, both sets of data stipulate that the amount of force required by each group of muscles is equivalent to a significant percentage of that person’s weight. In the case of the average female, the carpi group alone requires a force equivalent to 84% of the individual’s weight. [Table 3] Similarly, in the case of the average male, at 80°, the carpi group requires a force equivalent to 83% of the average male weight. [Table 5] When comparing this to palmar pinch strength, the carpi muscle group in the average female data set exceeds the average palmar pinch strength by the angle of θ = 86°, while the digitorum group reaches this limit at the angle of θ = 85°. [Table 3] In the case of the average male, the average palmar pinch strength is exceeded at the angle of θ = 87° for the carpi muscle group and at θ = 85° for the digitorum muscle group. [Table 5]In conclusion, these results demonstrate how much force is required to maintain a handstand at even 10° beyond the natural tipping point of θ = 90°. However, the data also shows how realistically, the average palm is unable to sustain enough force to tilt beyond even 3° or 4° of the θ = 90° mark.Tables 7–11 present calculations for Fc and Fd where the dimensions for the average female were further adjusted to see how changing one variable affects the amount of force required. Table 7 demonstrates that a 30% decrease in height results in a 30% decrease in force required to maintain a handstand at a particular angle. Similarly, Table 8 demonstrates that a 30% increase in weight results in a 30% increase in force required to maintain a handstand at a particular angle. From the approximated analysis laid out for this project, these results point to a direct relationship between both the height and weight of an individual and the force required to stay upright.A less direct relationship can be seen in Table 9, Table 10, and Table 11 where the values for Lhand, Larm, and LCOM were adjusted. In Table 9, an increase in Lhand by 30% led to a 20% decrease in force required to maintain a handstand. In Table 10, a 30% decrease in arm length caused less than 10% increase in force required. In Table 11, the LCOM that was used reflected that of the average male COM instead of the average female COM. The average male COM is shifted more towards the shoulders whereas the average female COM tends to shift more towards the hips. While inverted, this means that the male COM is closer to the ground than the average female COM. The calculations demonstrate that the closer an individual’s COM is to the ground (when inverted), the less force is required to maintain a handstand at various angles.The results in Tables 7–11 indicate that individuals who are shorter, lighter, have longer hands and arms, and have a more cranial COM will require the least amount of force to maintain a handstand from both the carpi and digitorum muscle groups.Table 2 The above values represent the average female dimensions.

Note that LCOM is calculated assuming that measurements will be made from the ground up while the individual is inverted.Table 3 Using the values from Table 2, the amount of force needed from the digitorum and carpi muscle groups was calculated for values of θ ranging from 90° to 80°.Table 4 The above values represent the average male dimensions.

The value for average palmar strength came from Table 5 of Grip and Pinch Strength: Normative data for adults by Virgil Mathiowetz et. al.Table 7 The amount of force needed from the digitorum and carpi muscle groups was calculated for values of θ ranging from 90° to 80° using the values from Table 2, except that the value for height is decreased by 30%.Table 8 The amount of force needed from the digitorum and carpi muscle groups was calculated for values of θ ranging from 90° to 80° using the values from Table 2, except that the value for weight is increased by 30%.Table 9 The amount of force needed from the digitorum and carpi muscle groups was calculated for values of θ ranging from 90° to 80° using the values from Table 2, except that the value for Lhand is increased by 30%.Table 10 The amount of force needed from the digitorum and carpi muscle groups was calculated for values of θ ranging from 90° to 80° using the values from Table 2, except that the value for Larm is decreased by 30%.Table 11 The amount of force needed from the digitorum and carpi muscle groups was calculated for values of θ ranging from 90° to 80° using the values from Table 2, except that LCOM is calculated using the average male expression of .405L instead of the average female expression of .420L. (see Table 1)Further AnalysisIn reality, the body is not a rigid system. Muscle groups other than hand and wrist muscles must be engaged in order to maintain a rigid shape. For example, three other main axes of rotation in our body are the shoulders, back, and hips. The main muscle groups acting at these axes are the shoulder muscles, the muscles of the abdomen, and the muscles in the butt and thighs. Previous analysis has demonstrated that when executing a handstand at angles greater or less than 90°, the force of gravity exerts torque and will cause the body to rotate around an axis of rotation. The process of maintaining a handstand requires forces by the muscle groups mentioned above in order to prevent the remainder of the body from rotating about the shoulders, back, and hips and ultimately falling over due to gravity.In order to approximate the amount of force needed for these specific muscle groups, all forces due to each of these muscular regions are assumed to act perpendicular to the body. This means that the angle between r and Fmuscle will always be 90°, and the sinθ term will simplify to 1. Further approximations can be found in Figure 11.Using the dimensions from Table 2, as well as the force expressions from the bottom row of Figure 11, values for each of the forces due to the shoulders, abs, and butt/thighs were calculated and can be found in Table 12. The results of the calculations show that the shoulder muscles require forces that exceed those required by the hand and wrist muscles by almost 10%. The combination of both the digitorum and carpi muscle groups as well as the shoulder, abs, and butt/thigh muscles reaffirm the fact that a strenuous amount of force is required from several muscle groups in one’s body to maintain a handstand even just a few degrees beyond the θ = 90° benchmark.Figure 11 The shoulders, back, and hips all present axes of rotation where the body can easily compensate rigidity. The diagrams pictured, as well as the table of values below, specify the locations of the axis of rotation, the force due to the muscles in the area, the COM, and the relative magnitude of the force of gravity on the remaining body. The final expression for the force required by the corresponding muscles can be found in the last row of the table. The values used to determine the mass of the arms, head, legs, and feet were from the body segment data from de Leva et al. 1996.Table 12 The amount of force needed from the shoulder, abdominal, and butt/thigh muscle groups was calculated for values of θ ranging from 90° to 80° using the values from Table 2.Final ThoughtsAs demonstrated by the data in Tables 3, 5, and 7–11, the forces required to maintain a handstand increase significantly for every degree that one strays from 90°. For an individual with the average dimensions used in this analysis, by 80° your wrist, hand, and shoulder muscles are each exerting forces equal to a significant fraction of the magnitude of your weight. Not to mention that by the first few degrees, the forces required by the hand and wrist muscles exceed the average values for palmar pinch strength. So, what is the maximum possible angle of a handstand? Using the palmar pinch strength as a limiting factor: about 87°. This number can and will change depending on how strong your wrists, shoulders, abs, and thighs are. Hopefully, the data collected from this analysis can help contextualize the answer to this question for your own dimensions and abilities.How does this information help to increase the quality of your handstands? This analysis asserts that once you figure out how to get up there in the first place, the best way to prepare for maintaining a handstand is strengthening all of your muscles — especially your wrists. This will help so that when you inevitably waver from the ideal angle of 90°, you will have the strength not only to maintain a handstand, but to correct yourself back to the less-strenuous angle of 90°.This process of analysis was done with several physics-related approximations, seriously oversimplified biomechanics models, and less than desirable gymnastics skills. Therefore, when it comes to analyzing the results of the calculations, please keep these things in mind. Hopefully, this model will be further developed by many others: including but not limited to those who are interested in collecting more data, improving the biomechanical and physical models, or putting their talents in gymnastics to another good use.August 15, 2020After publishing this article, Chris Gatti reached out to make us aware of a similarly titled article of his titled “A Simple Model of the Handstand”, linked here if you are interested in further analysis.Written byAmelia BrownFollow41 41 41 PhysicsHandstandTorqueMore from Amelia BrownFollowMore From MediumClosing in on cancerThe EconomistDiscovering DNA: the Farm Boy and the GrasshoppersScienceDuuude in Exploring HistoryI’m a Scientist.

"Physics Envy Doesn’t Bite, But It Stings",https://medium.com/@renuka.p.bhat/physics-envy-doesnt-bite-but-it-stings-4325e811ff18?source=tag_archive---------4-----------------------,"Physics,Economics,Neoclassical Economics","The term “physics envy” conjures an amusing image of an economist lying on a reclining lounge, talking his heart out to everyone’s favourite psychoanalyst. Physics has sneaked its way into Economics and Finance from the Brownian Motion assumption for the Black- Scholes Option Pricing Model to the Gravity Model of International Trade in International Economics. Economics has always been struggling to find its place in the Sciences, (even being proposed to replace Engineering as the ‘E’ in STEM). Too mathematical with its complex statistical and econometric tools, yet not as succinct as the models in Physics. The dilemma is unsurprising.Yet, as ambitious as modern economics tends to be, it often forgets the humble origins of Adam Smith’s seminal work, to be in moral philosophy. Economics was proposed as an ethical and social exercise. It sat on the shelves with the likes of Machiavelli, Moore and Locke. There is little cause for astonishment in that, either — philosophical musings birthed the art of statecraft and policy. Macroeconomics developed as an offshoot of the same (perhaps, you can call it the second cousin you occasionally chit-chat with at parties). The idea seems counter-intuitive as most Econ 101 classes begin with the microeconomic fundamentals and how these concepts are further applied to explain macroeconomic phenomena. That has a lot to do with the state of modern economic education. Alfred Marshall, the architect of the Marginalist Revolution, which shaped modern economics, was greatly responsible for the mathematicisation of economics. As the name suggests, this school of thought focused on the marginal productivity, marginal cost and marginal utility for devising precise points of equilibrium in the goods as well as labour markets.Thomas Kuhn’s model on ‘Paradigm’ in science, can perhaps, shed better light on the evolution of modern economics. Kuhn mentions four stages of development in a Science: Pre-Science, Normal Science, Crisis and Revolution. In terms of economics, the moral philosophy stage can be seen as the Pre-Scientific stage, where the discipline was in disarray. Smith’s ‘Wealth of Nations’ onwards, economics saw a structure, prominently with the works of David Ricardo. It could be called a Normal Science, but its focus was still more on the theoretical aspects of political theory and moral philosophy. Since multiple schools of thought have co-existed in the economic discipline, there is little to say which crisis in particular deserves the qualification. Marshall’s Marginalist Revolution, is indeed the fourth stage which caused the ‘Paradigm shift’ to neo-classical economics.The Neo-classical school of thought took Marshall’s theories further, stating that equilibrium can be achieved by the laws of supply and demand, with the underlying assumption of free markets and rational market players who maximizes their individual utility on the basis of their utility functions. Together with Keynesian economics, it forms the Neo-classical synthesis, the most widely known (and taught) system of economics globally. There are some obvious lacunae in this system: neither individuals nor firms can adequately and unbiasedly condense their needs into a simple, differentiable utility function. They may not always be consistent, utility-maximising, rational individuals — also known as the mythical Homo Economicus. On an economy-wide level, markets are seldom free, with zero government intervention and perfect competition cannot possibly exist. Here, the standard response from neo-classical defenders is a mimicry of physics. Quite like the latter, the idea is to begin with an ideal scenario (or no attrition, in physical terms) and then relax the assumptions steadily to come up with a realistic model. Yet, it’s easier to mathematically account for friction or air resistance on a frictionless surface than to check for the interaction of policy variables in an imperfect market. Objects in physics exist in vacuum, the economy does not.In the 1930’s at the height of the neo-classical frenzy, the British Economist, Lionel Robbins claimed that the basic tenets of economics were based on ‘deduction from simple assumptions reflecting very elementary facts of general experience’, and as were ‘as universal as the laws of mathematics or mechanics, and as little capable of “suspension”’. Although its popularity died down post the second world war, with the rise of Keynesianism, the 1970s heralded a resurgence (owing to failed Keynesian policies in the US stagflation).Nobel laureate Wassily Leontief used the term “physics envy” for the growing economic scientism that grew in the following decades. Oblivious of its consequences, economists and political theorists alike placed their bets on the mathematical neo-classical models in the 1990’s. Even academic institutions like the American Journal of Political Science refused to review submissions that lacked tested theoretical models. Yet, did it do any good? Bill Clinton’s prized welfare reform act, aimed at “ending poverty as we know it” only increased the number of those in deep poverty. Alan Greenspan’s confidence in the neo- classical system only contributed to the gigantic housing price bubble which eventually burst in 2008. The list goes on.On a more fundamental level, the most common critique of modern economics is due to heavy capitalist influence. While maximizing at the margin, the system does not account for the unpredictability and the sentiments of the individuals it is based upon. In a battle between equity and efficiency, equity sees itself on the losing side, for the fear of unwelcome ‘market distortions’. A common example is the case against universal basic income: by mandating a wage floor, the system becomes inefficient, creating further unemployment in the economy. This is precisely why Marxists call modern economics “vulgar”, and without sounding too radical, there is certainly, some merit to it.As Cambridge’s political economist John Rapley quips in his Aeon piece, more people are likely to have an opinion (and a strong one at that) on the income inequality between athletes and laypeople than the relevance of string theory, much to the annoyance of economists. Yet, it is only indicative of the impact the discipline has on everyone’s lives. Despite previous attempts being made in the past to delink economics from law, political science, sociology and even psychology, its elementary human factor prevents it from existing in isolation — in vacuum. Paradoxically, in its pursuit of precision, modern economics became too perfectly flawed. It is up to the policymakers to decide which flaws to overlook and which ones to correct, in their age-old battle of equity versus efficiency.References:Clarke, K., & Primo, D. (2020).

Buddhist Ontology,https://medium.com/@anand.murugan/buddhist-ontology-4dee87861675?source=tag_archive---------5-----------------------,"Philosophy,Buddhism,Spirituality,Physics,Science","Ontology is the branch of western philosophy that deals with the nature of being. What is? Western science has answers to this question that suggest the world is made of material particles or atoms. These are supposedly units of matter that build up the material world.In my opinion, this view is spiritually misleading. It confuses us about the nature of our own body, our consciousness and the world we live in. Buddhist philosophy has a different approach to ontology. The core idea of Buddhist philosophy is interdependent origination — pratityasamutpada in Sanskrit. The idea is that all phenomena are made of other phenomena. Phenomena here could mean your body, a tree or an idea.A tree is made of sunshine, the soil, water, air, etc. A tree is only made of non-tree elements. Therefore a tree is empty of independent existence or independent self nature — svabhava in Sanskrit. This is the Buddhist concept of emptiness — sunyata in Sanskrit.In the Heart Sutra, the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara states ‘Form is Emptiness, Emptiness is Form’. Thich Nhat Hanh emphasizes that Emptiness does not mean Nothingness. The form is there, but it is empty of a separate self. A form cannot be — it can only interbe.In my opinion, one of the main stumbling blocks to understanding the Buddhist approach to ontology for a western-educated mind is the notion of time. The western notion of being is intimately tied up with the notion of time. A tree or a human being is born, lives for a certain period of time and then dies. The western mind thus attributes the notion of being to the period that the tree is alive and non-being to the periods when it is not alive.But the reality is that the nature of our consciousness transcends such a linear notion of time. Linear time is an artificial construct and confuses us about the true nature of reality. Grounding the notion of being on such an artificial construct leads to misunderstanding.Written byAnand MuruganFollow4 4 4 PhilosophyBuddhismSpiritualityPhysicsScienceMore from Anand MuruganFollowMore From MediumVoice LessonsC.

Tawaf: A Lesson in Centripetal Acceleration?,https://medium.com/scratching-at-the-infinity-of-the-quran/tawaf-a-lesson-in-centripetal-acceleration-de35ccda3c3c?source=tag_archive---------6-----------------------,"Physics,Mecca,Circle Of Life,Islam,Hajj","The repentance (tawbah) accepted by Allah is only for those who do wrong in ignorance [or carelessness] and then repent soon after. It is those to whom Allah will turn in forgiveness, and Allah is ever Knowing and Wise. (Surah An-Nisa [4]:17 Quran)With the passing of the 10 days of Dhul-Hijjah, the holiest 10 days of the Islamic calendar, few images flood the lands of social media as those of the Hajj, which is performed annually during those 10 days. Of those images, none are more staggering than the swarms of humanity that gather to circle the Kabah in the ritual known as the tawaf.Each rite of the hajj is pregnant with rich spirtual symbolism. That of the tawaf is perhaps the most easibly deducible: to revel with God we must revolve around Him; we must circumscribe our actions around His Remembrance and Decree.From the perspective of geometry, it is worth considering the “circle” in the circling we do. In many traditonal religions, circles have represented the Divine and infinity. Sikhs, to give a quick example, wear the kara, a circular steel bangle around their wrists. The circle is perfectly conitnuous and smooth, bearing no distinct edges or protrusions. At all angles, it appears the same and symmetrical; it appears to be one. Unsurprisingly, Islamic architecture is built upon cicular patterns and geometry (pun intended).*Having recently taken physics 101, I could not help but recall our unit on ciruclar motion. “We” learned a lot of things (I don’t dare say ‘I’), but what immediately comes to mind is “centripetal accelration” (or centrifugal, for all you Brits/Desis). According to this principle, in order for a physcial body to travel in a perfect circular path, it must constantly change its direction at every single instant with respect to the center. It must be constantly turning…Perhaps not coincidentally the word for repentance in the Islamic voabulary is tawbah, which literally means “to turn.” When we sin, we turn away from Allah. To be bestowed His Mercy, we must turn back to Him. Moreover, the heedful slaves of God are those who are “always turning” (munib-Surah Qaf). Indeed, Allah also describes His Prophets as those who are “always turning” (awaab) — just like a physical body does as it travels a perfect circular path.And so, the tawaf is a physcial enactment of this inward “turning” of the heart around the Divine Center. (Hence why we make tawbah counter-clockwise: our left-side, the side of our heart, is tilted to the center). Tawbah, the act of turning to Him, must be done continuously — not simply time to time — if we truly wish to be in His Presence. It is not just a turning away from the occasional sin, but a turning away from heedlessness to remembrance of Him (dhikr) in every moment. The longer we go without it, the more we drift from our center and the farther our distance from the Divine.As our Prophet (SAW) said: “Always keep your tongue moist with the remembrance of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime.” (Ibn Majah)*The square, in contrast, represents earthly spatiality; the four corners represent the four cardinal directions.Scratching at the InfiniteExcavating the Quran for Inward MeaningFollowPhysicsMeccaCircle Of LifeIslamHajjWritten byShaffin SiddiquiFollowFollowScratching at the InfiniteFollowSome of my thoughts on verses and tropes in the Quran.

Why is it difficult to disintegrate a smaller liquid droplet in comparison to a larger one?,https://medium.com/@sjosh90/why-is-it-difficult-to-disintegrate-a-smaller-liquid-droplet-in-comparison-to-a-larger-one-c44c3d7ef56b?source=tag_archive---------7-----------------------,"Science,Droplet,Science Communication,Physics,Everyday Science","Photo by Martin Brechtl on UnsplashDo you think the raindrops we receive at the ground have the same size during their entire journey? No. They form in the clouds. They coalesce as they come down and form bigger droplets. These bigger droplets then disintegrate (anatomy of a raindrop). Villermaux and Bossa believe that the raindrop disintegration happens through this beautiful mechanism (for the high-definition video, I highly recommend watching this supplementary movie). Initially, the droplet deforms/flattens, and then, it disintegrates into smaller droplets. These smaller droplets are the ones which we receive at the ground. These smaller droplets do not undergo further disintegration before they hit the ground. They are more ‘stable’ and spherical (please watch the high-definition video) than their big parent droplets. Why?This video compares different raindrop sizes. A cloud droplet is around 10 micron in diameter (around one-tenth the thickness of a hair strand) whereas the large raindrop can be as big as 4 mm in diameter (half the diameter of a pencil). Also, the smaller droplets are shown spherical whereas the larger ones are shown flattened at the bottom. Why?Now, let’s do a thought experiment:Imagine that you have two perfectly spherical water droplets: one having a diameter of 50 microns (around half the thickness of a hair strand) and the other having a diameter of 2 mm. These droplets are suddenly subjected to an air jet (the air jet velocity is not very high and the accelerations imparted to the droplets are smaller than the acceleration due to gravity). Which of the droplets is more likely to deform or deform and disintegrate?If you read the first two paragraphs of this article, you would say the bigger droplet is more likely to deform or deform and disintegrate. That’s right. But why? We know that liquids have surface tension, and it is surface tension that makes a liquid droplet spherical. The surface tension tries to minimize the surface area of a droplet. For a given volume, a sphere has a minimum surface area. Hence, the surface tension opposes the deformation of a droplet from a sphere to any other shape, as it increases the surface area.The droplets from our thought experiment are of the same liquid. The surface tension value is the same for both of them. So, why is the bigger droplet more likely to deform in comparison to the smaller one even though the surface tension, which resists deformation, is the same for both the droplets? The only difference in the characteristics of those two droplets is their sizes. Is the droplet size playing a role here? Yes.The Laplace law for a liquid droplet is written below:where pᵢₙ and pₒᵤₜ are the pressure values inside and outside the droplet, σ is the surface tension of the liquid and R is the radius of the droplet.For the smaller droplet from our thought experiment, the value of 2σ/R is larger in comparison to the bigger droplet. Hence,The value of pₒᵤₜ is the same for both the droplets (this is true for slow-moving droplets). Hence,Hence, for the same external conditions, deforming the smaller droplet would require greater force in comparison to the larger droplet. These two droplets are like volleyballs with different pressures inside. The volleyball with higher inside pressure (like the smaller droplet) would be difficult to squeeze (deform) in comparison to the volleyball with lower inside pressure (like the bigger droplet). The smaller the droplet, the higher would be the inside pressure, and more difficult it would be to deform and break such a droplet. Hence, (1) the smaller droplet tends to be spherical at external conditions at which the bigger droplet may deform and break as shown in this video, and (2) the smaller droplets in this video are ‘stable’ and spherical and do not undergo further disintegration.To deform and break a droplet, there must be relative velocity between the droplet and the surrounding flow field. The ways by which relative velocity is created between droplets and the surrounding flow field are different for different phenomena. For example, raindrops fall under gravity. Their downward movement in the air (which is at a different velocity compared to the droplet) gives rise to relative velocity. In engineering applications, the relative velocity is created by imparting droplets or surrounding gas high velocities. No matter what the way of creating relative velocity is, the smaller the droplet, the more difficult it would be to deform and break it.Written bySumit JoshiPhD student, IIT Madras, IndiaFollowScienceDropletScience CommunicationPhysicsEveryday ScienceMore from Sumit JoshiFollowPhD student, IIT Madras, IndiaMore From MediumA New Gene of Breast Cancer Has Been Discovered in Very Young WomenAndrei Tapalaga ✒️ in Dialogue & DiscourseSurvival of the Fattest: Fat Babies and Human Brain Evolution (research summary)Kristi StoroschukDo Plants Get Cancer?Sam Westreich, PhDShould We Pay Mothers to Donate Placentas?Matilda Battersby“All Models Are Wrong” Does Not Mean What You Think It MeansGeorgi Georgiev in The StartupUntangling the microbiome — with statisticsStanford Medicine in Scope - Stanford MedicineReady For Your Real Life Avatar?James Maynard in The Cosmic CompanionDemystifying EvolutionThe Curious Learner in Dialogue & DiscourseAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Newton’s Third Law,https://medium.com/physics-daily/newtons-third-law-a100a001b36d?source=tag_archive---------8-----------------------,"Physics,Amazing,Wonder,Mathematics,Science","The Third Law of Motion is the most popular of all. It says about the action-reaction nature of forces. I am sure you have heard of it. This law is really important in understanding physics and what this law says is also truly amazing. When I try and think how Newton arrived at this conclusion, it blows up my mind. Observing such phenomenon requires great focus and only very few people like Newton have this.This law states that- “Each and every action has an equal and opposite reaction.” And what’s actually so amazing about this law is that it applies to each and every object, from objects as light as a feather to the whole entire earth itself, all observe it the same way. Just imagine if you stamp your feet against the ground, you apply a force on the earth but at the very same instant the earth applies an equal amount of force on you, how amazing that is! If we try and punch a brick wall it hurts a lot, but try asking yourself why, why does it hurt? You are punching the wall the wall isn’t punching you but still you get hurt, why is that so? The answer to this question and many such questions is given by this law. Well coming back to our question, why do we get hurt, what is happening there is that when we try and punch the wall, we exert a high amount of force on that wall and according to Newton’s Third law the wall exerts a same amount of force back on our hand, and that is why we get hurt.Now we can reason why we get hurt. It feels nice when we can reason things. Remember that curiosity and our quest for knowledge and the ability to reason is what have gave us humans all we have today. Curiosity is the basis of discovery. The flame of curiosity should always glow bigger.

They took everything we know about our solar system and calculated where every planet would be upto 5 billion years in the future.All science related articlesTo do so they ran over 2,000 + numerical simulations with the same exact initial conditions( conditions that were present at that time ), except for one difference: the distance between planet Mercury and the Sun, modified by less than a millimeter from one simulation to the next.Problem(2)Shockingly, in about only 1 % of their simulations, Mercury’s orbit changed so drastically that it could fall into the Sun or could collide with Venus. Worse yet, in one simulation it destabilized in the entire inner solar system.This was not an error; the very surprising variety in results reveals the truth, about our solar system, that our solar system may be much less stable than it seems. Astrophysicists refer to this astonishing or surprising property of gravitational systems as the n-body problem. While we have equations and formulas that can completely predict the motions of two gravitating masses, our analytical tools fall short when faced with more populated dense systems.It’s actually impossible to write downall the terms of a general formula that can exactly describe the motion of three or more gravitating objects.

"<strong class=""cc"">Demystifying Yoga part 5</strong>",https://medium.com/illumination/demystifying-yoga-part-5-a067635105fd?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Physics,Quantum Philosophy,Spirituality,Religion,God","Science, spirituality, and religion are connected; Image used under license from Shutterstock.com, image by Ekaterina KulaevaThe quest of science, spirituality, and religion, all three, is to explain the world and understand creation.While religion relies on mythology, spirituality uses self as a laboratory to understand the microcosm and uses that to reach the macrocosm. Science uses the external world as the laboratory to understand both the microcosm and macrocosm. Major eastern religions like Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism are basically spiritual philosophies that are rational and scientific provided we strip off the rituals that have got attached to them over the past so many years.Vedanta/Yoga, the source of Hinduism, claims that everything and every event in the world is simply a different expression of the same Ultimate Reality, called ‘Brahman’. As per Vedanta, ‘Brahman’ is the all-encompassing universal power that energizes life. Since everything, including us, is a part of ‘Brahman’, our intellect cannot comprehend it; we can only experience it. Vedanta, unlike religion, does not personalize ‘Brahman’ or give it a human form. A detailed explanation of ‘Brahman’ is included in my previous article in the series, Demystifying Yoga — Part 4 — Meditation and God-realization.In his book, Tao of Physics, physicist, Fritjof Capra says“Science and religion are often considered entirely disparate concepts and a clear line is often drawn between Western rational thinking and more intuitive or spiritually oriented Eastern schools of thought, but when we compare some of the fundamental notions of the major Eastern religions — namely Buddhism, Hinduism, and Taoism — with modern science, especially modern physics, we see many similarities. Whether it’s the basic interconnectedness of all particles or the nature of Space and time in Einstein’s theory of relativity, it seems that Eastern religions have been presenting similar concepts for millennia. Much like physicists, Eastern mystics learn through observation. The only difference is that, while a physicist observes through scientific experimentation, mystics observe through introspection.”Fritjof Capra has also alluded to a parallel between the ‘Brahman’ in yoga and Quantum Field in physics, in this book.What is the Quantum field, and how is it similar in concept to ‘Bhraman’ postulated in Vedanta?Modern physics is based on two core concepts — the Theory of Relativity and Quantum Mechanics (Standard Model of particle physics).Theory of Special RelativityTime is relative; Image used under license from Shutterstock.com, image by chaossThe theory of Special Relativity by Einstein proves that time and space are relative — space is not a three-dimensional entity, independent of time, but rather inseparably joined with it in a concept called space-time. The timing of events depends on the motion in space, and therefore one cannot talk about the ‘time of an event’ purely in terms of some absolute time but must state this in terms of space-time. The implication is that space and time do not exist independently but only as a single continuum, which means that all events, past, present, and future, coexist in the universe though observers see them sequentially.“To us convinced physicists, the distinctions between past, present, and future are illusory, however persistent.” Einstein“Events do not happen: they are just there, and we come across them…. (as) the observer on his voyage of exploration.” Famous astronomer, Sir Arthur EddingtonVedanta claims that time and space have no beginning or end; time stretches limitlessly both backward, and forward and so does space, extend on all sides without boundaries. The world, as we see, limited in time and space is illusionary, the reality is all-encompassing.Theory of General RelativityUnification of matter and space; Image used under license from Shutterstock.com, image by vchalGeneral Relativity brings together all matter and space as being subject to the same laws of the gravitational field. Before this, Space had been synonymous with emptiness, Einstein, however, stated that space is the gravitational field, and it is continuously affecting all matter.As per yoga, all universe, including human beings, are made up of gross and subtle forces -matter and space (the body is gross, and mind/emotion-intellect is subtle). Gross effects subtle and vice versa. The upkeep of our physical body affects our emotional and mental health, and similarly, our emotions and thoughts affect our physical health.Quantum Mechanics (Standard Theory of particle physics)Quantum particle with wave attribution; Image used under license from Shutterstock.com, image by AdityaSinhaQuantum mechanics is our best explanation of what is going on at the microcosmic level of atoms and particles. Quantum particles can behave like particles, located in a single place, or they can act like waves, distributed all over space or in several places at once. How they appear seems to depend on how we choose to measure them, and before we measure, they seem to have no definite properties at all! This leads to a fundamental question about the nature of underlying reality (paradoxes such as Schrodinger’s cat, in which a cat is left dead and alive at the same time).This confirms the fundamental essence of yoga that everything in the world is subjective and ever-changing. In other words, everyone perceives the world as per his/her reality. As you change your perception, you change your reality!The Standard Model of particle physics explains all the quantum particles and how these particles interact to make all the matter in the universe, including living beings. It comprises 12 fundamental particles that make matter (electrons, up-quarks, and down-quarks, etc.) and four particles called Bosons that are responsible for the three fundamental forces of nature — Electromagnetism (responsible for holding together the atoms), The Strong Force (responsible for the stability of the nucleus at the heart of the atom) and, The Weak Force (responsible for the radioactive decay of some atoms). Each of these three forces, just like the gravitational force, is a field — electromagnetic field, the strong force field, and the weak force field. Reality is fundamentally many different fields. Fields are continuous, not discrete. The concept of field applies to both massive objects like the sun and the subatomic world of particles (macrocosm and the microcosm).Fields; Image used under license from Shutterstock.com, image by Fouad A. SaadHowever, the Standard Model of particle physics could not explain how particles gain mass almost until 1964!! Without mass, the universe would not exist!!What then gives mass to matter and makes existence possible?This was finally explained by Higgs Field (also called Quantum field) and the Higgs Boson particle (or the God Particle), hypothesized in 1964 and proven in 2012.Higgs field is an energy field that permeates the entire universe. All particles are massless but gain mass when they interact with this energy field. The particle responsible for creating this field is called the Higgs Boson. Given that this particle is responsible for energizing or giving life to all Matter, it is also called God Particle! This energy field is the universal medium that gives particles (hence all matter in the universe) their mass and is also called the Quantum field.How does it work?Arvin Ash (http://arvinash.com/), while explaining this used an analogy of a fish in the water. Imagine If you were a fish, would you know that the entire world in which you existed was contained in a substance called water? You probably wouldn’t know it because you have always been in it. Water would just be there, enabling life without you even realizing it. Higgs field or the Quantum field is also such a field that permeates the entire universe we live in — without which we could not exist. It is theorized that different particles interact differently with the field. The particles that interact with it more intensely have greater mass than particles that don’t interact with it. E.g., a pointed nose fish would be able to flow very quickly through the water because of low resistance, a block fish would have higher resistance and would interact with the water to a greater degree. Subatomic particles similarly interact with the Higgs field. Just like this fish, which needs water to breathe, we need the Quantum field to exist.This field is fundamental; the particles are not. All objects in the universe, including the sun, the planets, all objects, all living beings, everything is in this one continuous field. All creation happens in this field. This Quantum field is what yoga calls ‘Brahman.’Stephen Hawking, in his book — Brief answers to the big questions, says, “Forces govern our universe — but a divine creator probably isn’t among them.”Vedanta does not talk about a divine creator at all. Instead, it defines ‘Brahman’ as the Ultimate Reality, the fundamental truth which is all prevailing, where all creation happens and that which energizes/vitalizes the world, which is how Physicists define the Quantum field.Let's look at religion. This description of the Quantum field or ‘Brahman’ does not fit the description of God as propagated by religion. Religion is used to thinking/teaching about God as a human-like, sentient being, one with which we can have a personal relationship. Hinduism (born out of Vedanta) has various Gods depicting various laws of nature (e.g., Shiva is the destroyer, Vishnu is the preserver and Brahma is the creator). Hinduism also depicts various qualities as Gods (e.g., Goddess Sarasvati embodies knowledge, Hanuman embodies devotion, Rama embodies a righteous personality, etc.). These are all tools to help people emulate and hence inculcate the right principles in life to start walking on the path of yoga. As per Vedanta, these tools can help take a person to a certain level of understanding but have to be ultimately transcended to reach the universal reality, which is the ‘Brahman’. Look at it as a means for explaining the laws of nature to the masses without taking them through the science which may need a highly developed intellect.In the next article, I will explain the Law of Causation propagated by yoga (based on the understanding we now have of Quantum field) and how it can be leveraged to build a destiny you desire (or deserve!).Sources:The Grand Design by Stephen Hawking and Leonard MlodinowReality is not what it seems by Carlo RovelliA brief history of time by Stephen HawkingTao of Physics by Fritjof CapraVedanta treatise — The eternities by A.

Donald Trump Treat’s COVID-19 Like Schrödinger’s Cat,https://medium.com/@rjallain/donald-trump-treats-covid-19-like-schr%C3%B6dinger-s-cat-7f7781235b69?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Physics,Science,Covid 19,Trump","There’s not just a slip of the tongue or a misstatement. Donald Trump has made quite often made the claim that the COVID numbers in the USA are so bad because of out testing. Here is an exact quote from June 15 (2020).“If you don’t test, you don’t have any cases…If we stopped testing right now, we’d have very few cases if any.”OK, this is just plain silly — as everyone (well, just about everyone knows). Just because you don’t test doesn’t mean you have no cases, it just means you don’t KNOW about those cases.If you use Trump’s line of reasoning, you could say stuff like this:If you don’t check your bank account, you will never run out of money.If you don’t test for diabetes, you will have very few cases of diabetes (OK, this is cheating since this is EXACTLY what he’s saying).If you don’t use a radar gun to check for speeding cars on the highway, no one will be speeding.You get the idea, right?But wait! There is indeed a case where “testing” makes a difference. Maybe Donald Trump is talking about something like the famous Schrödinger’s Cat thought experiment.This experiment is really a reflection of the quantum nature of reality. But in order to understand this Schrödinger’s cat thing — you need to first look at classical physics.Suppose I shoot a ball from launcher. If I know the starting position and the starting velocity, then I can find out the position of that ball at any time in the future. Yes, this seems crazy, but it’s theoretically true. If you know the EXACT starting velocity and position, you are all set. You can even take into account the interactions with the air and walls and stuff. That’s classical physics.Photo: Rhett AllainBut classical physics isn’t the TRUTH. It’s just a model of the real world. It doesn’t work in every situation — in particular, when things get really small stuff starts to get weird. If you want to look at an electron in a hydrogen atom, you don’t get an equation for the trajectory of motion. Instead you get a wave-function.What the heck is a wave-function? It’s complicated, but basically it’s the solution to the Schrödinger equation. It looks like this.Yes, there are many different forms to represent this equation but this one just looks cool. Really, the only thing you need to know about is the Ψ — that is the wave function. This wave function can tell you something about the probability of where you can find the electron.When you get down to really small things, probability is all you get. I know that’s crazy, but that’s what we have. But it’s not probability forever. If you were able to “observe “ (with some type of instrument) the electron in a hydrogen atom, it would be somewhere. So, how do you go from a probability to an actual location?This is a key idea to quantum mechanics. We say that when a system is observed, the wave-function collapses to a single location. When you observe an electron, you know where it is so that there can’t be a probability distribution anymore.OK, I think you are ready for the Schrödinger’s cat experiment. It goes like this.There is this cat in a box. Also in this box is a container of poison. I don’t know why the cat is in with the poison — you can write the back story for homework. But there is a 50 percent chance that the poison container opens up and kills the cat. This means that when you open the box to check on the cat, it’s either alive (with no poison) or dead.But what about the time BEFORE you open the box? Is the cat alive or dead? If you want to use this as an example of a wave-function, then BOTH outcomes can be true. That means the cat can be a combination of alive and dead. However, when you open the box and observe the cat, its wave-function collapses and it’s really alive or really dead.Illustration: Rhett Allain (yup, I made this — for you)So there you go, Schrödinger’s cat experiment. Yes, quantum mechanics is weird.OK, back to Donald Trump. Is it possible that the corona virus is like the cat in the box? If you don’t measure it, it’s both a positive test AND a negative test? I mean, I guess you could say that — but if you don’t do an actual COVID test, you still observe a person. That person can still get sick and infect others even if you don’t test him or her.But really, we all know this. Everyone knows it. Honestly, I think Trump even knows it. I suspect this whole “no testing, no cases” thing went like this.Trump is a reality TV president that is very concerned with ratings and numbers. High numbers of positive COVID tests make him (he thinks) look bad. So, clearly more testing means bad.In one of his rambling speeches, he says the “no testing means no cases” thing without really giving it much thought (surprise, right)?Later, someone on his staff points out the problem with his logic. Maybe he gets it, maybe he doesn’t — but it’s a pretty easy idea to understand.Oh well, that doesn’t matter. He said it once so he either has to double down on this statement or say he was wrong. Which one do you think he picks?So, here we are. He won’t change his statement because he doesn’t want to be wrong. It’s just what he does. Donald Trump’s has been observed and his wave-function has collapsed. We know exactly where he is.Written byRhett AllainPhysics faculty, science blogger of all things geek.

The Elements which shape the Universe, from Hydrogen to Oganesson (Yes! the 118th one). These elements and their compounds are the magical elixirs which fuel the Universe. Yes! literally. Coal is Carbon, which is used to light up our houses and factories, speaking of carbon we all are carbon-based life forms too, including all those species which can’t even read this.Starting from the top Hydrogen, The Very first among all. If the big bang theory is true then for the very first billions of years Hydrogen was the only element present in the Infant Universe as it expanded, Only until the birth of the First Generation of stars.The first generation of stars gave birth to Helium, The second element in the periodic table and both Hydrogen and Helium would have been the only two elements in the Universe for some more billions of years. only until the stars started to turn into super-giants, supernovas etc.As the Universe further expanded, it got more cooled down allowing the heavier elements to exist in stable forms. Lithium, beryllium, Boron, Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen etc. Up to Iron.The Very First Black Holes which are supposed to be the galactic centres of the present galaxies would have pretty much shaped the Universe as we see it now, the first generation black holes would have also given rise to further heavier elements like Silver and Gold and Yes!, to the First Living Organisms. In short, we might not be the only smart civilization but we might be one of the earliest of smart beings.Dark Matter representationThe Truth is the more we learn, the more we realize that how less we know. For instance , 95% of the mass of our galaxy comes from Dark Matter and we don’t have any clue about what it is.ConclusionThe Universe is full of mysteries and we have just begun to unravel the strings and I didn’t even mention any of the subatomic particles here, quarks, leptons, bosons. We think that these are the building blocks of the universe, of which You, I and even this Keyboard I am typing on are made up of. Let’s leave that all for another day, another post.We account for one-sixth of the forces of gravity we see in the universe.

Explainability of Universe in perspective of human being.,https://medium.com/@abhishekkumar7887/explainability-of-universe-in-perspective-of-human-being-f798c38fafe5?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Human Understanding,Explainable,Theory Of Everything,Prime Numbers,Physics","The term explainable AI is around for a while now. Modern human try to understand everything rather to merely use it. It is verified with the fact the exponential rising of edutech based startups viz. Coursera, EdX , Udemy , educative, udacity , unacademy just to name a few.Philosophers have always tried to understand nature and explain it to common folk.But the question remains same, how complex is it to understand an underlying mechanism of a phenomenon. Do we need to make a basic assumption before understanding it or every process is explainable without requiring any underlying assumption.As it turns out, no mathematical theorem or any maths can be proved without any prior assumption and generally we don’t weigh if the particular assumption is built upon some other more basic assumption. The most basic assumption in most cases are found experimentally. Mathematically we say them as axioms or postulates which scientists community regard as ""self evident"".For example-From basic 1. if a=b then b=a 2. if a=b then ac= ab when a,b,c are real numbers.To less basics1. It is possible to draw a straight line from any point to any other point. 2. It is possible to describe a circle with any center and any radius.Physicists call them first principles.Every proof requires assumption. Likewise to understand anything people usually believe a basic assumption to be undebatably true to set a starting point.A Possible AnalogyLet me put an analogy which is the sole reason for writing this article . Isn’t it?People have always learned from analogy with other subjects.The fundamental theorem of arithmetic states that :Every natural number greater than 1 is either a prime itself or can be factorised as a product of primes that is unique up to their order.Simply a natural number is either prime or can be expressed as a multiplication of prime numbers.Like 2(prime), 3(prime), 4=2×2, 5(prime), 6=2×3 and so on.A prime number is a natural number which is divided by 1 or the number itself. Like- 2,3 5,7,11 etc.The same way either a process existing in nature (think why natural numbers are called natural) is the self evident assumption itself or it is built upon several underlying assumptions, remember in nature assumption may be basic or complex that I would explain you further.Like in the past, people experimentally assumed that objects fall to earth or the earth is flat, so people understood the processes built upon those assumptions that you can easily find in the ancient texts(many of them are religious texts like bible) back then.With the progress of people and science, assumptions changed based on experiments and experience. But the style to understand natural processes remained same which is built upon some other assumptions.So .. assumptions are just like prime numbers, uniquely identified. We understand a process or phenomenon based upon those unique assumptions and process itself as a combination(sometimes simple operations and often complex operations) of underlying assumptions.But again sometimes(less often) unknowingly and often beautifullly during our exploration of processes, we encounter some processes which don’t seems to be the combination of our basic prior knowledge assumptions.Like when quantum mechanics showed it’s properties and uniqueness , no prior knowledge or assumptions could explain them be it Newtonian science or even realtivity . Amazing we discovered another prime number(unique scientific assumption)!These processes adds more set of assumptions to our existing set which human try to use to further explain processes more accurately and precisely.Like quantum mechanics is now used to explain even simple Newtonian phenomena and sometimes used in conjunction with relativistic assumptions in hope to explain the other processes more finely.So quantum mechanics , relativistic assumptions fits in the definition of our prime assumptions. Aren’t they?They are unique and cannot be explained with simpler assumptions like with Newtonian or Euclidean assumptions. But we can use these prime assumptions to explain composite phenomena by their combination.With the advancement and rapid growth of our researches, human hope to find more prime assumptions like these.Dark matter and dark energy are possible candidates of our next prime numbers(unique scientific assumption).But as the mathematics say, there are infinite prime numbers but more densely found near 1 and becomes very scarce with the rise.Like there are 8 primes between 1 to 20 and 3 primes between 80 to 100.See the below graph of density distribution of prime numbers.In Number theory, Prime number theorem states that “Primes become less common as they become larger by precisely quantifying the rate at which this occurs.”There are many processes which we don't really know how they work but we experimentally see their results and we try to explain them on the basis of those prior scientific assumptions. We can get a close estimate by this but we don't really can know them untill we actually discover a concrete prime assumption.Mathematics says we can never accurately predict a n’th prime number, there’s no formula of it, we can only estimate it with some relative error.Like if someone ask you to tell (10^52)th prime number ,will you or your computer be able to tell accurately? Ask your CS professor.Like Prime Number Theorem says “The prime number theorem is equivalent to the statement that the nth prime number Pn satisfiesPn ~ n*log(n)The asymptotic notation meaning, again, that the relative error of this approximation approaches 0 as n increases without bound. For example, the (2×10^17)th prime number is 8512677386048191063, and (2×10^17)log(2×10^17) rounds to 7967418752291744388, a relative error of about 6.4%.”A better approximation isAgain considering the (2×10^17)th prime number 8512677386048191063, this gives an estimate of 8512681315554715386; the first 5 digits match and relative error is about 0.00005%.This way we estimate the mechanism of many processes without actually knowing concrete mechanism behind that. That mechanism can only be unleashed by rapid growth of researches.With that being said I believe there are infinitely many unique physics theories which are waiting to be discovered but difficult to find with the rise. A healthy and better environment and research friendly world and mindset is all that human kind need.Written byAbhishek VermaCSE undergrad at TIETFollow8 8 8 Human UnderstandingExplainableTheory Of EverythingPrime NumbersPhysicsMore from Abhishek VermaFollowCSE undergrad at TIETMore From MediumMarkov Chain Monte CarloValentina Alto in Analytics VidhyaApproaches to Solving Problems in PhysicsJoseph Mellor in Cantor’s ParadiseMatrix Inversion and MeaningJoão Paulo Figueira in Zero Equals FalseEstimate any DC Motor Transfer FunctionÇağlayan ŞerbetçiMath’s Beautiful MonstersNautilus in Nautilus MagazineFinding the Majority Element — Is Your Solution Efficient Enough?Taishi Roy in The StartupCalculus where you least expect it.Alex Castañeda in Better AdviceMeasuring Network CentralityJesus Najera in Cantor’s ParadiseAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Minkowski Diagrams and Feigenbaum Bifurcations,https://medium.com/mathadam/minkowski-diagrams-and-feigenbaum-bifurcations-6659e231d4ce?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Math,Physics","Happy August, maths/fizzix peeps!I’d like to share with you some of what I’ve been working on for future stories. As usual, I would appreciate your input. More on that in a bit.First, an outline of what you may have missed: 2 more Special Relativity (SR) stories and 2 stories on how to calculate transcendental numbers with cards and needles.In case you missed it:In response to an email question about SR, I published an article on velocity addition. If Alice’s ship is moving at ¾ light speed, and she fires a bullet at ½ light speed, how fast is the bullet moving? Do we add ¾ + ½ so that the bullet exceeds light speed? Here’s what happens:The Unattainable Speed of LightHow do we fit a ladder in a barn that’s too small for it? If Bob runs with the ladder, it shrinks in size. But according to Bob, it’s the barn that shrinks. How does SR deal with this seeming contradiction?The Ladder Paradox ResolvedBuffon’s Needle is a famous method for estimating π using needles and lined paper. Doesn’t e deserve similar treatment?Buffon’s Needle: Finding π in a Haystack of RandomnessFinding e in Monte CarloIn the works:I’ve created an adjustable Minkowski Diagram on Geogebra. I’m now using it to diagram the previous SR scenarios you’ve already read about. If you don’t know, a Minkowski spacetime diagram compresses space and into 1 dimension each. We then superimpose one frame of reference on the other. Here’s what the velocity addition looks like.Both diagrams show the trajectory of a bullet (the red diagram). First (A) we have Alice’s frame; then (B) Bob’s frame. Alice’s frame is represented by the skewed axes and grid.More details are in the works.Also, in pure maths, we have Dandelin Spheres and Feigenbaum Bifurcations. Dandelin Spheres are an ingenious method for diagramming the properties of conic sections. You may have wondered about the MathAdam header.Dandelion Spheres?Conic sections fits into the category of what you should have been taught in high school math. I’ll try to remedy that.Its really nuts what you can do in Geogebra. Here, a simple function, iterated hundreds of times, displays unpredictable behaviour. The plot splits into two (bifurcates) repeatedly until the splits trip over each other: chaos.That took about 4 lines in Geogebra.Which idea would you like to see developed first? One of these or something else?I welcome your comments to adam@mathadam.caCheers!MathAdamRavings of a quarantined mathematician.Follow3 Sign up for Ravings of a Quarantined MathematicianBy MathAdamA monthly-or-so-ish overview of recent mathy/fizzixy articles published by MathAdam.  Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

But do you think that’s an actual value. Well the answer is no.Actually we experience the sunrise about 2 minutes before the actual sunrise and we experience the sunset 2 minutes after it really happened.So what is the reason behind this delay. Well it’s the simple phenomenon of Refraction. when sunlight passes through the atmosphere, successive refraction occurs and bends the sunlight towards the ground. If we look towards the Sun, the altitude of the observed Sun’s image (i.e. the apparent position of the Sun) will be higher than the actual location of the Sun. Therefore, sunrise occurs before the Sun actually reaches the horizon similarly, the Sun truly disappears below the horizon before sunset happens.Written byYadu KrishnanFollowSciencePhysicsEarthSpaceEducationMore from Yadu KrishnanFollowMore From MediumHow Nuclear Thermal Propulsion Could Revolutionize Space TravelTrevor Mahoney in PredictA Partial Supernova Flung This White Dwarf Across the Milky WayExtremeTech in ExtremeTech AccessDo Earth-Sized Planets Around Other Stars Have Atmospheres?

Friction,https://medium.com/physics-daily/friction-e68142132224?source=tag_archive---------4-----------------------,"Physics,Mathematics,Wonder,Beauty,Perfect","Friction is by far the most misunderstood force of all times. Most of us think that friction is responsible only for slowing things down. Well it’s true, but it does more than that. It is also responsible for making things move .Many a times this the case. When we ride a bicycle what pushes us forward, well we think that we pedal so we move ahead, that’s true for the back tire, but what about the front tire. Who pushes that forward? Why are some surfaces slippery and others rough? We will try and answer such questions here.Surprisingly, friction is the force behind the movement of all vehicles. See, the engines are mostly responsible for forcing the rear tires to move, but it is actually friction which is responsible for the movement of the front wheels. If there would have been no friction the front wheels wouldn’t rotate and just skid on the road. This is because, according to newton’s first law, a stationary object does not move without a force, and because there is force on the front wheel it would just not move. There are two types of friction forces- Kinetic friction and Static friction. Static friction tries to prevent the movement of a stationary object which is being forced to move. And Kinetic friction slows an already moving object. But now, another question arises- Who provides this frictional force? It is the ground which provides friction. Actually all surfaces are capable to provide some amount of friction, from concrete roads to our skin and even air, all provide friction [Friction due to air and water, fluids in general, is called viscosity]. Now, we know that some objects are slippery while others are rough. This variation also happens due to friction. Actually, this happens due to the varied amounts of friction. Frictional force [f] is equal to: f=uN. This “u” [actually Greek letter mu] is called the coefficient of friction, it varies for according to kinetic or static and from surface to surface. The coefficient of friction, decides the amount of friction and it differs from surface to surface. So the more the friction coefficient, rougher the surface and less friction coefficient results on a slippery surface.Well that marks an end to our very brief discussion on friction. But there is something this blog tells, but does not answer. After reading this blog, if you find something that is introduced here but does not answer, please write it in the comments and I will make another blog to answer that.

The Shocking Truth About These 6 Space Discoveries,https://medium.com/@charliestephen6/the-shocking-truth-about-these-6-space-discoveries-17066b479eb8?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Space,Science,Universe,Technology,Physics","Photo by PixabayWhen it comes to our universe, there is no shortage of questions. As we increase our ability to take a deeper look at space, the number of discoveries increases as well.Often, these incredible discoveries become total mysteries. Even the most brilliant scientists and researchers among us have no explanation for them.Let us examine six (6) recent discoveries in space that have left experts speechless.Photo by Public DomainMagic Island of TitanTitan is the largest of Saturn’s moons and could very well be one of the most compelling members of our solar system. Many view it as a primeval Earth because it has an atmosphere, bodies of liquid, and possibly some geological activity.Here are 7 Fascinating Ways That Physics Seems to Defy LogicSubtle physical phenomena that are often counterintuitivemedium.comIn the year 2013, the Cassini spacecraft, that was orbiting Titan, discovered a new landmass that mysteriously appeared out of the moon’s second-biggest sea, Ligeria Mare¹. And then shortly after this amazing discovery, this “Magic Island” disappeared just as mysteriously as it had appeared.Later, the island showed up again as an even bigger landmass. While no one can explain with certainty why this island appears and disappears like this, some think it might be attributed to the heating and cooling of nitrogen. Perhaps the island disappears when its nitrogen bubbles away and reappears when it cools.Photo by PixabayAn Asteroid with Six TailsHow about the time that the Hubble Telescope found an asteroid disguised as a comet? This is precisely what happened whenever asteroid P/2013 P5 was discovered².The 5 Greatest Blunders in the History of ScienceWhat did we learn from their mistakes?medium.comWhile comets are generally easy to identify because of their bright, streaming tails, this is not the case with asteroids. It is because they have very little ice and are comprised mostly of rock and other heavier elements. This is why finding an asteroid with six tails was a fantastic discovery.No one has a clue why P5 looks and behaves the way it does. Some believe that it might be rotating so rapidly that it is destroying itself. Its small gravitational field cannot withstand the powerful rotational that are ripping it apart. And it is the radiation pressure from various solar emissions that spreads all the debris and particles into remarkable, comet-like appendages.Photo by PixabayThe Distant Monster PlanetA distant monster planet known as HD 106906b has become a real dilemma for astronomers³.

These creations will revolutionize the…medium.comFor instance, HD lies a mind-boggling 650 astronomical units (AU) from its parent star. To get a perspective of this, Neptune is the most distant planet in our solar system, yet it lies only 30 AU from the Sun.Before the discovery of HD, scientists had long since concluded all the forces that cause the forming of planets would typically come undone by huge distances. Therefore, HD should not even exist — much less be a massive planet.Photo by Public DomainThe Triple-Star SystemEveryone knows that the Kepler Space Observatory spends most of its time hunting for new planets. However, there was a time that it spent four years observing three stars that are gravitationally bound to one another. This triple star system is known as KIC 28569⁶⁰⁴.KIC consists of two small dwarf stars in a binary system that was in orbit with a third stellar body. Kepler observed four dips daily in the light curve when the dwarfs crossed one another every six hours. And it would observe another light dip every 204 days when the third star would eclipse the binary stars.6 Astonishing Ways that our Massive Universe Could DieLearn about the 6 astonishing ways that our universe may come to its end. Most people are amazed by these.medium.comThe mystery surrounding KIC was in its data. Even after collecting four years’ worth of data, they could not calculate the stellar masses of the three stars. No matter how they crunched these numbers, none of their answers made any sense at all.The only potential answer for the data that they’d collected was unthinkable. This triple star system might contain a fourth star, but if this were the case, its orbit would have to mimic that of the third star perfectly.Photo by Public DomainUranus Is StormyUranus has baffled astronomers. As the second-farthest planet in our solar system, Uranus is usually relatively calm. Yet for some crazy reason, raging storms have been taking place on its surface⁵.These storms are expected when the planet reaches the equinox of its 82-year orbit, and they generally occur on its equator. Yet in 2007, its stormy weather refused to abate as the planet continued its trajectory around the Sun.5 Amazing Things Quantum Computers Will Easily Do For PeopleIf you are like me, then you marvel at the latest advances in technology. These accomplishments by the finest minds in…medium.comSince Uranus has no internal heat source, it needs solar energy to fuel these storms. Astronomers at the University of Berkeley, California, noted the existence of these stormy in the upper region of this planet. Several of these storms are about the size of Earth as they spiral all through the planet’s atmosphere. These storms shine so intensely that large light patches can be easily observed on its surface.No one understands how these storms on Uranus can exist without solar heat. Even when its northern hemisphere plunges into the shadow, it continues to host these violent storms.Photo by Public DomainThe Odd Asteroid That Has RingsAll of the gas giants in our solar system are surrounded by rings. Most of these rings are comprised of celestial debris. Yet there was a time when astronomers observed a ring around an asteroid⁶. And it was quite unexpected.These 6 Astonishing Miracles Prove There Must Be a GodReasons why a higher being has to existmedium.comThis asteroid was named Chariklo, and it was around 155 miles wide. Aside from being the largest body in its vicinity, it was actually an unremarkable piece of space rock. That all changed after its anomalous light signature was observed.It was during the eclipse of a faraway star that an unexpected dip in light was noticed. The dimming led to the discovery of this unique asteroid.A closer look revealed that Chariklo actually has two rings. The larger ring is 4 miles wide, while the smaller ring is around 2 miles wide.Occasionally, some asteroids have their own moons, but never before was a ring found around one. This is what makes Chariklo very unique. No one knows anything about the origin of its mysterious rings. Most experts suspect it was the result of an impact with a foreign body.[1]: Paul Gilster.

"Marie Curie, Two Time Nobel Prize Winner in Chemistry and Physics",https://medium.com/rediscover-steam/marie-curie-two-time-nobel-prize-winner-in-chemistry-and-physics-d6445c258194?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"STEM,Women in STEM,Empowerment,Chemistry,Physics","Marie Curie was born as Maria Skłodowska on November 7, 1867 in Warsaw, Poland. Curie was the youngest of five children, and both of her parents were school teachers. Her father was a mathematics and physics teacher and gave her some scientific education. However, Curie lost her mother to tuberculosis when she was only 10 years old.Despite being an intelligent student with much potential, Curie could not attend a regular college just because she was a woman. So, she attended Warsaw’s secretive “Flying University” or “Floating University” that admitted women who were rejected from Polish universities. This underground university operated from 1885 to 1905 to provide Polish youth with educational opportunities outside government censorship. These kinds of institutions were important in the 19th century in the resistance against Germanization.Marie Curie and her sister Bronisława dreamed of earning an official degree abroad; however, they were in financial hardship. Thus, Marie agreed to work as a governess to support Bronisława while in school, and Bronisława did the same for Marie after she completed her studies to help Marie move to Paris and enroll at the prestigious Paris-Sorbonne University in 1891. Curie continued to study physics, chemistry, and mathematics in her freetime before her formal studies in college. Despite her sister’s help, university was incredibly challenging. Marie still had little to eat and wear, and her health sometimes suffered due to a poor diet.In 1893, she earned her Master’s Degree in Physics and earned her Master’s in Mathematics in 1894. During her studies, she met her future husband, Pierre Curie, when he was a Professor at the School of Physics. In 1895, they got married and had two daughters, Irène (born in 1897) and Ève (born in 1904).Curie did not stop her scientific work even with the birth of her two daughters. With the aid of Pierre and another physicist, Henri Becquerel, Curie found the radioactive elements polonium (named after her native country Poland) and radium and developed the theory of “radioactivity” that was first discovered by Becquerel. In 1903, Curie received a Nobel Prize in Physics, and she received her Doctorate of Science in June. In December, 1904, she was appointed chief assistant in the laboratory directed by her husband. However, Curie lost her husband on April 19, 1906 in a tragic road accident. Pierre was struck by a horse-drawn vehicle and fell under its wheels, fracturing his skull. This was a great loss for Curie. Soon after his death, on May 13, 1906, she took over his position at Sorbonne and became the first female professor there. In 1908, she became titular professor, and her fundamental treatise on radioactivity was published two years after. In 1911, Curie received another Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her isolation of radium and other work in radioactivity. Curie also received many other awards, including the Davy Medal of the Royal Society in 1903 and a gram of radium from President Harding of the United States in 1921. She was and is still the only person to win the Nobel Prize in two different fields.Marie Curie also played a large role in developing the use of X-rays during World War I with the help of her firstborn daughter. Beginning in 1922, Curie was a member of the Academy of Medicine and researched intensively the chemistry of radioactive substances and their potential medical applications.She also traveled to the United States, Belgium, Spain, Brazil, and Czechoslovakia and gave lectures. She founded the Curie Institutes in Paris and Warsaw, which are still major centers of medical research to this day.Unfortunately, Curie passed away at the age of 66 on July 4, 1934, due to the exposure to radiation during her research that caused her to get aplastic anaemia, a rare disease in which not enough blood cells can be produced from the bone marrow. Her daughter, Irène, would grow up to become a famous chemist and physicist just like her mother, continuing the Curie family legacy of a total of five Nobel Prizes. Marie Curie not only pioneered research in radioactivity but paved the way for many other women to pursue careers in the STEAM fields.“Nothing in life is to be feared; it is to be understood.

Does time exist….??,https://medium.com/@digitalmarketing0069/does-time-exist-dfb1e383a8e7?source=tag_archive---------2-----------------------,"Time,Science,Physics,Life,Time Management","Photo by Andrik Langfield on UnsplashThe earliest time measurements were observations of cycles of the natural world, using patterns of changes from day to night and season to season to build calendars. More precise time-keeping, like sundials and mechanical clocks, eventually came along to put time in more convenient boxes.But what exactly is it that we’re measuring? Is time something that physically exists, or is it just in our heads?At first the answer seems obvious — of course time exists; it constantly unfolds all around us, and it’s hard to imagine the universe without it. But our understanding of time started getting complicated thanks to Einstein. His theory of relativity tells us that time passes for everyone; but doesn’t always pass at the same rate for people in different situations; like those travelling close to the speed of light or orbiting a supermassive black hole. Einstein resolved the malleability of time by combining it with space to define space-time, which can bend; but behaves in consistent, predictable ways. Einstein’s theory seemed to confirm that time is woven into the very fabric of the universe.But there’s a big question it didn’t fully resolve: why is it we can move through space in any direction,but through time in only one?Photo by Djim Loic on UnsplashNo matter what we do, the past is always, stubbornly, behind us; this is called the arrow of time. When a drop of food coloring is dropped into a glass of water, we instinctively know that the coloring will drift out from the drop, eventually filling the glass. Imagine watching the opposite happen. Here, we’d recognize time as unfolding backwards. We live in a universe where the food coloring spreads out in the water, not a universe where it collects together. In physics, this is described by the Second Law of Thermodynamics,which says that systems will gain disorder or entropy, over time. Systems in our universe move from order to disorder, and it is that property of the universe that defines the direction of time’s arrow.So if time is such a fundamental property, it should be in our most fundamental equations describing the universe, right?We currently have two sets of equations that govern physics.General relativity describes the behavior of very large things, while quantum physics explains the very small. One of the biggest goals in theoretical physics over the last half century has been reconciling the two into one fundamental “theory of everything.” There have been many attempts — none yet proven — and they treat time in different ways. Oddly enough, one contender called the Wheeler-De Witt equation, doesn’t include time at all. Like all current theories of everything, that equation is speculative.But as a thought experiment, if it or a similarly time-starved equation turned out to be true, would that mean that time doesn’t exist, at the most fundamental level? Could time just be some sort of illusion generated by the limitations of the way we perceive the universe?Photo by Brad Neathery on UnsplashWe don’t yet know, but maybe that’s the wrong way of thinking about it. Instead of asking if time exists as a fundamental property, maybe it could exist as an emergent one. Emergent properties are things that don’t exist in individual pieces of a system, but do exist for the system as a whole. Each individual water molecule doesn’t have a tide, but the whole ocean does. A movie creates change through time by using a series of still images that appear to have a fluid, continuous change between them. Flipping through the images fast enough, our brains perceive the passage of time from the sequence of still images. No individual frame of the movie changes or contains the passage of time, but it’s a property that comes out of how the pieces are strung together. The movement is real, yet also an illusion. Could the physics of time somehow be a similar illusion? Physicists are still exploring these and other questions, so we’re far from a complete explanation. At least for the moment.Written byTanishq ThakurWe make short articles on science and scientific tips ..follow to stay tunedFollow26 26 26 TimeSciencePhysicsLifeTime ManagementMore from Tanishq ThakurFollowWe make short articles on science and scientific tips ..follow to stay tunedMore From MediumAtoms vs Elements vs Compounds Chemistry Made SimpleRyle ZhouA Biological Battery Inspired By Electric Eels Could Soon Power Your Pacemaker𝐆𝐫𝐫𝐥𝐒𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐬𝐭, scientist & writer in The StartupOsmosis: phenomenon born out of plant science linked physics and physiology, saves livesRupesh Paudyal in TalkPlantTowing an Iceberg: One Captain’s Plan to Bring Drinking Water to 4 Million PeopleBloomberg Businessweek in Bloomberg BusinessweekWelcome to the DNA worldEnrique Dans in Enrique DansQuantum mechanics may allow us to alter the timelineTim Andersen, Ph.D. in The Infinite UniverseA Quantum Superposition of Speed: How Time Flies in the Quantum RealmRobert Lea in PredictHow Digital Audio WorksDon CrossAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

The Arrow of Time [1]: What Thermodynamics Doesn’t Tell You,https://medium.com/@tim.lou/the-arrow-of-time-1-what-thermodynamics-doesnt-tell-you-6fa579fb1a53?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Physics,Science,Statistics,Mathematics,Philosophy","The irreversibility of time is ubiquitous, but it’s not so obvious why that has to be the case (Photo by Aron Visuals)“An inch of time is an inch of gold”: The transience of time has been known since time immemorial. Unlike trekking across an open plain or diving into the ocean’s depths, one can neither explore around nor remain stationary in time. With every tick of the clock, we are faced with the relentless advancement of time.Time’s irreversibility seems contradictory: Einstein’s theory of Relativity unified space and time, and the laws of physics are (approximately) the same in all directions (including forward and backward in time). Yet, our Universe seems to have picked out a unique direction — the arrow of time. Where does this special direction come from?One of the most popular explanations comes from thermodynamics, where the concept of entropy is introduced. The direction of time is aligned with entropy’s increase. This supposedly explains why time is special — it is the unique direction that is picked out by the increase of entropy.Yet, there is something unsettling about this explanation: It seems like we can just explain away the arrow of time by this magical quantity called entropy, without any reference to fundamental physics. The reasoning seems incomplete as well; why does entropy have to increase in the first place?Indeed, I’d argue that the entropic explanation is not much of an explanation at all. Instead, thermodynamics merely rephrases the original question.Let’s examine what thermodynamics tells us.Thermodynamics: An Effective ApproximationThermodynamics has one essential assumption:Thermodynamics approximates a system using random processes and statistics.Thermodynamics approximates dynamics of physical systems as random rolling of dice (by Riho Kroll)To understand how this works, let’s go through an example. Take a standard 6-sided die. Rolling the die yields six outcomes each with 1/6 probability. Now, if I were to divide these six numbers into two categories, let’s say:Lucky numbers: 5, 6Unlucky numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4then a die-roll will be more likely to yield an unlucky number than a lucky number. We can quantify how “lucky” or “unlucky” a category is by counting the number of possibilities (2 vs. 4). The number of possibilities (or its logarithm) is captured by the concept of entropy — there is some level of subjectivity in its definition (I have written another article that offers more insights on this idea).Going back to the physics analogy, the die represents a physical system. The system is assumed to change rapidly and randomly such that each measurement of the system is approximated by a roll of the die. Each side of the die represents a state, and each category corresponds to a set of macroscopic physical quantities. The categories of lucky numbers can be referred to as low entropy states, and the categories of unlucky numbers as high entropy states.Thermodynamics tells us how to count the number of states for a particular category. Each category is characterized by physical properties such as temperature, magnetization, different phases of matter, different amounts of pressure in a gas, and so on.The Arrow of Time: A Thermodynamic ExplanationSo why does entropy have to increase? Well, since a measurement is akin to rolling the die once, the result is more likely to be a high-entropy state (e.g., unlucky numbers). In particular, if the number of sides of the die is increasing as time goes on, then gradually the entropy of the system (defined by the entropy of the category that it is in) will always tend to increase. In other words:An increase in entropy is equivalent to the shift from a lucky roll to an unlucky rollSo in this view, the increase of entropy is critically dependent on the fact that our system was previously in a low-entropy state, so that there is room to move to a higher-entropy state! Otherwise, the system wouldn’t change in the first place.At this point, it is clear that the entropic explanation is rather contrived. Why does the system have a lower entropy in the first place (why do we get progressively less lucky rolls over time)? Generally, this happens because the system initially had some extra restrictions, preventing it from exploring the full range of possible states. In other words:The number of explorable states for the system was smaller in the beginning than in the end.Entropy’s increase is then ultimately tied to the (apparent) gradual increase of the number of explorable states. Of course, all of this discussion will be vacuous if we cannot explain how non-random physical processes can be approximated by random ones. In the end, a complete explanation for the arrow of time needs to go beyond thermodynamics.Epilogue: Looking BeyondTo complete the thermodynamic explanation, we must answer two more questions:How is it that the dynamics of a physical system can be approximated by random processes?Why does the number of states available for exploration get smaller as we travel further back in time?The answers to these questions lie beyond thermodynamics. It turns out that there are two key issues at play:Complex dynamics explains how processes are seemingly randomThe initial conditions of the universe (near the Big Bang) are ultimately responsible for the seemingly smaller number of explorable states at the beginning of timeI’ll dedicate separate articles to each of these topics in the future.

VW One-Ups Tesla With a Revolutionary Battery Breakthrough,https://marker.medium.com/vw-one-ups-tesla-with-a-revolutionary-battery-breakthrough-be51849ea092?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------#cd74,"Volkswagen,Automobile,Electric Vehicles,Tesla,Lithium Battery","A worker assembles one of Volkswagen’s ID.3 electric cars at their factory in Zwickau, Germany, on July 31, 2020. Photo: Jens Schlueter/Stringer/Getty ImagesIn the early 1970s, decades before the cellphone, the handheld video camera, the laptop, or the modern electric car, scientists figured out that lithium, the lightest metal on the periodic table, could make for a revolutionary battery. Researchers at Exxon, hoping to diversify away from oil, were among those who began a series of experiments to create a lithium battery. But as often as not, they had to call the fire department, because the highly volatile element would sometimes catch fire and blow up the lab.Even as researchers since then have managed to enable a massive lithium-ion economy of portable electronic devices, they have never gotten beyond inserting just a small few crumbs of the metal into the batteries powering iPhones, Tesla automobiles, and Chromebooks. Pure lithium has remained the Holy Grail — the presumed best consumer battery possible using currently known principles and technology, but always out of reach since no one could figure out how to actually deploy the metal without the risk of fire.Now, in a colossal claim, QuantumScape, a 10-year-old San Jose, California, startup backed by Bill Gates, said in an interview that it has resolved lithium’s problems, and that VW, the giant German automaker, expects to have cars using pure metallic lithium in their batteries on the road by 2025. Jagdeep Singh, QuantumScape’s CEO, also announced that the company is going public, using a so-called SPAC to list on the New York Stock Exchange in the fourth quarter. The post-listing valuation would be $4.3 billion, Singh said. In a SPAC, a company goes public by merging with an existing, listed shell company.By increasing the distance that EVs can travel on a single charge by 50%, the QuantumScape-powered VWs would instantly be the electric vehicle to beat.VW has verified the breakthrough, though Singh stressed that QuantumScape’s scientists have work remaining: QuantumScape must scale up a laboratory-based cell into a multiple-layer battery, and much could go wrong on the way. But if the claims pan out, the commercial consequences could be substantial, instantly catapulting both VW and QuantumScape into a huge competitive lead in the hotly contested battery and EV industries. By increasing the distance that EVs can travel on a single charge by 50%, the QuantumScape-powered VWs would instantly be the electric vehicle to beat. “There is a significant prize to being first,” said Paul Albertus, a professor at the University of Maryland.Most of the information age is relatively new: It all flows from the invention of the transistor in 1948 at Bell Labs, and the most important technology today — the widely commercial smartphone — is only 13 years old. Not so with the battery. The lead acid battery, still used in almost every motorized vehicle on the planet, was invented in 1859. The guts of the modern lithium-ion battery were invented in 1980 and commercialized by Sony about a decade later. The Sony battery — copied by numerous other manufacturers over the years — worked by allowing just bits of lithium to shuttle between two electrodes, never at risk of building up into an explosion.And for three decades since, that is about where we have been — lithium-ion batteries have slowly become much cheaper and more powerful. They enabled the iPhone revolution, and the Tesla phenomenon. But researchers never stopped thinking about pure metallic lithium, which, for one thing, could make EVs as cheap as conventional vehicles. In projects every year, the U.S. Department of Energy and labs around the world continued to fund research attempting to make the breakthrough.There were two problems that no one could solve. One was that, if metallic lithium came into contact with liquid, it could explode. The other was that, inside the battery, it formed prickly needles that punctured the plastic separator that kept the two electrodes apart, thus causing a short.In 2010, Venkat Viswanathan, a professor at Carnegie Mellon, took a graduate-level mechanical engineering course at Stanford. The professor was Friedrich Prinz. One of his classmates was a student named Tim Holme. And auditing the class was Singh, by then already a well-known Silicon Valley entrepreneur behind a company called Infinera. For a semester, they engaged in vigorous discussions of a “new quantum way of storing energy,” Viswanathan says. That same year, QuantumScape was born, employing Prinz, Holme, and “most of the rest of the class,” he says. Viswanathan himself signed on as a consultant in 2015.It turned the heads of investors like Kleiner Perkins, Khosla Ventures, and Bill Gates, who threw tens of millions of dollars into the startup. Prinz and Holme also got a $1.5 million federal grant to research their idea.The timing was propitious. In 2009, A123, a Boston-based battery startup, was the biggest IPO of the year, worth $371 million. Battery startups began coming out of the woodwork. From coast to coast, newfangled lithium-ion batteries were among the hottest projects you could be involved in. In part, they were funded by President Barack Obama, who set aside $2.4 billion from the post-crash stimulus to create a homegrown U.S. lithium-ion battery industry. But there was much exaggeration and some outright fraud. GM and Dyson, the British vacuum cleaner company, were among the big companies with dreams of getting into EVs that got snookered.Prinz and Holme’s brainchild was a concept that they called an “all-electron battery,” which many of colleagues in the field regarded as a wacky idea. But it turned the heads of investors like Kleiner Perkins, Khosla Ventures, and Bill Gates, who threw tens of millions of dollars into the startup. Prinz and Holme also got a $1.5 million federal grant to research their idea.It wasn’t long before QuantumScape figured out that the skeptics were right. They got out of all-electron batteries and swerved into the biggest problem vexing the conventional battery community — metallic lithium. QuantumScape went wholly stealth; it could do so because it was swimming in money. VW alone, forming a collaborative relationship in 2012, invested $300 million in tranches.Singh says the venture capital investment was the key, buying the startup 10 years to work on a single problem, and outdoing competitors like 24M and Solid Power. Singh declined to go into detail but said that QuantumScape scientists finally discovered a new material that resolved much of the problem. Still, there were “hundreds” of other hurdles the team had to overcome to make the battery work, he says. Now, says Singh, he expects his company’s emergence to ignite a frenzy of new rivals. “People will now know it’s doable,” he says. “There will eventually be competition.”Written bySteve LeVineI am Editor at Large at Medium with interests in ferreting out the whys for the turbulence all around us.

Explainer: What is Quantum Randomness?,https://medium.com/illumination/explainer-what-is-quantum-randomness-f1514421da9d?source=tag_archive---------2-----------------------,"Learning,Education,Physics,Universe,World","Photo by Roman Mager on UnsplashStop! Don’t click away just because of the blackboard image, which might — very likely — trigger a mild form of PTSD from our school days.I’m not about to vicariously exact cruel vengeance on you, dear brothers and sisters. Indeed, I’m but a callow muggle, a mere mortal who’d simply like to share some fun facts about our universe with you.I hope you enjoy this short piece.What is quantum randomness?Quantum randomness refers to the inherent randomness of quantum particles. A quantum particle, or elementary particle, is the smallest particle that we know of, and which cannot be divided. Quantum particles are categorised into quarks, leptons, and bosons (coming soon: gravitons).To put it another way, an electron is a quantum particle, but a proton or neutron are not because they can be split into smaller particles called quarks.What do I mean by “random”?There are two types of randomness: apparent randomness and intrinsic randomness.Apparent randomness is randomness that results from our lack of knowledge of a state. For example, a coin flip is apparently random, but if we had the time, we could calculate exactly how the coin would fall, by examining the forces on it in the flip.Intrinsic randomness is randomness that persists even when we have full knowledge of the state. This is the randomness that most people think of when using the word colloquially, and indeed was the result of the famous double slit experiment.Examples of quantum randomnessQuantum particles can pop in and out of existence in a process called quantum fluctuation. This is usually observed by measuring the amount of electrical energy in a position, and it’s been shown to literally come in and out of existence in empty space.As mentioned above, quantum randomness can also be seen in the double slit experiment. This experiment involved shooting a photon at a sheet with two slits, and predicting which slit it would travel through and show up on the photosensitive background. Physicists found that although they can get a close prediction after thousands of runs of the experiment, they can’t calculate exactly which hole the photon will travel through, hence categorising it intrinsically random.Implications in practice and for the big questions of lifeSo what if barely-visible particles do weird stuff. What does it matter to me?I submit that it matters quite a lot more than you might first think.Firstly, many of us believe that the universe is governed by determinism, which essentially is the idea that everything happens in only one way, due to all of the preceding factors, and if you went back in time and didn’t change anything, everything would happen in the exact same way.If things are truly random, then this is a thorn in the side of a determinist. This is an ongoing debate.Another front to use quantum randomness is in security. If you think about it, one way that cryptographers breach security systems is through finding patterns in security systems and predicting their keys. If you have a truly random password generator, for example, then you may have an unbreakable system.Finally, for the purposes of this short article, quantum randomness could have explained the beginnings of our universe. A popular idea is that our universe was a vast expanse of hot matter before the big bang, governed by quantum physics. Quantum randomness then caused the big bang to occur, in very crude terms. See this article for further reading.As is probably profusely evident, I am not an expert in quantum physics. Not by a long shot. I simply wanted to lay out some interesting aspects of our universe.I truly hope you enjoyed this reading.

Quantum Interpretations Part 1: Introduction and History of quantum,https://medium.com/@ngxinzhao/quantum-interpretations-part-1-introduction-and-history-of-quantum-39156b206e4?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"Quantum Physics,Quantum Mechanics,Quantum,Quantum Interpretations,Physics","Having read a lot of popular Physics books, I am quite surprised that there’s no one book that tries to cover the quantum interpretations. (Edit, after writing this, I discovered Jim Baggott’s book: Quantum Reality: The Quest for the Real Meaning of Quantum Mechanics — A Game of Theories, I shall read it and write this based on that as a source too) This is that attempt, it may be a very short book. This series is going chapter by chapter, with a content page here, linked to outside medium, and the rest of the contents in medium. Hopefully, it’ll be good enough quality to be collected and published as a book.So what’s going to be different for this take it that I shall attempt to not include any equations and discuss the major interpretations for one article each, including the philosophical implications of the classical concepts tradeoffs for each interpretation. I shall attempt not to establish the Copahegan interpretation as the default mode and making you guys have to switch it when you want to think in other interpretations.So here’s the general plan:Historical development of quantum theory,The mathematical axioms of quantum as taught to Physics majors in University (as I learnt it) to show why quantum is solid, but not satisfactory in the interpretations.The various experiments which show quantum phenomenon.Classical assumptions which seem to be in danger.A brief overview of what each major interpretation of quantum says.One by one, going through the experiments to see how each interpretation of quantum would say about it, that is how to interpret what really happened in the experiment, or how to think about the maths and experiments that we have.One by one, going through the major interpretations and what classical assumptions tradeoffs they make, as well as the philosophical implications of each interpretation. As a bonus, I shall be putting in my own religion of Buddhism, just to give a picture of how if each interpretation is true, what does it mean for religion. You can do your own thinking of it for your personal religion, having seen the example of what it means for Buddhism if this particular interpretation is true.Sources: I have a bachelor’s degree in Physics and I will rely heavily on the other writings on these interpretations from papers written by physicists to the philosophy encyclopedia, to other writings of popular physics and Wikipedia. I hope to make the subject more approachable compared to what is written in the philosophy encyclopedia and at the level of common popular physics.History of quantum.Let us start by appreciating the history first as this will be the basis of your mental picture of what quantum physics is before it gets very abstract in the mathematical structure.Light in Newton’s days was considered to be particles, but Thomas Young with his famous double-slit experiment showed that light interferes with each other if the distance between the two slits is close to the light’s wavelength, thus light became a wave. This notion became solidified when Maxwell came out with the speed of light from the electromagnetic equations, showing that light is an electromagnetic wave, travelling at the speed of light. Thus we have the picture that electromagnetic waves unite all these radiations as one, just differing by their frequencies. From the shortest frequency to highest, we have radio waves, microwave, infrared, visible light from red to violet (following the rainbow colour arrangement), ultraviolet, X-rays and finally gamma rays. It is based on this wave theory of light which got us into the ultraviolet catastrophe.The first sign of quantum is when Max Planck used the Planck’s constant, h to fit in the data for the black body radiation. Basically, classical theories cannot explain how light interacts with matter, predicting that as light gets to a higher frequency, and lower wavelength, there will be more ways for energy to be emitted from the matter (like when the matter is heated up). When it goes further up the ultraviolet frequency, there should be even more amount of energy emitted. This is in contrast with the experimental fact where the most common frequency of hot body peaks depending on its temperature. Thus you see fire changes colour from red to blue as it gets hotter, and not like spontaneously releasing unlimited gamma rays. Physicists called the failure of classical theories in this area as the ultraviolet catastrophe. The X-rays and Gamma rays haven’t been discovered and named yet, or else it would be called the gamma catastrophe, which would bring about the mental image of the Hulk in most people’s mind nowadays. Maybe it is fortunate naming because this has nothing to do with the Hulk.Planck just helped to hack the system by fitting the data in by making sure energy exchanged between light and matter happens in the form of a discrete amount of energy, proportional to its frequency, linked by Planck’s constant. This is instead of splitting the energy between modes of lights which increases with the square of the frequency and allowing a continuous exchange of energy between matter and light as the classical theory assumed. Planck did felt that his fitting was a mathematical trick and do not believe what the equations told him about the nature of light. That it is quantised. Hence the word quantum in quantum physics came about.Albert Einstein then in 1905 provided the physical interpretation of this usual behaviour by suggesting that lights are particles. We call them photons. Photons as particles carry a discrete amount of energy depending on its frequency. This also explains the photoelectric effect where light only kicks out electrons from metal if its frequency goes high enough (hence enough energy per photon to kick out the electrons), regardless of its intensity (amount of photon). The electrons need a preset amount of energy to be kicked free from the metal, weak low-frequency photons can bump onto the metal all they want, but cannot combine their energy to kick out the electrons. Thus light is no longer considered as continuous wave containing continuous energy, but as photons, particles of light containing quantised energy. By the way, this is the reason Einstein got that Nobel Prize of his, not his general relativity.This was the beginning of the crisis of interpretation.How can a particle explain the double-slit experiment? If we assume that many photons go through the slit then maybe the particles interfere with each other. However, experiments had gone to the point where we can send individual photons to the double-slit and still after collecting enough data, the interference pattern emerges! Did the particles somehow split into two and interferes with itself? Did it interacted with a split parallel universe version of itself and recombined to form the interference? Did the particle travel through time and go through both slits at once interfere with itself and came back to the present to land on the screen? Mental pictures of the quantum world are starting to break down as we insist on using classical concepts onto the quantum particle. Weirder still, try to find out which slits did the photon goes through, then once we know which slit and cannot erase the information, the interference is gone. We get two slits of light for light going through two slits. Light behaves like a particle when information about which slit it goes through is revealed and cannot be erased away without any copies of that information. So it seems that observation changes the outcome, something totally alien to the classical world of physics where it is assumed that the observer can observe and do not affect the observed system. You might have heard of this phenomenon is called wave-particle duality. Light behaves like a wave or particle depending on our decision to observe or not to observe which path it had taken.It seems magical now, the nature or properties of light changes depending on what we do! Some take it as there is no underlying mechanics (reality/ nature) of quantum, some disagree, this becomes a matter of interpretation. Keep in mind that the experiments and ideas which physicists came out with helped them to develop the mathematical structure of quantum theory and step by step lead them away from having a classical mental picture of reality. However, those mathematics can be used to explain and predict experimental results, because it is developed mainly to fit in with experimental results.Next came Niels Bohr, who introduced the atomic model which explains how atoms can be stable and the emission lines of the hydrogen atom. According to classical electromagnetic theory, if the atom is to behave like our solar system, with the nucleus of the atom in the middle like the sun and the electrons orbiting it like planets, then the electron is undergoing acceleration. Yet the electron is a charged particle, accelerating charged particle according to classical electromagnetic theory emits electromagnetic radiation. This is how radio and TV waves can be transmitted and received with the antenna. So if the electron is radiating electromagnetic waves, it must be losing energy and very soon sucked into the positively charged nucleus and the atom is destabilised. If the electrons do not move, then it will be attracted into the nucleus anyway. So it is an utter mystery how atoms which subparts of positive and negative charged particles, and the positive ones in the middle can exist at all.Bohr suggested that electrons can only occupy some orbits, the ones which respect discrete angular momentum. Angular momentum is like momentum, spinning objects tend to remain spinning without outside forces (or torque in this case). Thus if the electrons are at the lowest orbit, it means that it cannot fall into a smaller orbit. Its angular momentum is at the lowest and cannot be reduced. There are no in-between orbits between two lowest orbits, thus angular momentum is quantised, or discretised. This, by the way, is the origin of the concept: quantum jump. As electrons cannot be found in between orbits, but jump from one to another. This is in very much contrast with our usual notion of classical motion as there is no smallest unit of jump or movement unlike in quantum systems.In 1925 and 1926, two different ways of getting the basic equations of quantum mechanics correct were discovered, first the matrix mechanics by Heisenberg, then the wave mechanics by Schrodinger. Both are shown to be equivalent to each other, that is different ways of expressing the same thing.And therein, I shall have to call for a pause in the history lessons. To describe the mathematical structure of the theory is the subject of the next article and both pictures discovered by them are very mathematical. Sufficient to say for now that the theory is basically completed by then as it leads to verifiable predictions and explains the previous experiments. As to what it is and how to interpret it, stay tuned.Written byNg Xin ZhaoBachelors in Physics and Buddhism.

Ask Ethan: Do Neutrinos Always Travel At Nearly The Speed Of Light?,https://medium.com/starts-with-a-bang/ask-ethan-do-neutrinos-always-travel-at-nearly-the-speed-of-light-25c655284f1e?source=tag_archive---------4-----------------------,"Neutrinos,Space,Physics,Speed Of Light,Relativity","For decades, the neutrino was among the most puzzling and elusive of cosmic particles. It took more than two decades from when it was first predicted to when it was finally detected, and they came along with a bunch of surprises that make them unique among all the particles that we know of. They can “change flavor” from one type (electron, mu, tau) into another. All neutrinos always have a left-handed spin; all anti-neutrinos always have a right-handed spin. And every neutrino we’ve ever observed moves at speeds indistinguishable from the speed of light. But must that be so? That’s what Patreon supporter Laird Whitehill wants to know, asking:“I know neutrinos travel almost at the speed of light. But since they have mass, there is no reason that they couldn’t travel at any speed. But [you’ve implied] their mass dictates that they must travel almost at the speed of light.But light travels at a constant speed. But anything with mass can travel at any speed.”So why, then, do we only see neutrinos traveling at velocities consistent with the speed of light? It’s a fascinating question. Let’s dive on in.According to the Standard Model, the leptons and antileptons should all be separate, independent particles from one another. But the three types of neutrino all mix together, indicating they must be massive and, furthermore, that neutrinos and antineutrinos may in fact be the same particle as one another: Majorana fermions. (E. SIEGEL / BEYOND THE GALAXY)The neutrino was first proposed in 1930, when a special type of decay — beta decay — seemed to violate two of the most important conservation laws of all: the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum. When an atomic nucleus decayed in this fashion, it:increased in atomic number by 1,emitted an electron,and lost a little bit of rest mass.When you added up the energy of the electron and the energy of the post-decay nucleus, including all the rest mass energy, it was always slightly less than the rest mass of the initial nucleus. In addition, when you measured the momentum of electron and the post-decay nucleus, it didn’t match the initial momentum of the pre-decay nucleus. Either energy and momentum were being lost, and these supposedly fundamental conservation laws were no good, or there was a hitherto undetected additional particle being created that carried that excess energy and momentum away.Schematic illustration of nuclear beta decay in a massive atomic nucleus. Beta decay is a decay that proceeds through the weak interactions, converting a neutron into a proton, electron, and an anti-electron neutrino. Before the neutrino was known or detected, it appeared that both energy and momentum were not conserved in beta decays. (WIKIMEDIA COMMONS USER INDUCTIVELOAD)It would take approximately 26 years for that particle to be detected: the elusive neutrino. Although we couldn’t quite see these neutrinos directly — and still can’t — we can detect the particles they collide or react with, providing evidence of the neutrino’s existence and teaching us about its properties and interactions. There are a myriad of ways the neutrino has shown itself to us, and each one provides us with an independent measurement and constraint on its properties.We’ve measured neutrinos and antineutrinos produced in nuclear reactors.We’ve measured neutrinos produced by the Sun.We’ve measured neutrinos and antineutrinos produced by cosmic rays that interact with our atmosphere.We’ve measured neutrinos and antineutrinos produced by particle accelerator experiments.We’ve measured neutrinos produced by the closest supernova to occur in the past century: SN 1987A.And, in recent years, we’ve even measured a neutrino coming from the center of an active galaxy — a blazar — from under the ice in Antarctica.The remnant of supernova 1987a, located in the Large Magellanic Cloud some 165,000 light years away. It was the closest observed supernova to Earth in more than three centuries, and the neutrinos that arrived from it came in a burst lasting about ~10 seconds: equivalent to the time that neutrinos are expected to be produced. (NOEL CARBONI & THE ESA/ESO/NASA PHOTOSHOP FITS LIBERATOR)With all of this information combined, we’ve learned an incredible amount of information about these ghostly neutrinos. Some particularly relevant facts are as follows:Every neutrino and antineutrino we’ve ever observed moves at speeds so fast they’re indistinguishable from the speed of light.Neutrinos and antineutrinos both come in three different flavors: electron, mu, and tau.Every neutrino we’ve ever observed is left-handed (if you point your thumb in its direction of motion, your left hand’s fingers “curl” in the direction of its spin, or intrinsic angular momentum), and every anti-neutrino is right-handed.Neutrinos and antineutrinos can oscillate, or change flavor, from one type into another when they pass through matter.And yet neutrinos and antineutrinos, despite appearing to move at the speed of light, must have a non-zero rest mass, otherwise this “neutrino oscillation” phenomenon would not be possible.If you begin with an electron neutrino (black) and allow it to travel through either empty space or matter, it will have a certain probability of oscillating, something that can only happen if neutrinos have very small but non-zero masses. The solar and atmospheric neutrino experiment results are consistent with one another, but not with the full suite of neutrino data including beamline neutrinos. (WIKIMEDIA COMMONS USER STRAIT)Neutrinos and antineutrinos come in a wide variety of energies, and the odds of having a neutrino interact with you increase with a neutrino’s energy. In other words, the more energy your neutrino has, the more likely it is to interact with you. For the majority of neutrinos produced in the modern Universe, through stars, supernovae, and other natural nuclear reactions, it would take about a light-year worth of lead to stop approximately half of the neutrinos fired upon it.All of our observations, combined, have enabled us to draw some conclusions about the rest mass of neutrinos and antineutrinos. First off, they cannot be zero. The three types of neutrino almost certainly have different masses from one another, where the heaviest a neutrino is allowed to be is about 1/4,000,000th the mass of an electron, the next-lightest particle. And through two independent sets of measurements — from the large-scale structure of the Universe and the remnant light left over from the Big Bang — we can conclude that approximately one billion neutrinos and antineutrinos were produced in the Big Bang for every proton in the Universe today.If there were no oscillations due to matter interacting with radiation in the Universe, there would be no scale-dependent wiggles seen in galaxy clustering. The wiggles themselves, shown with the non-wiggly part subtracted out (bottom), is dependent on the impact of the cosmic neutrinos theorized to be present by the Big Bang. Standard Big Bang cosmology corresponds to β=1. Note that if there is a dark matter/neutrino interaction present, the acoustic scale could be altered. (D. BAUMANN ET AL. (2019), NATURE PHYSICS)Here’s where the disconnect between theory and experiment lies. In theory, because neutrinos have a non-zero rest mass, it should be possible for them to slow down to non-relativistic speeds. In theory, the neutrinos left over from the Big Bang should have already slowed down to these speeds, where they’ll only be moving at a few hundred km/s today: slow enough that they should have fallen into galaxies and galaxy clusters by now, making up approximately ~1% of all the dark matter in the Universe.But experimentally, we simply don’t have the capabilities to detect these slow-moving neutrinos directly. Their cross-section is literally millions of times too small to have a chance at seeing them, as these tiny energies wouldn’t produce recoils noticeable by our current equipment. Unless we could accelerate a modern neutrino detector to speeds extremely close to the speed of light, these low-energy neutrinos, the only ones that should exist at non-relativistic speeds, will remain undetectable.A neutrino event, identifiable by the rings of Cherenkov radiation that show up along the photomultiplier tubes lining the detector walls, showcase the successful methodology of neutrino astronomy. This image shows multiple events, and is part of the suite of experiments paving our way to a greater understanding of neutrinos. (SUPER KAMIOKANDE COLLABORATION)And that’s unfortunate, because detecting these low-energy neutrinos — the ones that move slow compared to the speed of light — would enable us to perform an important test that we’ve never performed before. Imagine that you’ve got a neutrino, and you’re traveling behind it. If you look at this neutrino, you’ll measure it moving straight ahead: forwards, in front of you. If you go to measure the neutrino’s angular momentum, it will behave as though it’s spinning counterclockwise: the same as if you pointed your left hand’s thumb forward and watched your fingers curl around it.If the neutrino always moved at the speed of light, it would be impossible to move faster than the neutrino. You’d never, no matter how much energy you put into yourself, be able to overtake it. But if the neutrino has a non-zero rest mass, you should be able to boost yourself to move faster than the neutrino is moving. Instead of seeing it move away from you, you’d see it move towards you. And yet, its angular momentum would have to be the same, in the counterclockwise direction, meaning you’d have to use your right hand to represent it, rather than your left.If you catch a neutrino or antineutrino moving in a particular direction, you’ll find that its intrinsic angular momentum exhibits either clockwise or counterclockwise spin, corresponding to whether the particle in question is a neutrino or antineutrino. Whether right-handed neutrinos (and left-handed antineutrinos) are real or not is an unanswered question that could unlock many mysteries about the cosmos. (HYPERPHYSICS / R NAVE / GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY)This is a fascinating paradox. It seems to indicate that you could transform a matter particle (a neutrino) into an antimatter particle (an antineutrino) simply by changing your motion relative to the neutrino. Alternatively, it’s possible that there really could be right-handed neutrinos and left-handed antineutrinos, and that we’ve just never seen them for some reason. It’s one of the biggest open questions about neutrinos, and the capability to detect low-energy neutrinos — the ones moving slow compared to the speed of light — would answer that question.But we can’t really do that in practice. The lowest-energy neutrinos we’ve ever detected have so much energy that their speed must be, at minimum, 99.99999999995% the speed of light, which means that they can move no slower than 299,792,457.99985 meters-per-second. Even over cosmic distances, when we’ve observed neutrinos arriving from galaxies other than the Milky Way, we’ve detected absolutely no difference between a neutrino’s speed and the speed of light.When a nucleus experiences a double neutron decay, two electrons and two neutrinos get emitted conventionally. If neutrinos obey this see-saw mechanism and are Majorana particles, neutrinoless double beta decay should be possible. Experiments are actively looking for this. (LUDWIG NIEDERMEIER, UNIVERSITAT TUBINGEN / GERDA)Nevertheless, there’s a tantalizing chance we have to resolve this paradox, despite the difficulty inherent to it. It’s possible to have an unstable atomic nucleus that doesn’t just undergo beta decay, but double beta decay: where two neutrons in the nucleus simultaneously both undergo beta decay. We’ve observed this process: where a nucleus changes its atomic number by 2, emits 2 electrons, and energy and momentum are both lost, corresponding to the emission of 2 (anti)neutrinos.But if you could transform a neutrino into an antineutrino simply by changing your frame-of-reference, that would mean that neutrinos are a special, new type of particle that exists only in theory thus far: a Majorana fermion. It would mean that the antineutrino emitted by one nucleus could, hypothetically, be absorbed (as a neutrino) by the other nucleus, and you’d be able to get a decay where:the atomic number of the nucleus changed by 2,2 electrons are emitted,but 0 neutrinos or antineutrinos are emitted.There are currently multiple experiments, including the MAJORANA experiment, looking specifically for this neutrinoless double beta decay. If we observe it, it will fundamentally change our perspective on the elusive neutrino.The GERDA experiment, a decade ago, placed the strongest constraints on neutrinoless double beta decay at the time. The MAJORANA experiment, shown here, has the potential to finally detect this rare decay. It will likely take years for their experiment to yield robust results, but any events at all in excess above the expected background would be groundbreaking. (THE MAJORANA NEUTRINOLESS DOUBLE-BETA DECAY EXPERIMENT / UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON)But for right now, with current technology, the only neutrinos (and antineutrinos) we can detect via their interactions move at speeds indistinguishable from the speed of light. Neutrinos might have mass, but their mass is so small that of all the ways the Universe has to create them, only the neutrinos made in the Big Bang itself should be moving slow compared to the speed of light today. Those neutrinos might be all around us, as an inevitable part of the galaxy, but we cannot directly detect them.In theory, however, neutrinos can absolutely travel at any speed at all, so long as it’s slower than the cosmic speed limit: the speed of light in a vacuum. The issue we have is twofold:slow moving neutrinos have very low probabilities of interactions,and those interactions that do occur are so low in energy that we cannot presently detect them.The only neutrino interactions we see are the ones coming from neutrinos moving indistinguishably close to the speed of light. Until there’s a revolutionary new technology or experimental technique, this will, however unfortunate it is, continue to be the case.Send in your Ask Ethan questions to startswithabang at gmail dot com!Starts With A Bang is now on Forbes, and republished on Medium on a 7-day delay.

Physics taught by Pandemics,https://medium.com/@m.mudassir.hussain/physics-taught-by-pandemics-792663b3f45e?source=tag_archive---------5-----------------------,"Physics,Pandemic,Newton","In a time similar to the one we find ourselves in today, the father of modern day physics made the most important discoveries of his life that would influence science and civilization forever. The pandemic was the plague, the setting was Woolsthorpe and the man was Newton. Lets derive some lessons beyond the science.Following the lockdown of all universities and public places, Newton was forced to leave Cambridge and retreat to his family home in Woolsthorpe. Left in seclusion and deep in thought, Newton would develop the theory of gravity and calculus, far from any academic institution and hub of scientific development.When the apple fell from the tree outside Woolsthorpe Manor, it began the Newton questioned why? Why does an airborne apple take the path it does and land on the ground? What prevents the apple from flying into space? It was questions like these that led to the universal theory of gravitation. All masses attract each other. Each mass exerts a force on all other masses. The force that causes the apple to be attracted to the Earth is the same force that causes the Earth to be attracted towards the apple, albeit at a much smaller scale.When Newton further studied the flight of a falling object, he discovered that the speed of the falling apple increases every split second. The velocity of the falling object is an inherently fluctuating quantity (up-to a certain point) and there was no mathematics at the time that would deal with that problem. This led to the development of calculus as we know it today. Calculus allows us study changing quantities at infinitely small intervals.The lesson however we should take from Newton in this time is not one of science but one of principle. In a time where tragedy struck England and Newton was in quarantine, he found meaning. He was free from the shackles of institution, liberated from discipline and rule. The most productive time of his life was the period where he was alone and left to delve deep into thought.He was in a ‘flow state’. A state where you are so involved in an activity that nothing else matters. We can all achieve flow state but it requires us to find a problem/mission that matters to us above anything else and one we are willing to complete no matter how high the cost.Find your mission, Reach your flow.Written byMudassir HussainAspiring writer on topics such as education, personal development and knowledge management.

Constants of Nature — The Gods of Modernity,https://medium.com/swlh/constants-of-nature-the-gods-of-modernity-81735bea56e1?source=tag_archive---------6-----------------------,"Physics,Fundamental Constants,Cosmology,Einstein,Natural Philosophy","What exactly are constants of nature? Remarkably, physics, considered the most exact of all sciences, hasn’t a good answer. Are they essential for a rational description of reality? No. Fundamental constants are the gods of modernity. But only history makes us understand why it is the job of theoretical physicists to explain them.“I cannot imagine a reasonable unified theory containing an explicit number which the whim of the Creator could just as easily have chosen differently.” — Albert EinsteinImagine looking at the starry sky in the Stone Age, without smog, urban light pollution, and all other annoyances of modern civilization. There can be no doubt that human beings back then were intrigued by the stars and tried to comprehend the laws of the spectacle going on in the skies. In the early hunter-gatherer societies, observing natural phenomena led people to create the first mythologies. Already in ancient Egypt, the appearance of Sirius, which usually preceded the flooding of the Nile, was understood as a signal to start cultivating the fields. This is how we react as human beings: a continuous process of reasoning takes place in our mind, and we try to make sense of what we perceive, connecting facts that may or may not be causally related after all. Back then, it seemed more than obvious that what was going on in the skies was ruled by higher powers such as Re, the solar deity. Who other than a mighty deity could steer the course of the inaccessible stars?Later, the ancient Greeks began to identify the wanderers in the starry sky, called planets, and ascribed divine qualities to them. These systematic observations were nothing other than an early form of scientific research. However, at any period in history, science has had its respective limits of comprehension, beyond which lay unknown territory. In the ancient cultures, some phenomena were called gods because they could not be explained otherwise. Yet, the parallels to modern science are quite obvious. The assumption that it was not just the whim of individual gods that governed planetary motion but rather profound laws may be seen as an early attempt to create a “unified” theory of the universe — something that physicists dream of to this day.Medieval Astronomy and its Arbitrary NumbersAs time went by, people paid more and more attention to planetary motions and recorded them accurately. Yet, despite the idea of a single, almighty God, astronomy was forced to attribute a series of characteristics to the individual planets until the Middle Ages. All orbits were assumed to be precise circles around the Earth, but in order to account for the apparent retrograde motion[i] of some planets (that indeed hinted at the Sun being at the center of their orbits), additional assumptions for their orbits were invoked: so-called epicycles, that is, smaller circles mounted on their larger relatives. As observations became still more accurate, the above description turned out to be insufficient again, prompting the postulation of other workarounds such as the eccentric, a quantity that denoted how far the circle on top of the circle had shifted its original center. Of course, all these assumptions were far from intellectually satisfying, but for lack of any better explanation, astronomers reluctantly accepted the existence of such arbitrary quantities — God-made numbers beyond the limit of human understanding.Geocentric (left) and heliocentric (right) world view after Copernicus. The extremely complicated planetary orbits in the geocentric model were suspicious to many researchers.In his monograph Big Bang, Simon Singh comments on the epicycles as follows:[ii] “Every flawed model can be saved by such fiddling around with numbers.” However, we shall not be tempted to disregard these early forms of science — after all, the geocentric world view back then was by no means stupid or even far-fetched. Observing the sky was already a great achievement in itself. It has to be complemented by looking for deeper theoretical reasons, yet this search is not always in lockstep with observational progress.The geocentric picture that dominated astronomy until the Middle Ages was retrospectively seen as a deadlock, because instead of providing explanations, the model indulged in a description by arbitrary numbers — God-given parameters with which the Almighty seemingly had endowed the planets and their orbits. This increasing complexity, so the anecdote goes, was once commented on in the following terms by King Alfonso el Sabio of Castile: “If the Lord Almighty had consulted me before em­­barking creation thus, I should have recommended something simpler.”Mathematics Opens New HorizonsOn the other hand, not to overly question the limits of current knowledge seems to be deeply rooted in the nature of Homo sapiens: Gods, God-given numbers — whatever cannot be explained here and now — are readily declared to be part of the unfathomable. Note that it was the scientific elite who used to postulate such absolute limits of knowledge, unconsciously perhaps, because conceding that one’s wisdom is insufficient is something uncomfortable to face. Consequently, recognizing the merits of the Ptolemaic world view is necessary for a proper historical apprehension of science, though a dramatic leap of understanding occurred when the Copernican revolution unfolded.Copernicus intuitively understood that the Sun, not the Earth, was the center of planetary orbits, a point of view that immediately simplified the maddeningly complicated picture of motions. Based on Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe’s precise measurements, Johannes Kepler eventually realized that the orbits around the Sun were ellipses rather than circles — a spectacular insight that all of a sudden revealed the essential role of mathematics in the laws of nature. “The book of nature is written in mathematical language”, as Galileo Galilei famously phrased it, after having contributed to the breakthrough of the heliocentric model with his newly developed telescope.It was then Isaac Newton’s turn to complete the revolution with an elaborately constructed system of both mathematical methods and physical concepts that led to an understanding of planetary motion on a highly advanced intellectual level. Inspired by the visionary idea of celestial and earthly motion having the same origin, he was able to prove that the planets followed the course of Kepler’s elliptical orbits exactly — a triumph of the human mind that is certainly unparalleled to this day and marked the beginning of modern natural science.Progress Means SimplicityLet us take a closer look at the crucial elements of this scientific revolution. Frequently mentioned, yet a minor point, is that Kepler’s ellipses described the orbits more precisely than the old Ptolemaic system. More importantly, the prominent role of mathematics in the laws of nature had become evident and led to a unification of earthly and celestial gravity, an unprecedented insight that deeply satisfied the human desire for understanding. The long-lasting search for causes that presumably had started with primitive hypotheses in the Stone Age had culminated in a beautiful way. Methodologically, however, the decisive aspect is that revolutionary breakthroughs always go along with a simplification of the theory. That is why in Newton’s theory, fewer arbitrary assumptions and unexplained parameters are needed — indeed, just one, namely the gravitational constant G named after him (‘Big G’). The latest measurements determine it as 6.673·10–11 m3/(s2 kg).Three hundred years later, in his treatise The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, philosopher Thomas Kuhn brilliantly showed the interplay of surprising new data (anomalies) and the increasingly complicated models invoked to describe them. The more sophistication and the more ad-hoc assumptions such models use, the more unstable they become, eventually collapsing into something much simpler, which is intuitively recognized as the better model. In the old geocentric system, ignorance was disguised by dozens of seemingly God-given numbers. During the revolution, they became obsolete and were replaced by a single parameter: the gravitational constant G. The epistemological progress is close at hand: dramatically fewer arbitrary assumptions had to be made about nature. Newton had, so to speak, sent a good many gods or God-given numbers into retirement and replaced them with a “monotheistic” concept (the gravitational constant) — as we know from history, to the utter displeasure of the real clergy. Henceforth, cardinals and archbishops lost their status as intellectual leaders of humankind and had to cede it to those whom we call scientists today.Constants of Nature — Momentary Limits of KnowledgeThe history of science shows that it is not the names that matter, but the function in the system. Scientists today act as the world’s enlighteners, just like the medieval theologians; what used to be called God, we now call laws of nature. The numbers that show up in these laws today are called constants of nature or even fundamental constants, but epistemologically, they differ very little from the God-given parameters of the epicycle model. There are still limits to our knowledge.Modern physics formulates its laws using a variety of constants of nature (about 20 in cosmology and even more in particle physics) that are not justified by deeper reasons. Since they cannot be explained by our scientific elite, they are considered inexplicable. Needless to say, these parameters represent a much higher level of knowledge than the many “planetary gods,” simply because there are fewer of them, not to mention the degree of mathematical abstraction required to distill them from observation. But, at the end of the day, the transition from gods to fundamental constants represents only gradual progress. We believe in constants of nature because they have resisted all our efforts to explain them: we neither understand their numerical values nor do we know the reason for their sheer existence. Their enigmatic connection to the universe gives them an almost mystical meaning, but let us be clear: constants of nature are the gods of mo­dernity.That means, however, that if we want to make any progress by describing nature in a rational manner, we have to get rid of them. This it is not a philosophical whim of mine, but rather the only consistent interpretation of the history of science. There is historical evidence that revolutionary insights have always been accompanied by simplification in the sense of reducing the number of free parameters.Just one key example: A striking consequence of Maxwell’s equations of 1864 was that electric and magnetic fields could propagate in empty space, without any electric charges nearby. It was probably the German physicist Wilhelm Weber who had the visionary idea that light could be an electromagnetic wave, a bold speculation that was spectacularly confirmed by Heinrich Hertz in 1888. However, the revolution is already contained in the simple formulawhich reduces the number of constants of nature by one. Instead of three independent constants c, ε0 and μ0, only two are left. Few breakthroughs have had such a lasting impact on civilization as this one.Understanding Instead of ExcusesHowever, there remains a lot to be done. Many constants are not explained yet. Take for instance the mysterious numerical value (h being Planck’s constant, c the speed of light)the so-called fine structure constant, another pure number of unknown origin. Richard Feynman commented on it as follows:It’s one of the greatest damn mysteries of physics: a magic number that comes to us with no understanding by man. You might say the ‘hand of God’ wrote that number, and ‘we don’t know how He pushed his pencil.’ We know what kind of a dance to do experimentally to measure this number very accurately, but we don’t know what kind of dance to do on the computer to make this number come out, without putting it in secretly (…). All good theoretical physicists put this number up on their wall and worry about it.[iii]Nowadays it is often argued that 137.035999 is just valid in our universe and there is an infinite number of parallel universes with different fine structure constants… I think this is a bogus explanation.Unlike most contemporary physicists, I am convinced that constants of nature in general do not represent an absolute limit to our knowledge, but mark our currently still limited understanding. Ultimately, these constants of nature are arbitrary, unexplained numbers that have allowed academics to find peace of mind by declaring the unexplained to be unexplainable. We should consider an alternative: The alleged existence of fundamental constants simply means that we have not yet understood the laws of nature down to their origin. Therefore, a rational description of nature cannot tolerate fundamental constants. Gods — whatever we call them — have no place in reality.(A modified part of chapter 1 of my book The Mathematical reality — Why Space and Time are an Illusion)[i] A nice illustration can be found in the videos of Carl Sagan: Carl Sagan on Epicycles, Ptolemy, and Kepler (XXXSDESDEXXX).[ii] Singh (2005), p.56[iii] Feynman, QED — The strange theory of Light and Matter (1985), p.129.The StartupMedium's largest active publication, followed by +723K people.

Mystery of Dark Matter Uncovered by Hubble and VLT,https://medium.com/the-cosmic-companion/mystery-of-dark-matter-uncovered-by-hubble-and-vlt-6f405e80a653?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Space,Science,Dark Matter,Technology,Physics","Our understanding of dark matter just became even more warped — literally.One mystery of dark matter is that it makes up the vast majority of all the matter in the Universe, yet we know surprisingly little about it. This mysterious “something” cannot be seen through light or any other form of electromagnetism — hence the name “dark.” However, dark matter does emit gravitational forces, without which galaxies and clusters of galaxies would fly apart.A new study, based on observations of distant galaxy clusters seen by the Hubble Space Telescope and the Very Large Telescope in Chile reveal dark matter behaves differently than simulations predict, suggesting our models of dark matter may need to be refined.Three of the 11 galaxy clusters seen by astronomers, revealing unexpected behavior from dark matter. Image credits: NASA/ESA/HSST/J. Lotz/M. Postman/STScI/L. Infante (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile)/CLASH Team/HFF TeamIn 1933, astronomer Fritz Zwicky was observing the Coma galaxy cluster when he noticed something unusual — there was not anywhere near enough material to hold the group of galaxies together — yet, they are, somehow, gravitationally bound together. Zwicky suggested the presence of an unseen form of matter, which became known as dark matter.In the 1970’s, Vera Rubin used the 2.1 meter telescope at Kitt Peak outside Tucson, Arizona, studying the rates at which galaxies rotate. What she found showed dark matter resides within the structures galaxies as well as between them.Dark matter also makes up the large-scale infrastructure of the Universe — forming massive ribbons of galaxies that arc across the Cosmos.We now know that the ordinary matter out of which everything familiar is made — stars, planets, cats, and people — makes up just a small fraction of everything out there.Two Eyes are Better than OneThe massive galaxy cluster MACSJ 1206, seen by Hubble and the VLT. Seen within the cluster are distant background galaxies (seen as smeared arcs). These distortions are caused by the dark matter within the cluster. Image credit: NASA, ESA, G. Caminha (University of Groningen), M. Meneghetti (Observatory of Astrophysics and Space Science of Bologna), P. Natarajan (Yale University), the CLASH team, and M. Kornmesser (ESA/Hubble)Because astronomers are unable to see dark matter directly, they study ordinary matter around a target, measuring how it is affected by the invisible source of gravity.One method of measuring dark matter is studying the way light from distant clusters of galaxies bends as it travels past a clump of dark matter. This effect, known as gravitational lensing, can magnify, or even make multiple images from, distant objects.Astronomers recently examined 11 distant galaxy clusters, using the Hubble Space Telescope and the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile. These groups of galaxies are rich with dark matter both within the galaxies (small-scale clumps) and joining the clusters together (large-scale clumps).The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the Very Large Telescope in Chile combined images to make this new discovery about dark matter. Image credit: NASA/ESA/VLT/ESO/L. CalcadaRazor-sharp images from Hubble, combined with advanced spectral analysis from the VLT provided astronomers with the tools they needed to probe these distant galactic clusters. These observations revealed dozens of background targets with their light paths bent by dark matter. By studying these targets, researchers were able to map out the amount and placement of pockets of invisible dark matter.Examination of this data revealed gravitational lensing from small-scale dark matter clumps is 10 times greater than expected.“To me personally, detecting a gnawing gap — a factor of 10 discrepancy in this case — between an observation and theoretical prediction is very exciting… It’s these kinds of gaps and anomalies that have often revealed that either we were missing something in the current theory, or it points the way to a brand-new model,” said Priyamvada Natarajan, astrophysist at Yale University.“In a spiral galaxy, the ratio of dark-to-light matter is about a factor of ten. That’s probably a good number for the ratio of our ignorance to knowledge. We’re out of kindergarten, but only in about third grade.” — Vera RubinResearchers also found images of different sizes nestled inside one another like Russian Matryoshka dolls. This new study could show a gap in astronomers’ understanding of dark matter.“The observed cluster substructures are more efficient lenses than predicted by CDM simulations, by more than [10 times]. We suggest that systematic issues with simulations or incorrect assumptions about the properties of dark matter could explain our results,” researchers describe in an article published in the journal Science.A look at the new findings about dark matter, from NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.Spectroscopic analysis from VLT data allowed astronomers to measure velocities of individual stars within the galaxy clusters. This allowed them to determine the amount of mass, including dark matter, in the distant galactic clusters.“We have done a lot of careful testing in comparing the simulations and data in this study, and our finding of the mismatch persists. One possible origin for this discrepancy is that we may be missing some key physics in the simulations,” said Massimo Meneghetti of the INAF (National Institute for Astrophysics)-Observatory of Astrophysics and Space Science of Bologna in Italy.By bringing together different types of telescopes, examining targets over a range of frequencies (light, radio, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.), astronomers are better able to piece together processes occuring in and around distant targets. The supernova explosion of a distant star, for instance, will radiate in high frequencies — gamma rays and X-rays, before cooling off, radiating in visible light, infrared, and radio waves. By combining observations over all these frequencies, it is possible to develop a comprehensive record of an event.The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, scheduled for launch in the mid-2020's, will examine even more distant galaxy clusters, attempting to unravel the mysteries of dark matter.James Maynard is the founder and publisher of The Cosmic Companion.

In the first case, the books are essentially artistic; in the second case, the art is lost.Do these words resonate with you as they do with me?In British Columbia, the students headed to post-secondary mathematics take precalculus. The pre irks me. Twelve years of maths study and still in the pre stage. As if calculus is the real math.I would love to teach a high school maths class where I have full rein of the curriculum. When the students arrive, they see this on the board:That is my precalculus curriculum. Over the next several weeks, the students learn the notation. They learn about infinite series and partial sums. They learn the factorization of polynomials. Rational expressions. Trigonometry and the unit circle. Even complex numbers. These are all standards in a precalculus education.You may recognize the above as the famous Basel Problem. The curriculum I describe is necessary to understand Euler’s solution. The students finish the course with something to show for it. They are able to articulate a famous proof.Most importantly, the students get to play. They get to struggle with problems.

The most famous of these mass deaths is the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction where our now beloved Tyrannosaurus rex and Velociraptors were killed in the aftermath of an asteroid impact, a treacherous collision with Mexico’s colorful Yucatán Peninsula. Scientists speculate that two other extinctions — the Devonian and the End-Ordovician — could have been the result of supernovas and the gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) created during the explosions.A supernova is a rare event. It happens only once or twice per century in the Milky Way. But a GRB is even rarer still and will occur, at most, once every 10,000 years. Yet it only takes one GRB directed at the Earth to end all life as we know it. The most frightening aspect of these GRBs is that they are part of the electromagnetic spectrum. They move at the speed of light. By the time we saw one approaching Earth there would be nothing we could do to avoid it. Another GRB is expected to hit our planet within half a billion years.Simulation of a star explosion. Image by NASA.But supernovas and their associated GRBs are not inherently terrifying events. They are the sources of creation for every world in the universe. When a massive star runs out of fuel and collapses, the resulting shockwave causes an ultra-bright explosion that we call a supernova. These explosions are the fertile nursery beds for everything from heavy elements to new stars and planets, dimpled lunar bodies forming from the hot wispy gas of the dead star. One massive star dies and makes way for what could be an entirely new system — not unlike our own Solar System replete with us as its curious lifeforms.But it is true that what created us can destroy us.A safe distance from a supernova is 50 to 100 lightyears. If the Earth is any closer we could once again find ourselves going through a mass extinction event from the resulting radiation. The danger of supernovas comes from their gamma and x-rays. These are both part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which also includes visible light and microwaves. However visible light and microwaves are low energy waves and thus they are non-ionizing. The real danger on the spectrum comes from the higher energy ionizing waves: gamma and x-rays.Image by the CDC.To be ionizing means that this radiation alters atoms and molecules by removing electrons. It can cause cancers, mutations, tissue damage, and death in human beings. In fact, some scientists believe organisms on Earth have already been mutated from the effects of distant supernova blasts. This could mean that we — mankind — are a product of mutations stemming from the death of great stars. As for the planet as a whole, radiation from a supernova would have similarly devastating effects.If a supernova were to occur closer than 50 lightyears its x and gamma-rays would destroy our planet’s ozone layer. This is the part of the stratosphere that keeps us safe from the sun’s ultraviolet radiation. There would be drastic changes in climate as the atmosphere of Earth would swell with thick, ugly clouds of nitrous oxide from the ionized nitrogen and oxygen. Now with increased levels of UV radiation able to reach the ground, it would scorch the Earth. More delicate organisms like phytoplankton would die. Phytoplankton are not only an important part of the ocean’s food chain but they also create most of the planet’s oxygen — up to 70% of it.We would be left on a smoldering, suffocating world with little air to breathe and with the ocean as a graveyard for starving animals.An artist’s impression of a GRB hitting the Earth. Image by NASA.GRBs may be rarer than supernovas but they don’t need to be nearly as close. While a safe distance from a supernova is about 50 lightyears, GRBs can be as far as 10,000 lightyears and they would still lead to global catastrophes. These gamma-ray bursts are so powerful that in a single second they create more energy than the sun will in its entire 10 billion years of life. The closest GRB to date was GRB 031203 at 1.3 billion lightyears away, well outside of the Milky Way galaxy.After the gamma and x-rays damage our protective ozone, cosmic rays would follow. They’ll wash over the Earth in a harmful rain of charged particles. The ozone will naturally recover, but not for hundreds of thousands of years. Enough time to have turned the planet into a tomb.It is fortunate for us that there are no stars within a 50 lightyear distance that are destined to go supernova. Our own sun certainly won’t explode, though its expansion in the future will make it difficult to continue living on this world. Scientists don’t believe we’re at risk from either a supernova or a GRB. But the fact that these events may have contributed to mass extinctions in the past does put us in an uneasy position.It puts into perspective that we are a part of something much larger. Our civilizations are at the whim of natural disasters both on this planet and in this galaxy. If it is true that each person’s actions can affect the universe then it is also true that the universe affects all life. Sometimes in a tender way — by sending small meteorites tumbling to the planet’s snowy surface — sometimes in a significant way, such as with the mutations which may have allowed us to become who we are. And sometimes, though we can’t be sure just how often, in a deadly way where the slate for all life on Earth is wiped clean once again.Predictwhere the future is writtenFollow832 3 Sign up for Predict NewsletterBy PredictMonthly updates on science and technology shaping our future. Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

Is There A Parallel Universe Where Time Runs Backwards?,https://medium.com/predict/is-there-a-parallel-universe-where-time-runs-backwards-41a0ab22c53c?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"Science,NASA,Space,Physics,Nature","Way back in April 2020, right when the Coronavirus was causing worldwide lockdown, a story about an astonishing scientific breakthrough was doing the rounds. The NewScientist was one of the first to publish it in an article titled “We may have spotted a parallel universe going backwards in time”. But was this just an outlandish story, or a genuine discovery?Well, to cut a long story short, it was both. But the discovery was not what you might think.This story came from two sources: A NASA high altitude balloon experiment called ALITA that records high energy particle activity in the Antarctic atmosphere (otherwise known as cosmic rays) and a paper entitled ‘Upgoing ANITA events as evidence of the CPT symmetric universe’ that tried to describe the puzzling data collected by the balloon.ALITA experiment in the Antarctic — NASAALITA’s job is to detect these high energy particles and what direction they are travelling in. As these particles are Neutrinos, it is damn difficult to detect them, so the instruments typically pick up a lot of noise. To find the genuine Neutrino events in amongst this noise the data has to be thoroughly filtered.The NASA scientists expected the rays to be heading towards the ground, after all, they do originate from space (hence the name cosmic rays). So they filtered the data accordingly, but when they did, they saw almost no readings. But, when they looked at the noise that had been filtered out, they saw that ALITA had detected several events where the particles appeared to be going backwards — originating from the ground going out into space.According to the NewScientist and several other prominent media outlets, this could not be explained by our current understanding of physics, and there was only one reasonable explanation for these peculiar readings which had NASA scratching their heads.This eye-opening explanation came from a paper (sited above) which gives a possible solution to the results seen by ALITA. As no source for the Neutrinos can be found on the ground, they needed to find a way in which Neutrinos can go backwards in time. They did this by having an anti-Universe that started at the Big Bang along with our Universe, but this anti-Universe’s time runs backwards. According to this paper, these events are us interacting with this backwards running Universe. So when we see these Neutrinos, they are actually coming from our twin.This sounds utterly mental and a giant leap to make from some particles going in the wrong direction. But this conclusion is based on our understanding of the Standard Model of particles and CPT Symmetry. Sadly, these well tested theories weren’t quite enough to make this solution work entirely, so they did need to use a recent unproven hypothesis about Dark Matter & the Higgs Boson.The Standard Model — Wiki PDSo, while this does use some untested framework to explain the ALITA events, the maths and data all checkout. Making it is at the very least plausible.So that must be the conclusion, right? No other explanations have come close to explaining these strange events! We must have a parallel backwards Universe twin.Well, sadly, this is the outlandish story, not the genuine discovery. While this paper suggests this could be evidence for a backwards twin Universe, it is not presented as a be-all and end-all solution. It was merely one possible way to explain the results.What? The Media not telling the whole truth and twisting a story to be more enticing… What a shock…To solve the problem correctly, you have to look at all possible solutions. This is the craziest solution and not the most likely solution. Sadly, some media outlets chose to present this as the sole and best-fitting solution, which it isn’t.There is a smorgasbord of valid explanations, such as regular misreadings by the ballon, Neutrinos interacting with the ice in ways we yet don’t understand and even a possible source for the particles beneath the ice. The fact of the matter is that countless explanations are just as, if not more vali, than the backwards Universe.Amazingly these un-reported explanations hide a possible discovery that would eclipse the parallel Universe hypothesis.You can see this potential discovery in a paper entitled ‘A search for IceCube events in the direction of ANITA neutrino candidates’ here, the scientist tried to find similar backwards Neutrinos in data from another Antarctic Neutrino detector called IceCube. Their results suggest that there could be several different sources for these Neutrinos and that further study is required. Basically, the experiments weren’t accurate enough to pinpoint the exact nature of these Neutrinos.But the paper did go on to mention that, if the current trend of results continues with more accurate data, we will need to re-write Particle Physics!This isn’t new though, Neutrinos have been confusing scientists for years.We have a plethora of evidence that Neutrinos behave differently to how our particle models predict. One of the newest bits of evidence comes from the T2K experiment, who recently discovered that Neutrinos and Anti-Neutrinos change ‘flavours’ differently (flavour in particles is just a different type of the same particle). This could be our first glimpse as to why the Universe has more matter than anti-matter as it is the first time that an anti-matter particle has been seen to act differently to its counterpart.Another weird Neutrino behaviour is that they have been observed to have mass. Yet our models predict that they should be massless particles. It doesn’t seem like our theory is doing a good job with Neutrinos, does it?ALITA’s backwards Neutrinos could be evidence of yet more weird Neutrino behaviour that our theories can’t predict. This here is the genuine discovery or at least a potential one, and it could be way more exciting than a parallel Universe.The Standard Model is the theory that explains all known particles and their interactions really well. It has accurately predicted literally trillions of particle experiments, particularly in particle colliders. But it has some glaring holes that it struggles to answer, mainly about Neutrinos.The Large Hadron Collider at Cern where experiments have verified the Standard Model — CernThese odd particles have been challenging to study, as they so very rarely interact with anything, but recently we have started to detect more and more. This is teaching us a lot about how these elusive particles actually behave, and it looks like our current theory is entirely wrong, at least when it comes to Neutrinos.The data gathered by ALITA can be used in conjunction with hundreds more Neutrinos experiments (like T2K) to either tweak the Standard Model for it to work better or replace it entirely with a better fitting theory.This is precisely what the paper ‘A search for IceCube events in the direction of ANITA neutrino candidates’ suggests is needed.Adjusting or replacing a theory may sound simple, but it can open up a whole new world of science that until now, we have only been able to dream of.Just as when Einstein created General Relativity and replaced Newtons Theory of Gravity, it allowed us to predict black holes, gravitation lensing and time dilation, which have now all been observed and proven. The re-write of the Standard Model could also bring new predictions to light.Albert Einstein — Wiki PDSo by creating a better theory of particles, we might be able to use it to predict phenomena way beyond Neutrinos. We could be able to predict what Dark Matter is, what Dark Energy is, answer the Matter-Antimatter Paradox and maybe even discover if the Graviton particle exists (the theoretical force-carrying particle of gravity).If we could prove or disprove the Graviton, then it will pave the way to create a theory of Quantum Gravity and ultimately a unified theory of everything.We need to run a lot more experiments like ALITA and other Neutrino based experiments before we can overturn the Standard Model. After all, it has done incredibly well as a theory for all the other particles, and there is no need to throw out the baby with the bathwater.But the bizarre events seen by ALITA, T2K and other Neutrino experiments could very well be a stepping stone to one of the most significant scientific breakthroughs of this century. We could be on the brink of re-writing the Standard Model.So while media outlets like the NewScientist slightly lead people astray (I appreciate they need good headlines to sell subscriptions), I think they missed the bigger story here. Solving the mystery of weird Neutrino behaviour could also solve some of the biggest mysteries in the Universe and ALITA’s data will be a part of that revolution.So we probably didn’t see a parallel Universe in the Antarctic, if you take the bigger view, then it is far more likely that Neutrinos were just acting weird like they always seem to do. There still is a very slim chance it could be our backwards twin, even if it is very very unlikely.I don’t know about you, but the possibility of creating a theory of everything is far more exciting than a parallel Universe which sends us the occasional backwards particle. So, I will be keeping an eye out for any more data, papers or experiments that are hunting down the cause of these weird Antarctic Neutrinos. Who knows, it might just revolutionise physics.Predictwhere the future is writtenFollow235 6 Sign up for Predict NewsletterBy PredictMonthly updates on science and technology shaping our future. Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

The Bootstrap Paradox,https://medium.com/whiteboard-to-infinity/the-bootstrap-paradox-4db69dbc2932?source=tag_archive---------4-----------------------,"Time Travel,Science Fiction,Science,Physics,SciFi","Imagine you’re walking down the street and you see a blue telephone box. You’re a fan of a certain long-running British sci-fi show, so you look inside. There, you find a computer that lets you select a specific time and place somewhere on Earth. To your amazement, you type in the Cretaceous period and step outside to find a T. Rex. You excitedly spend the next few hours galavanting around time and space until you decide to go home. To avoid being late for work, you land the time machine a minute before you found it. You also leave it in the same place you found it, because you’d rather not be on the bad side of whoever owns it. As you walk away, you turn back and see your past self getting in the box. The box disappears, and despite taking that same route to work everyday after your adventure, you never see it again.You come to the conclusion that your past self must have gone on the same adventure as you. Then, you realize that the time machine was left for you to find by yourself. Immediately the question arises: who built the time machine to begin with? Where did it come from? This story is an example of the Bootstrap Paradox, where an item or piece of information travels back in time and effectively creates itself. The name is derived from the idea of pulling yourself up from your own bootstraps, which is of course impossible. The paradox arises when you consider that the item or information in question has no discernible origin. It appears from seemingly nowhere. From a linear perspective of time, this seems to violate causality. However, if you think about time more cyclically, no paradox arises. The time machine came from where it always was. It exists simply because it exists. And as we’ll see, the physics of our universe may actually allow certain interpretations of this paradox to occur. So why don’t we see matter and information constantly pouring in from the future? Where are all the time travelers?To understand why we don’t see time travelers and bootstrap paradoxes in our day-to-day lives, we need to understand how a bootstrap paradox would actually work in our universe. Going back to our example from the beginning, we know there’s nothing present before the time machine first appears to explain why it exists. Its existence implies that physical things can just materialize randomly, which seems to violate the first law of thermodynamics, the second law of thermodynamics, and the law of conservation of information. But if you dive into what these laws actually state, you find that our paradoxical thought experiment need not violate any of them.The First Law of ThermodynamicsThe first law of thermodynamics states that the energy of a closed system must remain constant. No energy can be created or destroyed. We know the same is true of mass as a result of E=mc². Therefore, the closed system of our universe shouldn’t allow any energy or matter to materialize out of nothingness. This fact seems like it should prevent the appearance of time travelers. There are a few phenomena in physics that seem to violate conservation of energy, such as the expansion of the universe and the quantum uncertainty relation between energy and time, but none of them are likely to produce spontaneous time machines. Luckily, a time traveler might not need to violate conservation of energy at all. Why not? Wormholes, but not the ones you’re familiar with.I mentioned in my post on the TARDIS from Doctor Who that our universe may be full of tiny wormholes with openings smaller than a Planck length, the smallest unit of length we currently understand. This idea is called the quantum foam.If the quantum foam exists, every point in space and time may be connected to every other point. Therefore, any separation between events may be arbitrary, and all of time can be thought of as happening simultaneously. Not only does this open the door for travel between points in time, it suggests that time itself may be an emergent property of the universe rather than a fundamental one. If so, any apparent transfer of energy from one point in time to another may just be an illusion. For example, a time machine arriving in the past doesn’t introduce new energy to the universe. It just relocates existing energy. Reorganizing matter and energy brings us to our second physics hurdle to justify a bootstrap paradox…The Second Law of ThermodynamicsHere’s where things get tricky. The second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy of a closed system must increase over time. Entropy is a complicated thing, but you can think of it as a measure of how evenly spread out the energy of a system is. In a system at maximum entropy, every point in space has the same amount of energy present as every other point. Decreasing entropy means increasing the difference in energy between certain points. A decrease in entropy is what needs to happen for our time machine to materialize in the past. As far as we know, the universe is a closed system. Therefore, decreases in the local entropy of any region of space must use up some of the energy from another region of space. This energy doesn’t vanish, it just becomes more spread out as it’s used to decrease the entropy of a certain location. So while the entropy of that region goes down, the overall entropy of the universe still goes up.The second law comes into play when you trace the timeline of the paradox from the perspective of the object or information traveling through time. Let’s go back to our example from earlier. The timeline from an outside observer’s perspective looks like this:But if we follow the time machine’s experience as the loop repeats, we notice something important. The time machine should eventually break.The second law of thermodynamics dictates that eventually any object must decay as its entropy increases and its matter and energy spreads out. The same is true for our time machine. If the time machine decays further each time it reappears in the past, then it isn’t just experiencing the same timeline over and over again. It’s hopping from timeline to timeline until it eventually breaks. This concept fits well with the Many-Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, where the universe is composed of many different possible timelines. And if the second law of thermodynamics demands that the time loop of a bootstrap paradox eventually ends, it stands to reason that the loop must also have a beginning. That’s because if the loop ends with the time machine having some finite entropy, the point where the machine was at its minimum entropy couldn’t have been infinitely far into its own past. The entropy of the machine could only have increased from zero or higher.You might imagine that the loop begins with someone actually building the time machine, but that wouldn’t make sense. If someone else left behind the time machine you found, then when your future self arrives in the past, there would be two time machines. No. For the timeline to stay consistent, the time machine has to materialize from seemingly nowhere with a version of you inside it!Initially, you may think the second law of thermodynamics rules out time machines and people spontaneously forming. For the most part, you’d be right. However, the second law of thermodynamics is statistical. The overall entropy of the universe must increase, but small dips in the entropy of certain regions are to be expected. In principle, any arbitrarily large dip in local entropy is possible. (Although, larger dips are less likely to occur.) Therefore, it is possible for complex systems like living beings or maybe even time machines to form spontaneously given enough time. You can learn more about why that is from the video above or my post on quantum resurrection.Can Quantum Physics Save a Simulated Universe from Being Unplugged?Quantum Immortality and Quantum Resurrectionmedium.comThe Many-Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics claims that any possible chain of events should occur in its own timeline. Therefore, there should be countless timelines where the conditions for a bootstrap paradox emerge. A random dip in entropy starts the loop, and time travel carries the object or information that was spontaneously generated from one timeline to the next until it naturally decays beyond recognition.Side Note: Information is just as subject to the second law as matter and energy. A message being sent back in time over and over again would be repeatedly misread or corrupted until it was unrecognizable.So far we’ve established that the second law allows for bootstrap paradoxes to occur — provided the time travel involved is physically possible — so long as the information being sent through time eventually decays. Real bootstrap paradoxes wouldn’t be paradoxes at all. They’d just be strange quirks of the vast universe that arise as the result of its probabilistic nature. However, there’s one more apparent issue we need to address…The Conservation of InformationAs I’ve talked about before on this blog, quantum physics prohibits the creation or deletion of information. The universe always has the same amount of information encoded in its wavefunction, the mathematical element that defines the possible states of a quantum system. I highly recommend watching the video above to learn why this is. The conservation of information is relevant for this discussion because it seems like it should prohibit the bootstrap paradox. If information like the structure of a time machine or the memories of a person just appeared spontaneously, wouldn’t that violate this fundamental law of physics? Actually, no. The conservation of quantum information means that all the possible states of the universe are contained within its wavefunction. In the Many-Worlds interpretation, the information about these states are divided among many different timelines. So even the information about highly unlikely events — like the spontaneous appearance of people and time machines — has been present within the universe since its beginning. Those events were always a possibility, therefore no new information enters the universe when they occur.As you may have noticed, we’ve been talking a lot about the Many-Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. That’s partially because it’s the interpretation which best resolves the bootstrap paradox. However, the Many-Worlds interpretation may also help us answer our big question: why don’t we see time travelers everywhere?Many-Worlds and the Anthropic PrincipleThe anthropic principle is a way of accounting for our own selection bias when making predictions about our universe. It asserts that we should expect to find ourselves living in a universe capable of producing observers. After all, we couldn’t exist in a universe inhospitable to observers like us. The refined anthropic principle builds on this idea. It claims that we should expect to find ourselves in the most typical type of universe capable of producing observers. That claim is equally logical, since a typical universe is by definition more likely to be observed than an atypical one. Applying the refined anthropic principle to the multiple timelines of the Many-Worlds theory demonstrates why we shouldn’t expect to encounter time travelers at this point in our evolution.If Many-Worlds is the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics, then the universe is split up into countless possible timelines. As we’ve established, some of these timelines might host time travelers and the spontaneous appearance of information. However, our understanding of time is very linear, so events like these don’t really fit with the way our brains evolved. We fundamentally understand cause as preceding effect, so the paradoxes created by time travel are hard to comprehend. According to the anthropic principle, beings who observe time linearly should expect to find themselves in a timeline that allows for their minds to evolve that way. That would be one where relatively few, if any, time travel paradoxes occur. If we lived in a timeline where paradoxes occurred more frequently, we’d likely have evolved to better understand them.The refined anthropic principle adds that we should expect to find ourselves in the most typical of all the timelines that support our narrow view of the spacetime continuum. The conditions for time travel paradoxes are exceedingly rare. Therefore, a typical timeline would be one where paradoxes don’t occur. That’s exactly the type of timeline we appear to inhabit. We don’t see time travelers or any of the paradoxes they bring with them. As a result, we’ve developed a fairly simple intuition about cause and effect.One issue you may have with this explanation is that it excludes the fact that our intuition is forever changing. We understand more about the true nature of time now than ever before. That alone doesn’t imply we should be seeing more time travelers, as even a species who can comprehend the implications of time travel would most likely live in a timeline without it. However, it could very well be that as our understanding of the universe continues to grow, we begin to see more of it. If Many-Worlds is correct, we may one day develop the technology to travel between different timelines. If so, we could become a race akin to the time lords from Doctor Who. Our galavanting between alternate realities would undoubtedly lead to more run-ins with fellow time travelers and encounters with paradoxes. We’d gain greater understanding of these phenomena that once perplexed us and develop a new intuition about how the universe works. Like any traveler, we’d learn about the places we visit and have experiences unlike any we’d have at home.Doctor Who incorporates this hypothesis beautifully across its tenure. In the episode The Parting of Ways, a human named Rose Tyler uses the TARDIS to send a warning to her past self. However, she only thought to do that because she had already received that warning. This episode offers a prime example of how exposure to working time travel would inevitably lead to an ordinary person like Rose experiencing more and more paradoxes until they began to feel commonplace. Similar bootstrap paradoxes occur in episodes like Blink, Before the Flood, and the fantastic mini-episode Space and Time. Another famous example is the ending of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.In conclusion, not all interpretations of the bootstrap paradox violate the laws of physics(assuming the quantum foam exists, multiple timelines exist, and some form of backwards time travel is in fact possible). Even so, linearly temporal beings such as we shouldn’t expect to find ourselves overrun with time travelers and paradoxes. Their presence would have radically altered our mental evolution and prevented us from evolving the way we did. If concepts like multiple timelines are valid, then we could one day set out into the multiverse to find time travelers rather than waiting for them to find us. If we do, the types of paradoxes saturating our science fiction today may become utterly mundane.Works CitedMoffat, Steven, et al. Doctor Who, BBC, 26 Mar. 2005.Christoforou, Peter.

The Problem With Time Is Physicists,https://medium.com/socyc/the-problem-with-time-is-physicists-5c9c06bee99e?source=tag_archive---------5-----------------------,"Physics,Philosophy,Time,Organization,Society","‘Time’ has become a virtual black hole, if not a rathole.Thought I’d never be smart enough to study physics, yet I did. Growing up in a ‘textile family’, I made up my mind rather late, choosing science over trade. Armed by belief and curiosity, I picked up my life and started studying math on my own. It gave me the confidence needed to complete a prep year that gave access to the study of Applied Physics (B.Eng). Doing what I liked, I learned what I really was: a bit of a nerd who, at times, aced math-heavy exams while all of my fellow students failed. I had a knack for quantifying the behavior of complex mechanical engineering systems, so it seemed. This must have been the reason why I received an invite to write my final thesis at the ‘cybernetics laboratory’ of Delft University, the place where they designed and tested cockpit simulators for pilots, among other things. I was thrilled at the thought of learning about these.Standard ModelWhen I announced myself on day one, my academic supervisor handed me coldly four sheets of paper. The first sheet contained a crude diagram next to a chart. It appeared to be an empirically designed device to measure the oil level in harbor storage tanks. “How boring…”, I thought. The device was made up of mechanical components inside and outside the tank. Basically, a float inside the tank communicated the oil level via a cable to a pulley. The rotation of the pulley’s axle was transferred to an axle outside, without an opening in the tank’s wall, by means of magnets, one inside and one outside — probably for security purposes. The other three sheets contained a table with physical dimensions and charts that hinted at possible irregularities. If the oil level would change abruptly, the magnetic coupling might no longer function and/or the float might come loose from the cable. This meant that these components together could behave as one system but… not always.“Your job is to simulate this on an analog computer and analyze its behavior.” He pointed to his office door. “You’ll find the computer at the end of the corridor, left.” “Is that all?” I asked, flabbergasted. He nodded. “Oh, yes, you’ll share the office next door with our research fellows.” So, out of his office I went and had a look at the analog computer. I had never seen one before. It was an Hitachi, a big box of approximately 120 cm wide, 80 cm high, and 60 cm deep, resting on a table — its front face with plugin holes. A Japanese engineer happened to be cleaning and calibrating it, white gloves and all. I noticed the instruction manual on the same table. Fifty odd years ago, digital computers were rare and not fast enough to do such simulations real time. Analog computers were. Simplistically, you’d plug in your mathematical equations using electronic components representing your equation’s items or operators, such as summators and integrators. Logic components would help you jump from one equation to another when certain conditions developed. I needed to collect my thoughts — I was given 12 weeks to do the job.1974, the ‘standard model’ of a mechanical oil-level measuring device.The next day, I made a start with the mathematical description of the mechanical components, one component at the time. Beginning with the float — the place where the force of an oil-level change would be felt first, I developed both static and dynamic models— the float moving up and down, the other components rotating. Components might not just move or rotate but also accelerate due to sudden oil-level changes. The description of motion and acceleration, therefore, necessarily hinged on second-order differential equations. Depending on the force of an oil-level change, the equations would change. The components might no longer behave as one system — the float coming loose from the cable, the magnets failing to trace each other. The preparations involved normalizing my equations. I had to make sure the outcomes would not damage the Hitachi’s sensitive electronic gear. I also needed to normalize matters, time wise, to mimic the speed of the actual device.Origin of OrderI handed in my thesis after 10 weeks. My analysis showed the vulnerabilities of the device, its predictable and less predictable or non-linear behavior. I had forgotten about its ugliness, having been immersed in the mathematics involved and loving every minute of it. Yet, as a graduate now, I was at a crossroads. Doing a master’s and a PhD was one of the options. It was 1974. Substantial progress was being made with the Standard Model, an immensely complex model that quantifies how the interaction of three basic forces of nature shapes what, scientists believe, are fundamental particles. Many exceptionally gifted physicists had contributed to it —many still do. I had produced what could indeed be called the ‘standard model’ of a mechanical oil-level measuring device, its components being its ‘fundamental particles’ each with strictly confined behavior and subjected to Newtonian forces only. The question was whether I’d take the corridor left again, toward the narrow, quantitative end of reality—possibly focusing on the probabilistic behavior of the very small. Or, should I take the corridor right, toward the exit and the wide, societal end of reality, which hinges on probabilistic behavior too?I developed a hunch, against the odds, so it seemed, that all we see in our world can be reconciled without the need of getting down to levels where particles and physicists rule — The Next Scientific RevolutionI turned right and joined industry, realizing all too well that such quantified standard models would be out of the question in this world. Even so, foolishly maybe, I didn’t let go my faint hunch that one could get a similarly revealing (albeit initially less-quantified) grasp of reality going my way. Working as corporate consultant eventually, I continued pursuing my academic interest and finished a PhD in organizational sociology — my instinct firmly remaining that of a physicist. My aim was to configure a practical understanding of how ‘order’, in the shape of, say, a new company, emerges and evolves — my story here. The research of the Belgian chemist and Nobel laureate, Ilya Prigogine, served as key reference point. Focusing on the thermodynamics involved, Prigogine investigated why, in a thin layer of liquid that is heated uniformly from below, order arises from chaotic molecule behavior all by itself. Order (that is, molecules repeatedly following certain paths to transport energy from the bottom to the surface — a division of labor of a kind) increases the efficiency of the transformation of energy needed. This means that the cost of energy transformation (entropy) in such cases is minimized, a point argued by Erwin Schrödinger in What is Life — I investigate this here.ComplexityInside companies, the repeated behavior of employees along certain paths increases the efficiency of the transformation of ideas and materials into products too. Repeated human behavior actually shapes societal institutions this way. Complexity theory sheds light on this. When repeated behaviors resonate and reinforce one another, phenomena such as open chaos, stochastic resonance, attractor forming, and itinerant attractors dominate the emergence of complexity. These four serial phenomena conveniently demarcate stages of complexity emergence — background here. Not much of what is written about complexity puts a finger on what it really is or how to imagine it.Cycle of physical and societal reality emergence = ‘time holon’ or ‘tilon’.Societal realities unfold much slower than realities in the quantum world. They expose how organizational complexity increases when the division of labor progresses followed by the entanglement of behaviors that this entices— details here. As discussed by the Scottish economist, Adam Smith, a division of labor helps improve the efficiency of a company. It does so by making the behavior of its workers follow paths of least action. Rather than choosing the fastest or shortest paths, human organizations, like nature, favor paths that take the least energy contextually, that is, depending on what environmental constraints allow at any point in time — more here. This is also what the pursuit of organizational efficiency is essentially about… mending environmental constraints. When plotting the waxing and waning of the division of labor versus that of the entanglement of behaviors, a clock face with quarters appears in the crosshairs of these axes. This clock face shows the four-stage development of organizational complexity or order. The four earlier-mentioned complexity-theory phenomena fit right in. Complexity, in other words, is the degree of the division of labor and behavioral entanglement (division of labor equating to established paths of least action), a clockwork, really, of which the hands run between rise and decline. It shows, the ensuing thermodynamic states of emergence of both physical and societal realities. Because the conditions differ each quarter, you can actually tell what ‘time’ it is, if you’d know what these conditions are — details and examples here.Complexity = clockwork of division of labor and behavioral entanglement.TilonNot only because of Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle (which hints at the wave-like nature of particles and, as recent research shows, even, molecules), ‘every-thing’ can be reduced to a choreography of repeated patterns of behavior (on contextual least-action paths) that shapes the observable features — details here. In other words, things, no matter how solid they may appear, are really no-things. This implies a change in our perception of physical and societal reality. We typically perceive our world as a hierarchy of “holons”, things that are both a whole and part of another whole, such as strings, particles, atoms, molecules, cells, people, thoughts, organizations, classifications — Arthur Koestler introduces the term in his book The Ghost In The Machine. In such a world, complexity boils down to some spacial measure of variety. We live, however, in an emergent world with a thermodynamic impetus of least action that makes it unfold from moment to moment. Behavior patterns on contextual paths of least action persistently shape the physical and societal realities that we observe. These realities, including our own, are subject to wandering environmental constraints — climate change is one example in a chain of environmental constraints that are themselves emergent. The reality of a holon, therefore, is defined by its emergent signature, its ‘time holon’ or ‘tilon’, so to speak. The tilon virtually delineates complexity, that is, the clockwork of four thermodynamic states, each with specific conditions. So, rather than living in a hierarchy of holons, we live in a hierarchy of tilons. Tilons are nature’s signature of emergence and causality. Like the Austrian physicist, Ernst Mach, envisaged, the hierarchy of tilons shows how realities relate to all other realities dynamically. At the same level in a tilon hierarchy, tilons may “spookily” run in parallel. Could this explain “non-locality”?Not just limited to human behavior, ‘tilons’ also describe the emergence of quasiparticles or anyones involving the collective behavior of electrons.TimeFor many years, I have studied the emergence of societal phenomena, such as companies. “Is there a way of comparing organizational conditions across companies?”, I kept asking myself, hoping to predict their common needs. Leaders often insisted that their company was different. The statement, “We have unique problems and need unique solutions…”, is still ringing in my ears. My findings, across a wide range of industries, showed quite the opposite. Companies, even nations, traverse stages with similar conditions — examples here. In due course, I learned that stages and stage conditions hinted at the tilon — nature’s clockwork of physical and societal reality emergence. I was puzzled, nonetheless. Some companies are short-lived while others keep churning out products, seemingly forever. Also stage durations appear to vary. What does that make of the stage parallels that I had unveiled? Time or duration is meaningless, so it seemed. Like in the world of business, the arrow of time in the quantum world appears to be meaningless too. It’s difficult to tell ‘what time it is’ if you can only measure either the position or momentum of a particle (Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle). To paraphrase the Dutch physicist, Gerard ‘t Hooft, “we are unable to observe the microscopic details...” There is so much going on that you can’t see. In absolute vacuum, particles may spontaneously pop in and out of existence (byproduct of the Casimir effect). Again, this is no different from the world of business where companies pop in and out of existence inexplicably too (beware of how-to-book hindsights). As every venture capitalist can tell you, it is very difficult, if not impossible to predict which business idea will make it in the end. Only a small percentage of the investment proposals they buy into comes to fruition. It’s equally difficult to bet on a company’s lifespan. Environmental constraints may develop and hit businesses and leaders in the face before they even realize it.Time, itself, doesn’t say anything about the state of emergence or ontology of the thing that it describes. You’d establish the duration of an event by translating it into a shorter, highly regular reference event — moon months, days, pendulum swings, hours, minutes, seconds, you name it. The benefit of doing this is that you can compare the duration of events that involve different things. To decide whether to travel to a destination by either ship or camel, you’d translate the journey for each means of transportation into, say, days first. Having expressed both ways of traveling in days, you can make up your mind — time wise. Of course, time or duration is meaningless if you’d like to know the state of emergence of either ship or camel. Nonetheless, time has played such a crucial role in physics that it has evolved into a holon-like reality in the mind of some physicists— nuggets of time or time crystals might even interact. Considering that we, sapiens, invented time by our very choice of reference events (days, hours, minutes, seconds, crystals), it is confusing to see it being turned it into some virtual building brick of nature. No matter which reference event you choose to calculate time, it will not say something about the ontology of reality — more here. It simply lacks the thermodynamic impetus needed to nudge the emergence of reality forward at every level of the tilon hierarchy from moment to moment — possibly in an analog way.Hard to distinguish digitized from analog recordings after digital computers caught up with analog ones. Does that mean our world is made up of bits?CausalityIn The End of Certainty, Prigogine confides to his readership that he made a rather impulsive statement during a speech at a colloquium in Moscow: “Time precedes existence…” “Which kind of time could that be?”, I asked myself.What really matters is ‘ontological’ duration of creation and emergence.Prigogine admitted that he was greatly influenced by the ideas of the French philosopher and Nobel laureate, Henri Bergson, probably as much the British mathematician and philosopher, Alfred North Whitehead. Bergson, in his book, Time and Free Will, lays out the ideas that Prigogine was referring to. Bergson proposes to separate the everyday version of time — the version that physicists typically use to quantify motion based on the repetition of some reference event — from ‘another version’ of duration. “The more deeply we study the nature of time, the better we understand that duration [also] means invention, creation of forms, and continuous elaboration of the absolute new.” Whitehead refers quite succinctly to Bergson’s new version of duration as “the passage of nature.” In view of my analysis here, the tilon, as nature’s signature of emergence and causality with its thermodynamic impetus, appears to fit the requirements and, thus, qualifies as “passage of nature”. The tilon is about ontological duration… of creation and emergence.A New PhysicsCompared with ‘regular time’, tilons and the four stages that shape them have so far not much been quantified. Of course, they should be… In that sense, regular time, derived from the repetition of a reference event, has had a head start and, as a result, plays a predominant role when predicting events in the physical world — perhaps too dominant a role, I’d argue. When regular time is hidden from view, such as in the quantum world, physicists are inclined to fill its space, “powerfully determined by expectations build upon past commerce” as they are. One way is to play ‘poker physics’, using statistics to predict the occurrence of events. Which cards might nature throw on the table when it is its turn, and its next, and next? Another way is to explain our world unfolding without time. In The End of Time, Julian Barbour, proposes to do so. Barbour suggested taking ‘time’ out of Schrödinger’s wave function. He called the resulting timeless world “configuration space”, an imaginary space with all possible wave configurations. The question is how nature would find its way through this labyrinth of possible futures without a thermodynamic impetus. Remember “the least action principle” involves motion, which hinges on time. Similar proposals fall on the same sword: in a fifth, timeless dimension where entropy is constant nothing happens. Then there is the ingenious idea of letting the universe weave itself using a simple spinning rule, something that Stephen Wolfram proposes. Which rule might do, without a computer?It’s time (oops) to take a step back. Configuration space, timeless dimensions, and rule-based spinning of universes are all entrenched in space. Apart from lacking a thermodynamic impetus, these ideas fail to describe the reality of business, society, and thought. What kind of a theory of ‘everything’ is that? A “theory of process” is needed that predicts our world, including its spatial and non-spatial stuff, even from before it actually emerged. Prigogine’s hunch was right. The tilon, as nature’s clockwork of creation, is the kind of time that precedes existence. We may, in fact, not just need a new kind of time but also a new kind of physics. We’d better start weaving the fabric of tilons, now…SoCycFocus in a spinning worldFollow64 1 Sign up for SoCyc News from the EditorBy SoCycSoCyc Update/stories with breakaway insights into success, society, science, our AI future. Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

Formation of Fields and Their Roles in the Working of the Universe- Study of the Vacuum is the New Frontier of Kowledge,https://medium.com/@MahmoudNafousi/formation-of-fields-and-their-roles-in-the-woking-of-the-universe-study-of-the-vacuum-is-the-new-7fcc77a8a2d5?source=tag_archive---------6-----------------------,"Physics,Gravity,Electromagnetism,Quantum Physics,Universe","The study of physics is mostly the study of different types, formation and interactions between fields. The two fundamental operators’ intrinsic velocity, spins and other binary characteristics are. responsible for the creation of the different fields. Fields are geometrical excitations within the spacetime matrix. We will endeavor to show how different fields are formed and manifested, and how they interact with each other at a fundamental level.1) Spacetime matrix as the unified fieldWe have postulated in other published articles that the spacetime matrix represents the unified field referred to under different theories in physics. It is the platform in which the entire universe manifests itself. In a simplified view, the unified field is the consequence of spacetime being filled with interconnected vibrating balls and springs. Fields’ vibrations propagate throughout space and are governed by the appropriate wavefunction for the particular field equations. All fields are quantized as they are composed of such balls-springs combinations i.e. spacetime particles (SPs). This means that the strength of a field at any point is determined by the relative density of the balls-springs ratio to that of the standard vacuum ratio. At the most basic level, the unified field (the vacuum) at each point in space is a simple harmonic oscillator, and its quantization places a quantum harmonic oscillator at each point. Each such point in the unified field represents a location code. It also acts independently as a nano-clock generating its own proper microseconds, which represent the time dimension code for each interaction at that point in space. The spatial code and the time code of a space particle represent a unique spacetime code for any subatomic interaction.Local excitations of the unified field at the SPs level lead to the manifestations of the different subatomic particles’ quantum fields’ with their specific wavefunctions. According to this postulation the vacuum has a structure, so all calculations of quantum field theory and force fields must be made in relation to this model of the vacuum. The vacuum has, implicitly, all of the properties that a particle may have: spin, polarization, momentum, energy and charge. On average, these properties cancel out, except energy. The vacuum is, after all, “empty” in this sense.Based on the above postulation, a field is a physical quantity, represented by a number or tensor, that has a value at each relevant point in spacetime. Therefore the study of physics is the study of fields and the study of quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics of the interactions between the composing two operators, at different points in the local spacetime, responsible for the manifestation of the fields.Vector force fields describe a non-contact force acting on particles at various positions in spacetime. A force field is defined as a region in space in which each point is affected by a force. Newton’ gravitation law and Coulomb’s electrostatic law are both measures of such force fields.The Higgs field (the unified field) is assumed in this work to be the spacetime matrix. When the SPs are at their rest state geometry they represent the vacuum. When they are in states of excitations (changed geometry) they compose the different force fields. For example the drop in the SPs’ radii lengths lead to the creation of the gravitational fields. In the case of electromagnetic fields, the SPs turn into pairs of virtual electrons and positrons. They interact with each other and with the charged particles responsible for their excitation. This leads to the emissions and absorptions of virtual photons which act as the electromagnetic force carriers.2) Formation of fieldsAccording to current literatureIn particle physics, unified field is an attempt to describe all fundamental forces and the relationships between elementary particles in terms of a single theoretical framework. Forces can be described by fields that mediate interactions between separate objects. In the mid-19th century James Clerk Maxwell formulated the first field theory in his theory of electromagnetism. Then, in the early part of the 20th century, Albert Einstein developed general relativity, a field theory of gravitation. Later, Einstein and others attempted to construct a unified field theory in which electromagnetism and gravity would emerge as different aspects of a single fundamental field. They failed, and to this day gravity remains beyond attempts at a unified field theory. In physics, the fundamental interactions (fundamental forces) are those that do not appear to be reducible to more basic ones.According to our postulationsThe point-like singularities’ spins and readiness to change their orientations, their intrinsic power to drive the strings in orbital momentum; plus the spring-like strings with their forward speed of light velocity, their left-handed and right-handed helicities and their coupling and decoupling forces provide the underlying mechanisms for the formation of different types of fields. The spacetime matrix is the platform in which the various quantum interactions take place, leading to the manifestation of the quantum fields of the subatomic particles and the different force fields.The often raised questions in this branch of physics are: How fields are formed? How do they interact? What are their types? Why are the particles seen as manifestations of their underlying quantum fields? What are force fields? How particles influence each other through fields? And so on. The answers to all these questions are found by examining below some aspects the two fundamental operators’ binary characteristics and their interactions.3) Quantum fieldsAccording to current literatureQuantum field theory (QFT) is used to construct physical models of subatomic particles. It treats particles as excited states (also called quanta) of their underlying fields, which are — in a sense — more fundamental than the basic particles. Interactions between particles are described by interaction between their corresponding fields. Each interaction can be visually represented by Feynman diagrams, which are formal computational tools, in the process of relativistic perturbation theory.Classical physics, the physics which existed before quantum mechanics, describes nature at ordinary (macroscopic) scale. Most theories in classical physics can be derived from quantum mechanics as an approximation valid at large (macroscopic) scale. Quantum mechanics differs from classical physics in that energy, momentum, angular momentum and other quantities of a bound system are reduced to discrete values (quanta). The quanta have characteristics of both particles and waves (wave-particle duality). There are limits to the precision with which quantities can be measured (uncertainty principle). Quantum field theory supports the descriptions of materials as excitations of virtual fields. This is why a lot of modern condensed matter physics and biophysics end up relying on this theory.According to our postulationsFormation of fermion particlesEvery combination of six singularities lead to the formation of generation one fermion particles as they interact with adjacent SPs and create micro disturbances in the local fabric of space. The result of these interactions, energy is passed from the SPs to form the quantum fields of the fermion particles. Therefore, different combinations of the two types of singularities are responsible for the formation of the different fermion particles. Each combination of singularities attracts strings of either left-handed or right-handed helicity depending on the net electric charge they generate. For example, six CCW spinning singularities (negative charge, -e) attract strings with left-handed helicities from the adjacent SPs forming an electron’s quantum field. On the other hand six CW spinning singularities (positive charge, +e) attract strings with right-handed helicity forming a positron. An up quark is the result of 5 CCW and 1 CW singularities giving a net charge of +⅔e attracting strings with right-handed helicity. The neutrinos with their 3 singularities of each spin direction oscillate in the level and type of strings they attract.BosonsThe bosons are formed from standard packets of coupled strings of both helicities. They have linear momentum as in the case of photons and gauge bosons such virtual photons and gravitons. Coupled strings also form gluons and W & Z gauge bosons which operate within micro distances. The composing strings of all bosons experience harmonic oscillations as they interact with adjacent singularities. If they are very close to singularities of opposite spins they decouple. The bosons are particles since they are composed of packets of strings’ momentum. They also behave as waves, since they are composed of packets of standard spring-like strings with frequencies and wavelengths as they move forward at the speed of light.4) Force FieldsAccording to current literatureThere are four fundamental interactions known to exist: the gravitational and electromagnetic interactions, which produce significant long-range forces whose effects can be seen directly in everyday life, and the strong and weak interactions, which produce forces at minuscule, subatomic distances and govern nuclear interactions. Some scientists hypothesize that a fifth force might exist, but these hypotheses remain speculative.Each of the known fundamental interactions can be described mathematically as a field. The gravitational force is attributed to the curvature of spacetime, described by Einstein’s general theory of relativity. The other three are discrete quantum fields, and their interactions are mediated by elementary particles described by the Standard Model of particle physics.According to our postulationsThe laws which govern the SPs’ quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics, as they interact with fermion particles, explain intuitively the formation of the four forces of nature, including quantum gravity.Fields which produce long range interactions between objects like gravity and electromagnetism can be explained in terms of the changes in the geometry of the SPs leading to the generation of gravitational and electromagnetic flux lines. These changes are governed by the quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics of the two fundamental operators composing the SPs.4.1- Gravitational fieldsIn the case of gravitational fields, interaction of three quarks, (u,u,d which form a proton) with the SPs leads to the creation of mass (by borrowing energy). This process involves the creation of gravitons (coupled strings) which act as the means of transferring energy from the SPs to form the quarks’ confinements.The transfer of strings from the SPs convert them into accelerating balls of energy which form the gravitational flux lines associated with the created mass. The aggregate gravitational flux lines make up the relevant gravitational field. The gravitational attraction between any two objects, at any point in the field, is determined by the acceleration level of the SPs at that point in the field. The geometry of the SPs composing the gravitational flux lines changes as they undergo radii length contractions. Their orbiting strings accelerate and get vertically orientated toward the centre of the created mass. This is why general relativity describes gravity in terms of spacetime curvature.4.2- Electromagnetic fieldsIn case of the electromagnetic force, the presence of moving charged particles lead to converting the adjacent space particles into pairs of interacting virtual electrons and positrons. These interacting pairs compose the relevant electromagnetic flux lines. The aggregate flux lines represent the electromagnetic field.The quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics of the interacting pairs of virtual electrons and positrons lead to the emissions and absorptions of virtual photons which act as the electromagnetic force carriers. Here again the SPs, which compose the electromagnetic flux lines, change their geometry as their singularities get polarized and their spins’ orientations get synchronized.4.3- The strong force fieldAccording to our postulations, the strong force works at the sub Planck level within the quarks confinements and the atoms. The direct interactions between the quantum fields of the composing fermion particles leads to the coupling and decoupling of the strings due to the characteristics of the two fundamental operators composing them. The gluons are defined as coupled strings. They act as the strong force carriers keeping the quarks within their confinements. This force is also behind the stability of the neurons when they are within the atoms’ nuclei.4.4- The electroweak forceAccording to our postulations, a neutron is composed of an electron (with a collapsed wavefunction) forced into a proton’s confinement. Once it is within its confinement it joins in the continuous flavor changes. As the electron is negatively charged and the two up quarks are positively charged, the electromagnetic force between them at such sub Planck distance leads to their interactions. They participate in flavor changes by exchanging singularities. The up quark turns into an anti-down quark and the electron turns into an anti-up quark (in line with the proposed conservation of singularities as explained in this work). An electron flavor continuously keeps appearing as part of the flavor changes within the confinements composing neutrons and antiprotons.When there is insufficient pressure to keep an electron’s flavor in a collapsed wavefunction it acquires additional mass and gets ejected. The electron and the acquired coupled strings (mass) represent the composite W- gauge boson. This process is known as the electroweak or the weak force. For this reason the W- gauge boson is negatively charged and has a relatively large mass. Current literature doesn’t recognize the weak force process in the manner described above. It tries to explain it in terms of the Higgs mechanism, where the source of the additional mass is the condensate (the Higgs field). In our analysis, the SPs represent the condensate.5) Reduction of Force with the Square DistanceAccording to current literatureIn science, an inverse-square law is any scientific law stating that a specified physical quantity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source of that physical quantity. The fundamental cause for this can be understood as geometric dilution corresponding to point-source radiation into three-dimensional space.Radar energy expands during both the signal transmission and the reflected return, so the inverse square for both paths means that the radar will receive energy according to the inverse fourth power of the range.Newton’s law of universal gravitation follows an inverse-square law, as do the effects of electric, magnetic, light, sound, and radiation phenomena.JustificationThe inverse-square law generally applies when some force, energy, or other conserved quantity is evenly radiated outward from a point source in three-dimensional space. Since the surface area of a sphere (which is 4πr² ) is proportional to the square of the radius, as the emitted radiation gets farther from the source, it is spread out over an area that is increasing in proportion to the square of the distance from the source. Hence, the intensity of radiation passing through any unit area (directly facing the point source) is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the point source. Gauss’s law is similarly applicable, and can be used with any physical quantity that acts in accordance with the inverse-square relationship.According to our postulationsIn support of the explantation given above, the strength of a force field is determined by the number of flux lines passing through a given area within the field. A flux line represents a chain of interacting surface areas of the SPs composing it.The reduction of force with the square distance is clear from our derivations of the gravitational constant relying on quantum mechanical characteristics of the SPs:G =F₀r₀²/m₀² or F₀ =Gm₀²/r₀², and from the derivation of the electric force constant relying on the quantum mechanics and quantum electromagnetic of the SPs:Ke =αF₀r₀²/e₀² or F₀ =(1/α)(Kee₀²)/r₀²).The derivation of these two important vacuum’s constants are discussed later in this work.6) Unification of the four known forces of natureFor many years an attempt has been made to unify the four forces of nature. The standard model of particle physics unifies three of the four forces, but so far no theory has successfully included quantum gravity.6.1- Force CarriersAccording to our postulations and in line with current literature the force carriers are: virtual photons, gluons and W+ bosons known as “vector gauge bosons”. The gravitons are also gauge bosons, however they don’t act as force carriers but they mediate the transfer of energy from the SPs to create the quarks’ confinements. For this reason gravity is a much weaker force than the other three forces at similar micro distances. The four gauge bosons have both momenta and directions, hence regarded as vector quantities.Using our terminology, subatomic particles which are composed of coupled strings of opposite helicities, like virtual photons, gluons and gravitons, are all bosons with spin-1. They are vector particles since they have both momentum and direction. Their emissions, absorptions and momentum are governed by the nature and characteristics of the composing two fundamental operators and by the quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics of the SPs.6.2- Roles of the space particlesThe Higgs bosons (the space particles) are regarded as scalar particles. rather than vector particles, since their uncoupled strings orbit their singularities and they have only magnitude but no direction as they are interwoven to form the spacetime matrix. For this reason they exhibit spin-0. Their geometry changes with the change of their singularities/strings ratio or with the polarization of their singularities in the presence of charged particles.The SPs are interwoven to form the three partial dimensions in addition to acting as micro clocks which make them the source of the forward arrow of time. The SPs act as the enablers for all the known quantum activities and behind the manifestation of the universe.6.3- Gluons (the strong force carriers)They are coupled strings which are emitted and absorbed due to the coupling and decoupling of the orbiting strings of two interacting fermion particles (with different helicities) within a quarks confinement. The direct coupling and decoupling of the orbiting strings of any two interacting fermion particles (with opposite charges) within a quarks’ confinement lies behind the strong force.It’s worth noting that the value of the vacuum’s fine structure constant, α, is equal to 1/137. According to our postulation, the fine structure constant represents the coefficients of the equation calculating the vacuum’s electric force (Ke =αF₀r₀²/e₀²). This means that the relative strength of the strong force is due to the direct interaction between two fermion particles within a hadron’s confinement without the need for such interaction to be mediated by the space particles, as in the case of the electric force.6.4- W+/- and Z+/- gauge bosonsAccording to our postulations, the SPs are the source of the coupled strings’ momentum which help to eject a lepton particle out of a quarks’ confinement. This combination of coupled strings and lepton particles are the force carriers termed as W and Z gauge bosons. Under the current literature, the heavy mass of these gauge bosons is obtained from the condensate in line with the Higgs mechanism. These gauge bosons have a very short life as they split back into strings (returning to the condensate, i.e. the adjacent SPs) and freed lepton particles. For example the W- gauge boson acts as the force carrier ejecting electrons out of the confinements of free neutrons and antiprotons.The presence of a moving charged lepton particle in the process of its ejection out of a quarks’ confinement has led physicists to unify this force with electromagnetism and include it under the electroweak force discipline.6.5- GravitonsThe presence of free floating singularities in the local spacetime matrix triggers a change in the geometry of the adjacent SPs. This leads to the coupling of the strings, which act as energy carriers termed as gravitons.This is why physicists associate negative energy with gravitational fields in order to comply with the law of energy conservation.Due to the transfer of energy, the vacuum SPs undergo radius length contraction in line with the centripetal force law F₀ =m₀c²/r₀. The geometrically changed vacuum SPs turn into spinning vector oriented balls of energy toward the centre of the relevant mass.The increasing levels of the centripetal acceleration (a₀ =r₀/t₀²) of the SPs as we move toward the centre of a mass determine its gravitational acceleration. The nearer we are to the centre of a mass the greater the singularities/strings ratio and therefore the greater the gravitational flux lines’ density, hence the greater the gravitational acceleration.The level of gravitational acceleration is determined by the extent of the radii length contractions of the composing SPs. This explains the distortion in the geometry of the fabric of space and the associated time dilation in line with general relativity.6.6- Virtual photonsIn the case of electromagnetism, creation of electromagnetic fields are triggered by the presence (or by the presence and movements) of elementary charged particles. The singularities of adjacent SPs to charged particles get polarized according to their CW or CCW spins’ directions. Their spin orientations also get synchronized in case of magnetic fields. The SPs turn into pairs of interacting (vector oriented) virtual electrons and positrons emitting and absorbing virtual photons along the electromagnetic flux lines.The virtual photons are composed of packets of coupled strings of opposite helicities which carry momentum from one particle to another along the electromagnetic flux lines leading to a change in their momenta. We say that the virtual photons have “mediated” the electromagnetic force between two the charged particles, or that virtual photons have been “exchanged”, and momenta have been transferred in the exchange process.6.7- Weakness of gravitational forceOut of the four fundamental physical forces in the universe, gravity is by far the weakest. It’s so weak that, for instance, a pair of tiny magnets can easily overcome the gravitational pull of the entire Earth. The reason for this is that the coupling and decoupling of the strings, which compose the gravitons, don’t act as the gravitational force carriers. The gravitons’ roles are restricted to energy transfer, which leads to the formation of mass and the associated gravitational flux lines. The differences in the mechanisms by which the gravitational and electromagnetic forces are created and work explain the weakness of gravity. The other reason for the weakness of gravity is that the gravitational flux lines are open ended while the electromagnetic flux lines are closed loops in most cases.Written byMahmoud NafousiFollow7 7 7 PhysicsGravityElectromagnetismQuantum PhysicsUniverseMore from Mahmoud NafousiFollowMore From MediumHeart2heart with pigs and baboons: What’s next?Srivaishnavi Loganathan (Sri) in SciStory 2.0Now Seriously, What’s So Tricky About Cholesterol?Dr Joel Yong, PhD in The StartupWhat Made Albert Einstein a Genius?Erik Hamre in SkillUp EdWhat’s It’s Like to Fly an 11,500-Pound Experimental Helicopter (With Zero Experience)Popular Science in Popular ScienceA Brain On A ChipGunnar De Winter in Science and PhilosophyHow Beauty and Simplicity Reveal RealityDavid AmerlandLiquid clouds or ice clouds: Geotagged bacteria genes help to decideWilliam House in The StartupAsk Ethan: Where Is The Line Between Mathematics And Physics?Ethan Siegel in Starts With A Bang!AboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Black Holes: Eyes Into Spacetime,https://medium.com/predict/black-holes-eyes-into-spacetime-eacc981a3aa1?source=tag_archive---------7-----------------------,"Space,Science,Black Holes,Astronomy,Physics","NASAGravity, one of the four fundamental physical forces that hold the universe as we know it together (along with electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force and the strong nuclear force), is something that we witness and feel the effects of everyday. At the highest level, it’s the force responsible for the visible structure of our world, the Solar System, the Milky Way galaxy and the entire cosmos as far as we can see with our telescopes.Perhaps nowhere is the full power of gravity so well represented as it is in the form of what we have come to call black holes. German physicist Karl Schwarzschild took Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity and first used it to formulate the mathematics that would come to describe black holes in 1916. It wasn’t until 1958 when American physicist David Finkelstein would give us the modern conception of a black hole as an actual “black hole” in space — a spot where gravitational pull was so great that no matter could escape from it, even particles of light.Einstein’s Field Equations (EFE) for general relativity can be shown as:Rµν − 1/ 2 Rgµν = 8πGTµνRμν is the Ricci curvature tensor, R is the scalar curvature, gμν is the metric tensor, G is Newton’s gravitational constant, and Tμν is the stress–energy tensor. The tensors describe the geometry of objects in spacetime.A black hole can be shown mathematically in the equation for the Schwarzschild radius:Rs = 2•G•M / c²Here, Rs is the Schwarzschild radius, G is the universal gravity constant, M is the mass of the star, and c is the speed of light (186,000 miles per second).The nearest black hole to us may be the A star in the binary system V616 Mon, nearly 2800 light years away from us.Our own sun (“Sol”)is not nearly massive enough to ever become a black hole. In about 5 billion years, Sol will run out of its hydrogen fuel, first slowly expanding into a cooler red giant which will envelop the 4 inner planets, before collapsing into a dim white dwarf and eventually “dissolving” into a nebula.Stars that are about 20+ times more massive than Sol have another afterlife opportunity, however: transforming into a black hole. As with the smaller stars, these giant ones also use up their hydrogen over cosmological time by fusing it into helium. When the hydrogen is gone, the stars fuse helium, and on and on, up through heavier elements like iron, until fusion no longer generates enough energy to support the star’s outer layers. Those layers collapse inward and create the massive stellar explosion known as a supernova. One star every 50 years or so goes supernova in the Milky Way galaxy. In the Orion constellation, the star known as Betelgeuse is thought to be a good candidate for going supernova. At roughly 430 light years away, it will be too far away to cause Earthly life any harm — we would need to be within about 50 light years to worry about radiation — but it will become the brightest object in our night sky aside from the Moon.After this tremendous explosion, Einstein’s equations predict that if at least 3 times the mass of our sun remain, the gravitational force will be enough for it to collapse back together and create a singularity: an infinitely tiny point in space with infinite density. This is then a black hole.Anything with mass, including light, will be pulled toward the black hole as it nears. If the mass gets close enough, it will spiral down into the black hole, eventually adding to its mass and growing it. This “point of no return” is called the event horizon.Although you wouldn’t notice anything particular as you fell into a black hole, someone watching you from a distance, would never see you cross the event horizon. Instead, you would appear to slow down, and hover just outside. You would get dimmer and dimmer, and redder and redder, until you were effectively lost from sight. As far as the outside world is concerned, you would be lost forever.-Stephen HawkingThe Chandra X-Ray Observatory space telescope, in orbit 65,000 miles above Earth since 1999, has found evidence of many black holes in the middle of our galaxy. A proliferation of black holes at our galactic center has been a theory for a long time, and it is also thought that the center of almost every spiral and elliptical galaxy contains what is known as a supermassive black hole — a singularity that could be equal to billions of solar masses. The location of this supermassive black hole corresponds to a compact source of astronomical radio waves called Sagittarius A*.NASA: Sagittarius A*supermassive black hole at center of Milky WayThough black holes appear to be empty volumes of space, they are definitely not. They represent some of the most gargantuan collections of mass in the universe, and this “absence” they create is just an illusion. Not even light can escape the event horizon due the the immense gravitational pull. However, Sir Stephen Hawking used quantum physics in the 1970s to show that black holes do not simply eat everything without consequence: they also generate what has come to be called “Hawking radiation”.Various groups of physicists in the latter quarter of the 20th century have proposed some potential ways to collect this Hawking radiation, involving reaching nearly to the event horizon with “buckets” or lowering superstrong strings into the radiation field. The limits of modern materials science renders all of these ideas purely theoretical, but with time and enough R&D we may be able to develop tools that can survive both the gravitational force of black holes and the extreme heat of Hawking radiation.One cosmic artifact that is actually generated by black hole activity is the powerful quasar. These awesome energy-generating events are created at the center of active galaxies where a supermassive black hole rapidly eats up immense quantities of matter.Aside from simply harnessing the energy of a black hole, we might also be able to create miniature black holes one day to use as a power source:…there could be much smaller mini black holes. These might have formed in the very early universe, if it had been chaotic and irregular. A black hole of the mass of a mountain, would give off x-rays and gamma rays, at a rate of about ten million Megawatts, enough to power the world’s electricity supply. It wouldn’t be easy however, to harness a mini black hole. You couldn’t keep it in a power station, because it would drop through the floor, and end up at the center of the Earth. About the only way, would be to have the black hole in orbit around the Earth.-Stephen HawkingUsing black holes as a way to travel across vast distances could be one other way we might make use of these phenomena. The idea of the Einstein-Rosen bridge, or “wormhole”, states that two points in spacetime, though they may be separated by many light years, could be connected by a structure between them. The wormhole is actually based on a solution of the Einstein Field Equations, and as such falls in line with General Relativity and is theoretically possible.While we have been able to find actual evidence of the existence of black holes, proving that wormholes exist using current technology is wholly impossible. It may be that the only way to ever prove such a potentially transcendent idea will be to attempt to traverse through one such suspected structure in a vessel designed to survive the rigors of passing into a black hole, whether that is a probe or a crewed vessel. However, even if the wormhole actually exists where we want it to, the test vessel might find itself hundreds or thousands of light years away, leaving any confirmation of the mission’s success to some hopeful scientists many generations into the future.Increasing our basic understanding of black holes, and the workings of the universe in general, is the best we can hope for our own present generations. Maybe one day we will finally discover answers to some of our greatest astronomical mysteries. Keeping the Earth, and humanity, around until then should be a priority.Thank you for reading and sharing!Predictwhere the future is writtenFollow87 Sign up for Predict NewsletterBy PredictMonthly updates on science and technology shaping our future. Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

Setting the Record Straight on How Bubbles Actually Pop,https://medium.com/discourse/setting-the-record-straight-on-how-bubbles-actually-pop-af5e67fa1642?source=tag_archive---------8-----------------------,"Science,Chemistry,Engineering,Research,Physics","If you were a child once, chances are that you’ve played with bubbles. Thanks to the fact that bubbles are both very cheap and easy to make, they have remained a universal symbol of youth for generations. Bubbles have remained an important factor in the manufacture and production of many of the materials and objects we use today, including tires, ice cream. In the production of some products like ice cream, the number of air bubbles within a fluid needs to be maximized to keep the ice cream from getting too hard. The production of other products like spray paint usually aims to minimize the number of bubbles within a fluid to keep the spray paint looking smooth and consistent. Although understanding how bubbles form and pop is a crucial part of the industrial manufacturing process of these products and many more, the rate of innovation on bubbles by itself has fallen out of popularity within the past decade. A large reason for that is because many researchers have assumed that a lot of practical research about bubbles have already been exhausted; after all, how hard can bubbles get? However, a recent discovery has the possibility to flip “fluid mechanics” on its head for years to come.This discovery started with a thought by Dr. James Bird at Boston University over a decade ago. At the time, it was a commonly accepted belief that gravity was the primary factor behind the collapse of bubbles in a fluid. However, Bird wanted to test this theory and to actually prove whether gravity was the primary factor behind bubble collapse as opposed to surface tension, a newer theory that was just emerging at the time. Bird decided that the best way to test this theory would be to pop a bubble on the underside of a fluid rather than on top and to record how the bubble collapses using a high-speed camera. If the contents of the bubble fell toward the floor when the upside-down bubble was popped, Bird could be certain that it was gravity that drove the collapse of the bubble; if the bubble collapsed the same way as it did when it was upright, they would know that it was in fact surface tension as opposed to gravity that is the primary force behind bubble collapse.Bird decided to team up with researchers from Princeton University and MIT to get to work on setting up and running the experiment. Bird and his team used a silicon oil solution to prepare these bubbles, especially since this solution was both viscous enough to be directly applied to more practical fluids while remaining extremely light, ensuring that the bubble’s weight won’t be an external factor that inhibits or changes the results of this experiment. For this experiment, Bird and his team created the set up the bubbles on top of the liquid solution at first, and then quickly flipped the solution over so that the bubbles would remain intact while the viscous nature of the oil kept the silicon solution still long enough for the researchers to record the results. However, there were still two major obstacles that prevented results early on in the experiment: the lack of a camera that could capture at both high speeds and in extremely fine detail, and an ideal lighting situation that would allow the camera to see the individual patterns on the bubble’s surface in an otherwise transparent solution. The researchers ultimately solved these two problems through brute force; they watched thousands of silicon bubbles pop in varying conditions and cameras, in the hope that at least one of these combinations would allow for the researchers to adequately visualize and measure the results. After over a decade in the works, these researchers were able to finally visualize their results this summer, with some very surprising results.A picture of the complex lighting situation needed to capture the bubbles on cameraWhen the silicon bubbles popped upside-down, the researchers realized that the contents of the bubble weren’t spilling downwards after the puncture; in fact, they collapsed back onto itself in the same manner as a regular upright bubble would, pointing to clear evidence that the collapse of a bubble in a viscous fluid was primarily driven by surface tension, not by gravity as was assumed for decades. Further evidence for this new revelation was based on the fact that these upside-down bubbles weren’t deformed and “pulled” downwards by the gravity and retained the same shape as a regular upright bubble would have taken. By using the high-speed images from the camera, researchers were also able to calculate the velocities of the collapsing bubble for bubbles of different thicknesses and diameters. Through these calculations, the researchers derived that the rate at which a bubble collapses is largely dependent on the viscosity and the capillary forces of a given fluid, while gravity actually played a negligible role.The stages of the collapse of an upside-down bubble with corresponding time framesHowever, through this extensive project, Bird and his team also discovered a surprising phenomenon that occurs on the surface of the bubble in the milliseconds before the bubble has finally collapsed. Thanks to the high-speed camera and the complex lighting settings that had been used by the team to capture the collapse of the bubble in their primary experiment, they also found out that tiny ridges were forming around the edges of the bubble creating “radial wrinkles”. Thanks to their previous discovery and calculations that pointed to surface tension being the primary factor behind bubble collapse instead of gravity, these researchers were also able to conclude that the ridges were also formed through surface tension. Usually, these kinds of wrinkles would only form on solid elastic sheets that are experiencing significant successive lateral strains and releases. Thanks to this discovery, we know that this behavior can also apply to viscous fluids as well that have a strong level of surface tension.A beautiful picture of the ridges that form as a result of surface tension as a bubble collapsesAdequately dealing with bubbles is a key part of many production and purification processes throughout the world, and knowing exactly how they react under various conditions is largely what keeps these processes from creating excess inefficiencies or just from failing altogether. Although to most people, this research around bubbles really doesn’t have much meaning or application in the real world, the truth is that bubbles are more than just a toy for children; knowing and understanding bubbles is a major reason behind the technological advancement of our society, and how materials science has remained competent enough to supplement an exponentially more industrial world. By itself, this discovery is not very exciting in the world of fluid mechanics and has a very limited scope of application. However, this groundbreaking discovery has since then opened up many more avenues of exploration in the world of fluid mechanics, avenues that are currently being taken up by researchers all over the world. Thanks to the hard work and dedication of Bird and his team, we can look forward to many more innovations and discoveries in materials science in our very near future.Dialogue & DiscourseNews and ideas worthy of discourse.Follow75 ScienceChemistryEngineeringResearchPhysics75 claps75 clapsWritten byNathan VarghFollowA lover of chemistry and the outdoors.FollowDialogue & DiscourseFollowNews and ideas worthy of discourse.

Dark Matter: The Book That Made Me Question Everything,https://medium.com/workhouse/dark-matter-the-book-that-made-me-question-everything-64d3992d8482?source=tag_archive---------9-----------------------,"Books,Physics,SciFi,Review,Dark Matter","“For anyone who has wondered what their life might look like at the end of the road not taken.”This is the first introductory sentence that Blake Crouch, the author of this mind-bending sci-fi/thriller/suspense novel, directs at the innocent reader not knowing what is about to hit them. And, boy, did I get hit… hard. Before diving into this book, I didn’t have any idea on what it was about; just that it has something to do with science and is packed with a thrilling storyline. But after turning the last page I started to question, in all seriousness, the makings of the universe and life as it is.The book follows Jason Dessen, a dad, husband, college professor and soon-to-be victim of his own self-destruction. “Are you happy with your life?” are the words that Jason will remember for the rest of his life, and that have impacted the remainder of my life as well. This almost-500 page journey explores the themes of identity, morals, the dimensions of reality, all of which have been influenced by personal decisions and cross-roads made in life. And if that isn’t enough to reel you in, it is all centered around the physics of the universe and parallel worlds that have yet to be explored. Jason’s life is probed thoroughly of the ‘what-if’s and ‘maybe’s and ‘damn, I should’ve done this or gone with that’s, steering the reader into the path that inevitably molded his life through an unnerving yet intriguing passage.While what I just wrote above sounds daunting, this book has allowed me to see through another lens on how we navigate through our existence. It made me back-track and reevaluate the major instances that have pushed me onto the route I am currently driving on. But what about the other routes I’ve never touched upon? The idea of the multiverse begins with the theories of infinite universes and alternate realities. Scientists have speculated that our universe might not be the only one out there; in fact, perhaps parallel universes exist as a consequence of spacetime continuing on forever and eventually repeating. Crouch explains the thought experiment of Schrödinger’s cat and quantum superposition in the context of being the same person across multiple pathways incredibly… that even got me, a student who didn’t really enjoy her time in first-year physics, interested in quantum states. And even if the science behind all of this doesn’t appeal to your interests, the philosophical thought of alternate dimensions containing other versions of yourself is a really fascinating idea to explore.I immediately imagined what my life would look if I had done different things in the past. Like, what if I never moved to Canada in 2017? Would I have different likes and dislikes, in let’s say, music or movies? Would I sound the same? Would I be feeling the things I am feeling right now? Would I even be writing this piece on a book that has supposedly changed my life? Or what if my family followed through with the move to Switzerland when I was in kindergarten? I often think of this scenario because of how astonishingly different I would be compared to the person I am today. And this train of thought interlinks with my new-found existential dread that I am not the only version of my that exists. What if a version of me who did move to Switzerland is out there, clueless to the possibility of other worlds around her? Is she happy with her life?As can be seen with what I’ve just written, it got easier for me to dwell on question after question about my existence and my life. But with that uncertainty arose a newfound appreciation for every decision I made in the past, whether right or wrong, that has led me to this exact moment. We often watch ourselves fly by past the years, without a second thought on what small changes we make every day that would lead to endless other possibilities. It’s really crazy if you think about it; that there are possible realms out there containing all of the outcomes to everything we have ever done. Wild.So, what’s the final verdict? Well, I would one hundred percent recommend this book to anyone out there in need of a thrilling and adventurous journey to embark on; not only the journey of reading the book but dealing with the mental aftermath that shook me (thanks to Blake Crouch!).WorkhouseOnly the coolest stuffFollow51 BooksPhysicsSciFiReviewDark Matter51 claps51 clapsWritten byNatalie SprengerFollowFollowWorkhouseFollowThe Only Publication Where We Care about Your Interests!FollowWritten byNatalie SprengerFollowWorkhouseFollowThe Only Publication Where We Care about Your Interests!More From Medium‘Normal People’ by Sally Rooney — a book reviewLeah AlyHow I Taught My Daughters to Love Books: Ages 0 to 6Guy Hasson“It Can’t Happen Here,” — Until it Does"

There are nine major categories that David Darling and Dirk Schulze-Makuch listed of how the world could end. Within each category, there’s more than one danger in it. I shall add in some more that they left out deliberately and what we humans can and should do to help preserve our civilization to the ends of the universe.The first nine I will follow the book. The solutions are mostly my own. These solutions are basically jobs. Jobs that need to be created for the safety of us all.Grey Goo. Nanotechnology gone rogue. The nanobots can eat anything and use them to construct more of them. Due to some minor errors in programming, maybe one of the nanobots gone rogue and cannot be shut down via software. The whole earth maybe eaten to become a Grey Goo. Possible prevention: acid destruction, make sure that the nanobots are within easy reach of many acids to destroy it. Build naturally biodegradable nanobots. Build nanobots predators who eat nanobots and is recognized as part of nanobots so that the nanobots do not eat this predator.When Physics goes wrong, accidental creation of mini black holes via particle accelerator, eating up the earth, strangelets, vacuum decay. The particle accelerator of the future, size of the earth or solar system or even the galaxy might have these dangers of producing black holes. I think it’s not so much of a danger as a weapon. Regardless, by that time, one should have many detectors and magnetic zones to guide the charged black hole. For the vacuum decay, that’s basically the one thing which cannot be prevented, not without mastery of the ultimate theory of everything, even then, maybe knowing the equation doesn't give us the power over nature. The only way to escape is to escape to multiverse, if theory of everything and multiverse exists.Pandemic. We had just recently seen how this played out with Covid-19 for the year 2020. And Covid is not the most fatal and infectious disease combination available. Playing plague inc, we can easily imagine a disease which can mutate to become much more fatal and infectious down the road. And these diseases are always a danger, they can spring up from time to time, so mask-wearing, online events are the new and permanent norm if we wish to reduce the dangers of pandemic wiping out the human race.AI uprising. This really requires one to be careful when building Artificial Super Intelligence. One thing we can do now is to go vegan. We don’t need meat to survive and if eating animals is the way we show power dynamics between species, the robot AI overlords may one day decide to eat humans too, learning from us.Supervolcanic eruption. We should form united one earth government, so that mass evacuation of people can be possible, invest in volcanic eruption prediction, get off the planet. Seek out planets with stable geological activities.Earth’s magnetic field changes, suns goes into Red giant. Move the earth, provide artificial magnetic shielding for the whole planet. Reengineer the planet into living inside the hollow planet, so that we can travel across the stars in spaceship hollow earth. The thickness of the ground above us helps to protect against cosmic rays, and fuels comes from sucking hydrogen out of Jupiter, the heat of the earth and gather a lot of materials from other rocky planets to form the hollow earth. This is the setting for my upcoming novel Hollow earth.Asteroid collision. Other than moving earth, use the satellites that Elon Musk wishes to send up to not only provide free internet but also to monitor the skies, as those satellites hinder the ability of ground-based telescopes to see accurately what’s out there. Make rockets that can push asteroids out of the way be able to do so when the asteroid is far away.Supernova, gamma ray burst from nearby stars. Build Hollow Earth, reinforced with many layers of lead, shielding, etc.Alien contact. Have a one united earth government, and collect all arms and military personal only for the UN, for last resort scenario in case of an alien invasion. Invest in pure science and tech research.Nuclear armageddon. Have a one united earth government, no country or nation means no war within the earth. Even after spreading out to the solar system, have a one united solar system government to prevent interplanetary war. Repeat to multiple star systems.Climate Emergency.

Humanity Obsession With Outer Space,https://medium.com/@novatransience/humanity-obsession-with-outer-space-965df4a87962?source=tag_archive---------11-----------------------,"Universe,Space,Technology,Physics","Image by WikiImages from PixabayDecades ago, when television was a novelty thing, there was a top-rated show based on the furthermore popular fictional character Superman.The opening of this program had a familiar phrase that said, “Look at the sky. It’s a bird. It’s a plane.It’s Superman!”How beloved Superman has become in our culture and the worldwide enchantment with extraterrestrials and all things cosmic emphasizes that there is a deep curiosity in all humans about nature and astronomy, even though many people didn’t know to call it stargazing.is one of the oldest sciences of all time. When archaeologists dig up ancient civilizations, even from the cavemen, they invariably find art that shows man’s unquenchable attraction with the stars.To this day, you can quickly get a lively discussion at any meeting on the topic, “Is there intelligent life on other planets?”Many have tried to explain humanity’s apparent fixation with outer space as a result of ancient consciousness or as part of humanity’s persistent nature.Whatever the cause, people of all ages and all nations share this deep engagement in knowing more about the universe in which our tiny planet is a part.It is quite strange because the actual behavior of a serious astronomy student is not a subject for great adventures. You will never see the movie “Raiders of the Lost Arc” or “Jurassic Park” made about an astronomer.The thrill for lovers of this science is to stay up all night watching the cosmos through a powerful telescope.But that fact does not seem to discourage the tens of thousands from entering astronomy each year and the considerable worldwide interest in stars, planets, and the universe.There may not be another universal human fascination that does so much to make national borders, and even international animosity seems to vanish.In addition to the Olympic movement, international cooperation to achieve meaningful advances for humanity in space seems to be progressing without interference, even when the nations that collaborate in these projects are virtually at war on the surface of the Earth.It is strange to see Russian, American, and other astronauts working together as buddies on space missions, even when their countries are busy aiming missiles at each other back at home.It almost makes you think that we should put more strength and money into the space program, not less because it seems to be a bond that heals tension, rather than creating it.Why is astronomy so exciting, even though we have no dinosaurs, creatures in motion, or any real danger to most people obsessed with development?It may be a basic curiosity that all humans have about their natural habitat and this great puzzling thing out there called space.Perhaps this goes back to the old Star Trek saying that space is “the final frontier.” But we all share this endless feeling of enthusiasm each time we pick up our telescopes and look directly at the cosmos above us.We feel that we are looking at the beginning of time.And in light of the problems with the speed of light, which means that many of the scintillating stars out there is light from those stars that started their journey for us thousands of years ago, we are looking directly into the past every time we direct our eyes to the firmament.But we need not worry about never reaching the final frontier and finding our wonder satisfied.There will always be more to learn and discover in the world of astronomy. And probably humanity’s curiosity about cosmology is also limitless.I was looking at globular clusters.Globular clusters are defined as a dense grouping of thousands to millions of stars.They are made up of young stars of millions of years to older stars of billions of years.The stars in these clusters are often closely linked to each other. They are considered objects of the deep sky.They are easily found in the night sky in the hours before midnight from April to September.They appear on your telescope as concentrated patches of gray mist.The significant part is the average distance between any of the given stars is between three quarters at one and a half light-years.The most spectacular of all is NGC 5139. You can see it with the naked eye because it is three times the diameter of the moon.There are millions of stars that occupy your display. It is truly a wonderful sight to see. If you live in North Carolina or near +36 degrees latitude, you can easily see it in the night sky.Clusters like these are prevalent.In the Milky Way, there are 150 known clusters. The Andromeda galaxy may have more than 500. Giant elliptical galaxies, such as the M87, have up to 10,000.The exciting thing is that the globular clusters contain some of the first stars that were created when time began.Its origins are still unclear. The central part of these clusters is found near the galactic nucleus.And another great majority is on the side of heaven.These collections contain a high density of older stars, but they are not great locations for planetary systems. The planets’ orbits become unstable in dense clusters.These clusters can be dated by observing the temperature at which the coldest white dwarf stars are in the group.Typical results say that some of these stars are 12.7 billion years old or more.Originally published at https://www.designyourworld.space on September 12, 2020.Written byJudy Wilkins""The joy that one finds in beauty increases because of its transience...""

Heat Crossing Through Vacuum(Quantum Way),https://medium.com/@ammar23498/heat-crossing-through-vacuum-quantum-way-77104822cf88?source=tag_archive---------12-----------------------,"Quantum Physics,Quantum Mechanics,Physics","Preface:Heat is one of the fundamental topics of Natural Sciences and Whole of Physics. But heat has different definitions according to the different versions of Physics.According to Classical Physics:Heat transfers from one place to another in the form of radiation.(Vacuum State)According to Quantum Physics:Heat can be transferred through vacuum without forming radiation.I know the physics is getting messed up. But you all have to understand that, It’s Quantum Physics! So, we gonna be talking which will and is illogical!=======================================================Now we get to our question ‘How on earth Quantum Physics does that?’ It is really a new part of Quantum Physics. Only 2 years old. The research paper was published in 2019 by Stanford University.I came across with research and I am explaining in common human language ‘How it’s done!’Main:Example:Imagine! You waked up in the morning. Today, your beautiful wife made a lovely warm black coffee for you with her lovely hands. Now you hold the mug and it is really warm. You said, Darling, Oh! I love you! Thanks for the Coffee!.Explanation:‘How did you felt the coffee as warm?’Good Question! You felt the temperature, cause the molecules in the coffee shaked and gave heat as energy to the side molecule and then the other gave the other and so forth. Then the mug got involved in this love story and they also gave each other something! Then you hand jumped in the ceremony of giving and you felt the warmness of the Coffee.(Classical Physics)===================================================Now you can see that it is one the fundamental way ‘How heat travels in classical physics.In vacuum, heat travels in the form of radiation.(Classical Physics)===========================================================================Then what does this stupid ‘Quantum Physics do?’ Good Question! It does something which makes 0 sense in human life but larger sense in Civilized Human Life.Why we need to know this question’s answer?-Cause we use rockets in missiles, ICBM and Satellites and Don’t forget Elon Musk. He also needs one!— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — -Normal Vacuum:It means the absence of particles and properties. It means ‘Nothing’. Like when you have a crush for the beautiful girl but there is 0 chance she will be your Girlfriend.Abnormal Vacuum:It still means absence of particles. It adds, it has some fleeting electromagnetic waves and particles which pop in and out into existence.Like the girl you have a crush on. There is a chance she loves your smile and she can ever love you.Single Don’t kill me. But nowadays it is the most best form of explaining something. And everyone loves beautiful girls. Unless you are part of some sort of community.— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —There should be couple of questions that I raised when I was talking about ‘Quantum Vacuum’-Quantum Vacuum Energy-Quantum Fluctuation-Zero point energyWhat is Quantum Vacuum Energy?-The vacuum energy is a special case of zero point energy that relates to the Quantum Vacuum.What is Quantum Fluctuation?-A quantum fluctuation is the appearance of energetic particle from empty space. Cause Heisenberg Principle.What is Zero-point energy?-Zerp-point is the lowest energy that a Quantum Mechanical system may have.Now when I finished talking and explaining the topics of the research paper I will end my giving a summary of the research paper.Summary:In 2019,Dec 11, Researchers at Stanford University. They invented the concept and proved the fact that heat travels differently in Quantum Vacuum.Physicists showed that little vibrations of heat can travel upto several nanometers. The experiment exploited an uncanny feature of Quantum Vacuum that it is not empty.Hao Jun Li said, They showed that two objects are able to communicate between two of them, for example hundreds of nanometers. Even though it is considered as infinitesimal for humans.In 2011 study found out that Quantum Vacuum might me able to carry heat through molecular vibrations.Applied Physics Letter, pointed out that Quantum Vacuum is understood as a place of rolling energy.Random fluctuations of matter or energy can pop up or and disappear in small scale.Generally in small scale that people can imagine.These fluctuations are chaotic and unpredictable. But they still can support as the stepping stone for carrying energy.In our case heat. In the form of Quantum excilation known as phonon(In physics, it is considered as a collective excilations in periodic, elastic arrangement of atoms or molecules in a condensed form of matter like solid and some liquids)-gap. If you are a phonon then if you wanted to jump from an inch gap. The chances are low that the right fluctuations will happen. But if we reduce it to nanometers then the chances improve and you can carry heat easily. The researchers showed the best gap would be 5 nanometers.This weird hopscotch can greatly improve the way we transfer heat across empty space. Outpacing even electromagnetic radiation. Which was previously thought as the only way to transfer heat in vacuum.That’s it!Conclusion:The researcher paper even had proofs and ‘How the experiment should be conducted for falsification test’ But it was not subject to my article. If the article seems interesting to you guys then tell me. I would consider to add an experiment version. I am writing about physics after 3 months. So, the way kinda changed of my writing. Still I added more information than ever. Cause previously I use to do fun and be sarcastic a lot. Which I know you guys loved.

Thoughts about flux,https://medium.com/@fnap/thoughts-about-flux-2505073cca6d?source=tag_archive---------13-----------------------,"Physics,Mathematics,Flux,Integral Calculus","Born with mathematicians but accepted with love by physics, the concept of flux is something that really staggered me when i was first introduced in my late calculus classes. Besides being angry about not knowing how to solve integrals and many algebraic manipulations that made me think twice if i really should be studying engineering, these classes created on me a authentic interest in the flux idea; i don’t know why, i was just fascinated by it and whenever it came up again in further exercises or topics it always made my eyes shine.Ok, but, what actually is the flux? Well, i love to start it simple so, imagine this: You are married, and everytime you and your partner have dinner, both of you discuss about who should wash the dishes. Because you are a lovely husband/wife you say: “go on honey, i can take this, i have a plan”. You get your plates, goes to the sink and opens the tap as wide as possible so the water comes fast and in a huge amount. All you have to do is put your plates in the waterpath and voilà, the dishes are clean and you barely touched any waste. The plan goes well until when the month ends and your water bill gets way more expensive than usual! Why is that? Well, because of the flux!!!The flux is the amount of *something* that goes through any surface, in this specific case, the water going through the tap hole, which is a circle, or any other format if you have a fancy tap, mines are circles. Easy right? But let me show you with a beautiful drawing:Flux of water through the tap.The first situation is a low flux situation, where you openned the tap just a little bit. The second one is a normal situation and the last one is what happens if someone has a fancy plan like yours. A lot more of water comes through that tap hole and that is why your bill is so expansiveç oh you’re so naive, aren’t you?This conclusion is trivial and sort of intuitive, right? If you put a bucket bellow it, the more water goes through the tap hole the more you will have after a certain period of time, this is determined by this relation on the left and is easy to deduce, but let’s try to think about it from another point of view. Let’s get that same circle area from the tap where the water passes through and divide it in small subsections. Now we have that hole circle area defined by lots of lots small squares. But one might say: “What about the borders? We can’t fit squares around there”, and you’re right my friend; doesn’t matter how may small little squares you have in this circle, you will never reach the entire area because in the borders you can’t have perfect squares. Unless you have infinite squares, that’s right. In mathematics this abstraction is used to calculate, amogst other things, areas in term of small pieces, like squares, this concept is called integralization!To do it, a lot of steps needs to be taken, but to make it simple, i will divide the requirements in only two:The direction of the flux relative to the surfaceIn our example, the water comes straight from the top with a 90 degree angle relative to the circle surface, so the water that comes in is exactly the water that comes out given a period of time. But, to use a mathematical rule we can’t only depend on straight sharp angles, we need to generalize it for any angle that the water(or anything else we want to measure) comes, that’s why we need a normal vector (n), which can be interpreted as a baseline from where the flux(j) can vary upon. Then we can compare how close is the flux vector relative to the normal vector, and it will aways be proportional to cosθ.Generalization of the flux in the circle.2. Sum of the flux in all infinite squaresHaving the flux vector j, we need to consider infinite vectors, one for each little square inside the circle. Each one of them represents the individual flux of the infinitesimal squares, adding them all up will give us the total flux of the circle area. That can be matematically discribed as:Sum of all flux vectors in all infinitesimal squares.ConclusionThis expression determined above can be a little strange if you missed your calculus classes (or if you are from a different field of study 😛) but it represents a lot of concepts in math and even in physics like current, eletric field, heat transfer, etc. It makes easy a lot of calculations that otherwise would be bothersome and difficult. Not only through math expressions but the flux intuitive concept is something that occurs often and visualizing it may open your mind to inner perspectives about the world around us.Written byFelipe NunesFollowPhysicsMathematicsFluxIntegral CalculusMore from Felipe NunesFollowMore From MediumValid Perfect Square: An Application of Binary Search AlgorithmMukitul Islam Ratul in The StartupTen is the Holiest NumberSteven Rosa in Cantor’s ParadiseMath behind Naive-Bayes SimplifiedArun PoochelvanIs correlation distance a metric?Alireza Modirshanechi in The StartupWhat Do You Expect the Mean to be equal to?Richard MeiHow They Estimated the Distance to The MoonWojciech Wieczorek in Cantor’s ParadiseGraphing Erdős and BaconMichael Carlisle in Cantor’s ParadiseHow to Be Happy (According to 300-Year-Old Maths)Sam Enright in The StartupAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

"<strong class=""bt"">Why do the right and left change places in the mirror, while the top with a bottom are not?</strong>",https://medium.com/@evgeny_o/why-do-the-right-and-left-change-places-in-the-mirror-while-the-top-with-a-bottom-are-not-adf088867742?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Science,Physics,Interesting,Interesting Facts,Mirror","Photo by Andre Mouton on UnsplashIf you stand in front of the mirror, you can notice one interesting phenomenon — when we wave with our right hand, then our reflection in the mirror waves with our left. That is, the left and the right changes places, while the top and bottom remain in their places. But why does this happen?How are objects reflected in mirrors?The principle of mirror operation is based on an ideal smooth surface reflecting the light rays that hit it. The motion of reflected rays along the surface of mirrors is subject to the laws of geometric optics.Why does the mirroring change sides?Let us suppose, that there is a light source, one of the rays of which enters the mirror surface. From geometry, we remember that the angle of incidence is always equal to the angle of reflection. Therefore, the reflection in the mirror will be identical and of the same size as the original.It turns out that the mirror works as if an object identical to the one reflected is located behind it at the same distance. In other words, the sides do not change places in the mirror, but change one of the coordinates along the axis located perpendicular to the mirror surface. For example, if a person stands in front of a mirror, then in reflection the back side and the front side will change, and if that person puts the mirror by himself, then the left and right sides will switch.To understand this phenomenon, it is enough to imagine a glove. The right glove turned inside out can easily be put on the left hand. So the mirror reflects objects as if it was turned inside out.And in order for a person to normally perceive his or her reflection in a mirror, he or she has to be mentally twisted around a vertical axis. And that is why in a mirror reflection, the right always changes to the left.Can you see an object in the mirror inverted from top to bottom?In mirror reflection, the horizontal axis of coordinates flipps. Depennding on the axis that is subject to change will depend on what reflection we see in the mirror.Photo by Gustavo Spindula on UnsplashTherefore, for example, when a person stands sideways to the mirror, the right-left axis is changed. And in this case, the top-bottom and the back-front remain the same in reflection, but the right and left sides change places.And if a person stands on a mirrored floor, then in the reflection of the back there will be a right in front of the front, while the right and left remain in their places. Changes will affect only the top-bottom axis, and in the mirror a person will see his or her reflection turned over the top with his feet.***Therefore, the reason for the substitution of the sides in the mirrors lies in the features of our vision and perception. And how the object is located in relation to the mirror depends on how we see it in the mirror.Written byEvgenyMedia owner in Russian.

Feel free to skipSome of them literally think velocity and speed are same, but they are different . For that we need to understand what is displacement and distance.Distance is a scalar quantity and displacement is vector quantity. Wait , don’t be serious .. i will explain in layman terms.Suppose, let me take two locations eg: hyderabad and chennai. It is approx 600 kms.Displacement is calculated with reference to position. Suppose, you are in chennai. You have urgent meeting and went to hyderabad and return to chennai next day. Here, displacement is zero, but distance is 1200 km approx..How??.. I have said displacement is calculated with ref to position. Here, position is referred to chennai . You are returned to chennai day later.. if you calculated with reference position , you are in original position only..But, Distance is calculated how much it covered. In above situation, distance is 1200 kms because you have covered that distance..Finally we are in to the topic . Speed is calculated with reference to distance over time and velocity is calculated with reference to displacement over time.Speed = Distance / Time takenVelocity = Displacement / Time takenThank you for seeing my post !!!!!!!!!!!!!Written byRajeshFollowPhysicsVelocitySpeedMore from RajeshFollowMore From MediumThe Law of Sines with ProofWojciech Wieczorek in Cantor’s ParadiseThe Ladder ProblemRhett AllainRandom Walk Introduction — Beautiful MathematicsDipro MondalSincerely, A StudentAditi in Q.E.D.The Collatz Conjecture —  Some shocking results from 180,000 iterationsSparsh Joshi in Cantor’s ParadiseToo Random, Or Not Random Enough: Student Misunderstandings About Probability In Coin FlippingMatthew OldridgeThe Doomsday ArgumentHein de Haan in Data Driven InvestorBayesian Statistics in MedicineJavier Cantero Lorenzo in Saturdays.AIAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
The universe may be a false vacuum bubble,https://medium.com/the-infinite-universe/the-universe-may-be-a-false-vacuum-bubble-961e1a177e52?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Physics,Cosmology,Vacuum,Universe,Quantum Physics","Photo by Lanju Fotografie on UnsplashThe question of how the universe came into being is one of the most difficult unanswered questions of physics (and meta-physics). Did the universe emerge from a black hole in another universe? If so, where did that universe come from? Is it turtles all the way down?Another option is that the universe is, in some sense, in a temporary state and what we think of as reality is what is called a false vacuum.A false vacuum occurs when a field has two “ground” states, one higher than the other. You can think of the false vacuum as being like a valley. On all sides of the valley are mountains and for anyone in the valley, it seems like the lowest possible place to be. Yet, unbeknownst to those in the valley, on the other side of the mountains is a sheer drop to the sea. In this case, the sea is the true vacuum, the lowest ground state of energy, and the false vacuum only gives the impression of being the lowest state because everything right around it is higher energy.In classical field theory, there is no way for something to get out of such an energy valley unless you apply some random external energy that lets things evaporate out of it, but, if your valley contains the sum total of all things that exist, then there is no way to apply external energy. Thus, everything should stay put.In quantum field theory, on the other hand, nothing is certain, and in fact a field or particle’s uncertainty as to its state will allow it to slowly leak out. You can imagine quantum mechanics adding an underground river under our valley. While things generally stay put in the valley, over time the river will carry pieces of the valley away until the valley caves in and all flushes out to sea.This is the problem of the false vacuum and it may pose an existential threat to, well, everything. If true, it could affect not just the evolution of our cosmos over time but actually pull everything down to the ground state, including all matter. Everything from quarks and electrons to protons, neutrons, atoms, and molecules would disintegrate into nothingness, as if they were never there.The word for this is that the universe is metastable. It is in a kind of resting place like the saddle on a horse, but it could easily slide off sideways and end up flat on the ground never to rise again.We know that metastable processes exist in the universe. An example is called gravothermal collapse where a star cluster of many stars buzzing like a swarm of flies collapses from a metastable state into a smaller, hotter, faster cluster with excess peripheral stars being cast out into the abyss. Happening over a stage of lightyears, such a collapse is inevitable in the complex dynamics of so many gravitating bodies and requires no quantum decay. Nevertheless, such clusters can persist for aeons without undergoing such a collapse.Physicists assure us that the order of time over which matter is likely to endure in the case of a false vacuum is probably tens of billions of trillions of years, vastly longer than the age of the universe. Then again, it is possible that it is only tens of billions of years (the universe is “only” about 13.7 Byrs old) . We just don’t know.Probability would suggest that we are likely to have evolved at a point when the universe is most favorable to life. This is a Bayesian argument (an argument about what we think is probable) so take it with a grain of salt, but if that is so then does it suggest that the universe is likely to be hostile to life in the next several billions of years? Perhaps even in the process of a complete collapse into a ground state? Such a death would annihilate not just galaxies but drag matter itself into nothingness.One is reminded of the Great Nothing in The Neverending Story, swallowing up everything into nonexistence.We also know from quantum mechanics that metastable states (false vacuums) can exist when a unified quantum field theory breaks down into several separate forces. Since we believe that there was a unified force at the time of the Big Bang, there is no guarantee that it broke down into its lowest ground states. Rather, it may have decayed into a false vacuum such that we perceive fluctuations around that false vacuum as particles. It is also possible that the universe, once in that valley, has stayed there.In the words of Michael Turner and Frank Wilczek who published a paper in a 1982 issue of Nature on this idea,[W]ithout warning a bubble of true vacuum could nucleate somewhere in the universe and move outwards at the speed of light, and before we realize what swept by us our protons would decay away.This may have already happened somewhere in the universe and is speeding towards us in an expanding bubble of nonexistence.If you’ve ever tried to boil water in a microwave, you have seen something like this happen. When the microwave boils the water, the water below the surface wants to turn into steam, but to do so it requires nucleation sites where bubbles can form. Otherwise, it becomes superheated liquid water, prevented from evaporating by the smoothness of the mug and the lack of any external vibration to shock it out of its metastable state. As soon as you place something in the water like a tea bag, the superheated water will nucleate around the bag’s irregularities and turn to steam. Those bubbles will encourage other bubbles to form causing the whole thing to froth and steam even when no additional heat is applied. (If there is enough superheated water, it could explode.)Thus, with the universe, one bubble of true vacuum would be enough to cause the universe to boil itself into nothing.Turner, Michael S., and Frank Wilczek. “Is our vacuum metastable?.” Nature 298.5875 (1982): 633–634.The Infinite UniverseScience and philosophy from a scientist’s perspective.Follow688 9 Sign up for Universes and UnicornsBy The Infinite UniverseA monthy newsletter about science and philosophy. Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

He is outlining a proof of a theory that will endure for millennia as Pythagorean theory; A² + B² = C²; the most practical piece of abstract mathematics, that the sum of the square of two sides of a rectilinear triangle will equal the square of its hypotenuse. Like many similar classes over the coming millennia, the school is bored. They’re pushing right through siesta, they had a big lunch, and the heat of the sun is making them drowsy.In the triangle is the truth. No box will ever be bisected diagonally without creating a triangle the sum of whose squared sides does not equal the square of his hypotenuse. It has been true for all time and will be true into the furthest flung future. The speed of light and sound vary based on atmosphere, the iridium-platinum alloy cylinder that defines the kilogram varies in weight annually, and gravity is only barely understood, attributed to some as yet undiscovered subatomic particle, but the triangle remains and will remain constant; as true for a triangle formed on a matchbook as it is for one imagined between far flung galaxies. Long after the heat death, after entropy has torn atom from atom and the universe is a limitless expanse of nothing, the sum of two sides of a right-angle triangle squared will still equal the square of its hypotenuse. There won’t be any triangles, of course, nor anyone to measure them, but if there were the math would be just as applicable then as it is today.Consider then pi, the number we use in sums that depend on knowing the length of a curved boundary. Pi is famously infinite, because it approaches the curve it attempts to describe with ever increasing accuracy, but can never quite get there. Pi is infinitely close and infinitely far from the truth. Consider a hexagon as an approximation of a circle — it’s close, but not quite there. An octagon is a closer, and a dodecahedron closer still, but both are still fairly far from truly circular. This is what pi is, a man-made approximation of a circle derived by measuring the sides of a many-sided figure, and this is the root of its infinite nature. Pi is as infinite as you are willing to accept inaccuracy. Pi is by definition untrue. The circle is a lie. Triangles are the truth.Ask yourself: will you be a circle or a triangle?Energy can never be destroyed, only transformed. Consider a fire. Centuries ago, the heat and light of the sun fell upon the young sapling, powering a chemical reaction that extracted carbon-dioxide from the air, separated the gas into its base components, released the oxygen, and stored the carbon; a dense battery for the energies of the sun. Today I sit before a blaze of my own making and bask in the very same heat and light of the sun that fell on that sapling when my grandfather was young. The same heat and light incinerates the humble slater bug, who dwelt within the felled log, extracting its energy for himself. His oil rich exoskeleton provides still more fuel for the blaze, expelling more of the sun’s energy out and warming the cold night.Consider the fruits that I pluck from the vine, and how they too are nourished by the heat and light of the sun. The fruits too act as batteries for the sun’s power, and my body a conduit for it. The heat and light of the sun is in my fists as I pound them against the fine, angular cheekbone of my enemy, and it is the heat of the sun that I feel in his vital fluids as they leak upon my knuckles. Consider the ocean. The heat of the sun falls upon a smallest area of its surface, and it expands. On the other side of the globe another area, deprived of the heat of the sun, contracts. A wave forms, and travels for thousands of kilometres, eventually smashing against the cliff-face, grinding it, over millennia, into sand. The sun is a gigantic, atom smashing machine, and its power is inside all things. Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed. Will you be a battery or a conduit? Will you grind the cliff or be destroyed in the immolation?Consider entropy. If energy cannot be created or destroyed, then what happens to that which we waste? Our own sun produces a billion trillion watts of heat and light, of which only the tiniest fraction falls upon verdant fields in Greece. Most of it warms the dead of space. The sun has a limited supply of fuel, and one day, it will die. Space expands. The energy spreads. At some point the butter of energy will be spread too thin. An infinite void, slightly warm. An infinite battery, low on charge.Life is nasty, brutish, and short. We only have moments. How will you use yours?Written byAlexander GroomI’m a computer programmer and start-up founder.

N/A,https://medium.com/@smshafaatmahmud/how-real-are-interstellar-travel-possibilities-54153e833b6f?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"Astronomy,Interstellar Travel,Physics,Technology,Astrophysics","How Real Are Interstellar Travel Possibilities?Let’s say in the near future the entire solar system is about to meet its doom and we humans have at best around half a century or so to flee to our new home situated at a ‘modest’ 4.2 light-years situated at the Alpha Centauri star system. But what technology do we use to get Humans there and thus continue the trait of human existence on the universe?In this article, we’ll try to attempt to answer this question by presenting 5 real interstellar possibilities that can be created with technologies available within our lifetime:1. Hydrogen Fuel Engines: Hydrogen fuels are by far the most widely used fuel in today’s rocket propulsions. The highest speed that was achieved by such an engine was around 25000mph. Yet, to get into our ‘near’ home we would require speeds of at least 10 percent the speed of light. To provide such a huge amount of thrust within such a short time is nearly impossible with such fuels. Besides the amount of mass required to provide such a thrust is unrealistic by every means. So, Hydrogen Fuel Engines? Not an option.2. Thermonuclear Thrusters: If Hydrogen fuels aren’t efficient, why not just bomb thousands of hydrogen bombs under the rockets and propel them to high speeds? Well, such a proposition was made by Freeman Dyson in the Orion Project. However, To provide a thrust we would need 300000 Hydrogen Bombs and within 1 month we will achieve speeds equivalent to 0.1c. However, the field of Thermonuclear Engines is still at its infancy and provided that we substantially improve its efficiency, Thermonuclear Thrusters may be worth a shot.3. Anti-Matter Drives: If we thermonuclear reactions are capable of producing only 1 percent of its rest mass into energy, why not build something that is an absolute 100 percent mass efficient? That’s the promise of anti-matter technologies. When a proton meets its counterpart, an anti-proton, it annihilates to form ‘pions’ (A type of Meson) which can travel at extremely close to the speed of light. If we could channel these mesons through a magnetic field it could provide thrusts at 0.5 times the speed of light with only a few kilograms of anti-matter. This would take an approximate of only 9 years to make a trip to Alpha-Cen. The catch? Antimatters are extremely hard to produce and even harder to store. Gigantic Particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider are only able to produce a handful of anti-protons. So, unlike previous techs, the Usability of antimatter doesn’t depend upon its ‘thrust-power’ but on its large scale production capability. However, Anti-Matter is likely to be the most popular fuel within the next century or so.4. Light-Sails: What if we could build a ‘sail’ that’s a kilometer wide and blast lasers underneath it that will help us literally to sail through at near light speeds? In fact, with current technologies, we can send unmanned sails coated with carbon at 0.1 percent the speed of light! However, to take humans with that sail, it will need tons of more lasers and the surface of Light-sails must be made of substances like the Sapphire. Light-Sails are a prominent future interstellar traveling technology and a better engineering capability can accelerate such sails beyond 0.1c.5. Black Hole Drive: Undoubtedly, this is the coolest option of all. Instead of dumping mass into a region of space-time, causing it to carve out a black hole, intensely powered beams of light will be in use. The hawking radiation produced by the mini black hole will then propel us to the destination. The black hole thus produced will have a mass of around 600 billion kilograms. Any smaller, the black hole will evaporate too quickly, any larger, and its Hawking Radiation would be too weak. With such a drive attached underneath the space ship, it will be possible to reach 0.1c within 20 days. However, unlike any other techs, the speed of the spaceship will keep on increasing with time which is likely to make the journey through the Blackhole drives the shortest way possible.So, upon which should we count our bets on?Provided that we prioritize the availability of current resources, Nuclear-nukes is probably the best option. To execute such a possibility, we’ll just need to increase its production factor by 200 (which we definitely shouldn’t do unless it’s about the question of human existence) and we can hope to set foot on one of the planets of Alpha centaury by the late 2100s. Antimatter technologies and Blackhole drives are tools of the very distant future that can be used to travel for intergalactic purposes. Through these technologies, we can not only travel massive distances but can reduce the time massively via relativistic effects. However, provided that we focus on innovative technologies with what we currently have, Solar sails are undoubtedly the best option. If humanity lands on another planetary system or sets on interstellar travel, there isn’t an alternative to such sails. So, yeah, based on such possibilities, we can conclude that light sails are the most probable among all of the following.Written bySayed Shafaat MahmudAn Astro enthusiast who wants to make it to the Stars!Follow1 1 1 AstronomyInterstellar TravelPhysicsTechnologyAstrophysicsMore from Sayed Shafaat MahmudFollowAn Astro enthusiast who wants to make it to the Stars!More From MediumAnother Sun and Earth?

N/A,https://medium.com/@rahul.nath.eph/the-theory-of-everything-told-through-everything-8879578e965b?source=tag_archive---------4-----------------------,"Physics,Consciousness,Philosophy,Quantum Mechanics,Creative Writing","The Theory of Everything, Told Through EverythingWhen I tell a story, there’s usually an event that seems the most logical to start with and one that is meant to end it, and that’s what defines the story. Of course, the secret in the telling is what makes it fun, but that requires stringing together selected events from my own perception and ephemeral cognition at the time to really make it a story — in particular my story.Physics can describe consciousness in a similar way. There have been theories that attempt to explain why attributable abstractions to physical objects — mass, identity, etc.— appear to have different physical manifestations in our perception but in fact represent the distributed actualization of the realized concept with which we are able to understand it. Feynman’s proposed solution to why all electrons/positrons actually belong to a singular, finitely distributed, time-agnostic entity is an abstraction that can explain a consciousness that exists in all of us, independent of time, and with properties that help us explain the similarities between us all, yet each with a unique actualization in the physical universe.So when I tell you a story from my perspective, the events that I describe non-inclusive of the beginning and end are unique events that consisted of a past moment in time that doesn’t fully describe the moment as realized by the collective universal consciousness. For this reason, everyone has their own take on “what happened”, so everyone has their own “story”, which each instance of consciousness can define, distribute, and realize based on a well-defined framework for describing an event.This theory of a completely divided consciousness follows from the no-cloning theorem, supports consequences of string theory that posits greater dimensions affecting manifest reality are “smaller” than our most fundamental abstractions of physical matter yet affect their actualization in perceivable dimensions, and has consequences that open the door to faster-than-speed-of-light travel if we play our cards right. Here’s when things are going to get really wonky.Imagine you have a mirror you’re trying to carry up an infinitely long staircase. This mirror is heavy as fuck. And like any mirror, it reflects the light that bounces up against it, and is a perfect representation of reality interpretable by any given instance of consciousness. If you break this mirror into individual atoms, it’ll still take an infinite amount of energy to take all the pieces to an arbitrary point along this infinitely long staircase. And without taking all of it, without perfect information that completely reflects the transported object as it originally existed, this broken-ass mirror is going to seem like a completely unique object and any consciousness that exists at the new point of reality-interpretation will not be able to tell that it’s pieces of the same moment.But if you break this mirror down into energy — if you can excite the electrons to harvest the photons and mass such that time itself is dissolved — then transporting this mirror to any other interpretable perspective is trivial. A quantum manifestation of this concept is entanglement, where a tensor product of quantum states is indistinguishable from one another from our perspective, yet we “know” (we don’t actually) the entities are two different things.The truth is though, while all this talk is implying that an image of our consciousness can be projected to any arbitrary point and be qualitatively and quantitatively be understood as the origin consciousness (assuming a mechanism of relatively perfect reconstruction), and also implying that this process would be reversible, the destination “shadow” consciousness is still a unique entity that must act as a “receiver”, with the explicit intention of acting as such, so that its availability as a host for the projecting consciousness is assured. What this means is, for time travel/faster-than-light travel of unique consciousnesses to be so, one must plan ahead both spatially and temporally in a coordinated manner that is beyond the scope of our understanding.Consciousness is too fluid to be matter or have mass; it is energy. It has the ability to interpret different moments in time as unique events, something that matter cannot do as mass-containing matter is not independent of time. It is not information that can be copied as energy instances are as unique as the mass it can be derived from, the mirror example isn’t a perfect abstraction for what I’m getting at. A clarification on the analogy could involve imagining the recreated mirror at the arbitrary point on the infinite staircase reflecting the moment to which it’s been transported; it doesn’t contain the information of the source, but exists in the new moment serving the same purpose, thus it doesn’t violate the no-cloning theorem.Written byRahul NathSoftware Engineer by day, amateur {economist, mathematician, writer, music producer, DJ, philosopher} all other times.FollowPhysicsConsciousnessPhilosophyQuantum MechanicsCreative WritingMore from Rahul NathFollowSoftware Engineer by day, amateur {economist, mathematician, writer, music producer, DJ, philosopher} all other times.More From MediumA Set of Philosophical and Mathematical Problems: Zeno’s ParadoxesWaldo Otis in However, MathematicsOpen Your Mind, Change Your RealityAline Müller in A Philosopher’s StoneAnarcho-Accelerationism and Its Cybernetic AntagonismsSemioflux in Lotus FruitBlinded by Darkness: The collective Denial of Evil and its Impact on Psychiatric TreatmentRev.
