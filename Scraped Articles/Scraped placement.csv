I completely agree with him. Remember, placement is not the end. It is sort of a starting point. I‚Äôve seen people who get a 6-digit salary every month and are still not happy; I‚Äôve also seen many of my seniors and friends, who didn‚Äôt get placed in so-called ‚Äútier-1 companies‚Äù, who did not get ‚Äúfat packages‚Äù but still found a better way to do great things in life.If you are feeling low or nervous, don‚Äôt hesitate to talk to your friends and seniors because they will definitely make you feel better.

Things I learned from social work placement,https://medium.com/@vannabunny1116/things-i-learned-from-social-work-placement-1132aac4c965?source=tag_archive---------2-----------------------,"Social Work,Placement,International Student","Before I share own experiences in first placement, I would like to introduce myself first.I am an international student from Chinese background. I have been living in Australia around 7 years and studying bachelor of social work degree. English as my second language or maybe third language ( I also speak Mandarin and Cantonese).Before I came to Australia, I went to the United State for one semester. That was the first time ‚Äòknowing‚Äô the concept of ‚Äòrace‚Äô. After I moved to Australia and study social work, I knowledge Australia as a multicultural country and my own position under this social structure as culturally and linguistically diverse group (CALD). The concept of CALD was pretty new to me, I never thought about the category that I have been fitted in is basically represented my identity in this social structure.Things are getting interesting after I noticed/ aware of I am from CALD group. I started try to put on the ‚ÄòCALD lens‚Äô to observe what is happening in my surrounding and reflect on my own experiences in daily life. As a CALD students, I found there are couple barriers need to overcome in placement. There are the barriers for me in placement and how I cope with them.language barrierI guess language barrier is obviously for CALD background students. Because of language barriers, sometimes I found it can be hard to understand the clients and other staffs at work. However, there is another barrier in language concerned me more, I found the most time even I know every words that other people said, but I cannot catch the meaning behind these sentences or words. There are always have hidden meaning in a conversation, and that could be hard for me to understand it and keep the conversation going. I was quite frustrated in the first few weeks in placement, then I talk this issue with my external supervisor. Through express my concern in the placement, she gave me some advises about it. Speaking is the one way to express ourself and connect with others. However, body language also can be useful in some situations. To overcome with the language barriers, I learned about active listening and being there for the clients also are important in social work practice.cultural differentMy experience of cultural differences is not only happens in placement, that is my daily experiences. However, because my role and position in placement, that is more difficult for me to cope with it. For my own understanding in cultural different, I found some concepts for me are brand new experience, but for the native people that is the common sense. These experience was very frustrating for me, I feel like I am not study hard enough or I do not really have common sense, but when I think about that in most of time I do not even know these concepts are exist. To cope with the cultural differences, I learned to be curious, just simply curious about everything that happened around me. I also learned to ask questions, the questions can be really random sometimes. But that is one of my way to learn about the cultural and knowing how other people understand the culture. I learned to ask the questions as what do you mean by that or I do not really understand that can you explain that for me ? After first placement, I found this strategy is working for me. It is not only about asking the right question in the right time, but also sending the message to the clients that I do interested in the topic that she/ he talking about, then they might willing to talk more about themselves and building rapport.For my own experience in placement, I found two main barriers for me are language barriers and cultural different. However, I also trying to find the ways to cope with it. I can be difficult in the beginning, but after the placement, I know I learned something from it and also that is part of my journey to being role as a social worker.Written byYiu VannaFollow1 1 1¬†1¬†1 Social WorkPlacementInternational StudentMore from Yiu VannaFollowMore From MediumHow Not to Annoy Your MentorMatt TannerThe Soft Underbelly of CollaborationValerie F.

Placement Story: Morgan Stanley,https://medium.com/ccmanipal/placement-story-morgan-stanley-90afef1bc6f8?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Placement,Morgan Stanley,Manipal,University,Finance","Aastha‚Äôs Placement ExperienceWe spoke to Aastha Singh, a Computer Science Engineering student from the Batch of 2019. She was the president and one of the co-founders of the ACM-W Manipal Chapter. She believes her time in Manipal shaped her as a better person for the corporate world. Aastha joined Morgan Stanley at the beginning of 2019 as an intern and by doing exemplary and consistent work has risen to the role of Technology Associate. She is currently working in the Bangalore branch of the company.Morgan Stanley is an American multinational investment bank and financial services company with its headquarters in New York City. It has offices in 42 countries spread around the world. In India, it has its offices in Mumbai and Bangalore. The company started in 1931 and has shown consistent growth, holding a good reputation in the financial world.Interviewer: Technology today plays a pivotal role in many industries. Can you tell us what role technology plays in the finance sector?Aastha: There are many components where technology plays a vital role in the finance industry. It is used in trading platforms for carrying out trade across the globe. It is used at the front desk by the Sales and Risk teams to carry out their jobs efficiently. It is used in managing portfolios of High-Net-Worth Individuals (HNI) and other organizations. Web security is another highly important part when you work at a financial institution as we deal with highly sensitive client data.Interviewer: How did you accommodate the shift from a technical background to the financial sector? Did the skills you learnt during engineering help you in your job profile?Aastha: I was offered the role of Technology Analyst at Morgan Stanley which is the starting position for all entrants. My profile required that I develop software to facilitate banking at Morgan Stanley. Therefore, I was only evaluated on my computer science skills. However, there was a two-week financial domain training given to us by the company at the start of our training program. The financial domain training covered the depth and breadth of the banking and finance sector. It helped me transition comfortably into my role.Interviewer: How helpful was your branch during placements and for your job? Can you tell us what companies value the most in one‚Äôs CV?Aastha: My branch was very helpful during placements, as studying subjects like Data Structures, Algorithms, and Java during my time in college helped me in my preparation for placements. It is extremely helpful for my job as a Java Application developer and I use Java/ OOP/ Algorithms/ DS knowledge when I code every day. An important part of software engineering is debugging which you can only do if you have a clear understanding of the core concepts. There is no one answer to what companies value the most in a CV as it varies with different companies and interviewers. For starters, your CV must have a good mix of projects, academic performance, and some kind of certification of your skill. Shine in at least one area, be it academics, projects, or being a great competitive programmer and you will have an edge over other applicants.Shine in at least one area, be it academics, projects, or being a great competitive programmer and you will have an edge over other applicants.Interviewer: How does one prepare oneself mentally for the placement process?Aastha: I would say you should go to every interview with the confidence that you will get through it. This is personally the approach I follow and a confident candidate goes a long way in the interview process. Be positive, patient, and practice well. Opportunities will always be there.Interviewer: How was the placement process for Morgan Stanley?Aastha: I applied for Morgan Stanley off-campus and was given a six-month spring internship. Based on my performance and an interview at the end, I was converted to a full-time employee. For the internship, I had three rounds with a heavy emphasis on Data Structures and Algorithms as well as Java and Object-Oriented Programming language. I would like to point out that Morgan Stanley gives a lot of importance to your knowledge of Java and OOP Concepts. They also ask questions related to Operating Systems and System Design. I would highly recommend applicants to read interview experiences available on sites like GeeksforGeeks.Interviewer: What are the roles Morgan Stanley offers and in what locations?Aastha: As far as I know, Morgan Stanley visits engineering colleges only for recruiting students for the role of Technology Analyst (equivalent to SDE in tech companies). You have the option to choose between Mumbai and Bangalore. Also, they open applications for 3rd years (summer internship) and 4th years (spring internship and full-time employee).First day at Morgan StanleyInterviewer: What made you choose Morgan Stanley and is there anything that you would have done differently?Aastha: While I was interning at the firm, I got a complete exposure to their work culture. I was able to meet the expectations of my employer‚Äôs and vice-versa. This made me choose Morgan Stanley as I was impressed with their culture of putting clients first and always doing the right thing. I would probably have brushed my development skills more during college as that is what we do every day in our jobs. This is in contrast to college projects which are relatively small and do not require much understanding of system architecture. Having said that, I was able to learn quickly during my internship and was able to complete my project.Aastha‚Äôs Morgan Stanley training batchInterviewer: The experience of being an intern and then becoming an Associate must be exhilarating. How was it for you?Aastha: During my internship, I had to complete a project that was assigned to me first and foremost. Apart from that, I also had to prepare for an exit interview towards the end which would contribute about 50% in my conversion to a full-time employee. After conversion, I joined Morgan Stanley as a Technology Analyst and went for a four-month training (called the TAP Program) in Mumbai. The program was rigorous in preparing us for our roles. It is difficult for a fresher to transition into the Morgan Stanley development environment as it is highly customized. In my training program, I was given training on a vast technology stack as well as on Morgan Stanley-related business and finance.The ACM Board in ManipalInterviewer: How do you think your board positions in Association for Computing Machinery-Women (ACM-W) helped you in nurturing your skills?Aastha: My time in ACM-W played an instrumental part in me getting an internship offer at Morgan Stanley. During the HR interview, I was asked about my role as President of ACM-W. They asked me many hypothetical questions testing my emotional intelligence and leadership skills. This is done to ensure that the candidate is a culturally fit candidate for the firm. ACM-W provided me with a platform where I could nurture those skills.Interviewer: How has your time in Manipal helped you in your current career standing?Aastha: In my opinion, the best part about my Manipal experience was the all-round development that it gave me. Not only did I polish my technical skills but also other important skills such as collaboration, leadership, and presentation.Interviewer: Are there any tips/suggestions you would like to share with our readers?Aastha: I would strongly suggest having a growth mindset.

DSA Day-15,https://medium.com/placementprep-aryagswm/dsa-day-15-8fb3d5b5a9f7?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Interview,Placement,Coding,Codingbootcamp,Programming","Hey Everyone!!! We discussed about Linked List basic problems and double linked list concept in previous story of this series.DSA Day-14Linked List Day 2medium.comMoving on towards the next step for preparing linked list, we have few basic concepts and problems.Circular Linked ListA circular linked list is a linked list where all nodes are connected to form a circle. There is no NULL at the end. A circular linked list can be a singly circular linked list or doubly circular linked list.Advantages of Circular Linked Lists:Any node can be a starting point. We can traverse the whole list by starting from any point. We just need to stop when the first visited node is visited again.Useful for implementation of a queue. Unlike this implementation, we don‚Äôt need to maintain two pointers for front and rear if we use a circular linked list. We can maintain a pointer to the last inserted node and front can always be obtained as next of last.Circular lists are useful in applications to repeatedly go around the list. For example, when multiple applications are running on a PC, it is common for the operating system to put the running applications on a list and then to cycle through them, giving each of them a slice of time to execute, and then making them wait while the CPU is given to another application. It is convenient for the operating system to use a circular list so that when it reaches the end of the list it can cycle around to the front of the list.Circular Doubly Linked Lists are used for implementation of advanced data structures like Fibonacci Heap.Since we have completed easy level problems for linked list, we‚Äôll be moving on to medium level questions:https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-list/https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list/Upcoming Posts: Off-campus Placements, DSA Day -16placement_preparationIncoming SDE Intern at Amazon || Ex-ACMS mentee at AmazonFollow2 InterviewPlacementCodingCodingbootcampProgramming2¬†claps2¬†clapsWritten byArya GoswamiFollowIncoming SDE intern at Amazon || Ex- mentee at Amazon ACMSFollowplacement_preparationFollowHelping beginners to pace up for placement preparationsFollowWritten byArya GoswamiFollowIncoming SDE intern at Amazon || Ex- mentee at Amazon ACMSplacement_preparationFollowHelping beginners to pace up for placement preparationsMore From MediumThe Flutter Guide to Firebase AnalyticsGaspard Merten in Flutter CommunityBinary search cheat sheet for coding interviews.Tuan Nhu Dinh in The StartupSay Goodbye to Pip and Virtualenvs and Say Hello to Pipenv (and Using Pipenv with Visual Studio‚Ä¶Simon ConnahNumpy uncovered: A beginner‚Äôs guideMd Khalid Siddiqui in Analytics VidhyaGenius Through The Pursuit Of Laziness‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäWhy Being Lazy Makes You A Great ProgrammerHolly BillinghurstQuerying MongoDB Like an SQL DB Using Aggregation PipelinePankaj Gupta in Better ProgrammingHAL/S, Language Used in NASA‚Äôs Space Shuttle Programs (Part 1)Afnan Mostafa in The StartupThe magic of C# closuresilias shaikh in The StartupLearn more.Medium is an open platform where 170 million readers come to find insightful and dynamic thinking."
How I Prepared for Coding Interviews in 3 Months.,https://medium.com/swlh/how-i-prepared-for-coding-interviews-in-3-months-8d54ba3bf50?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Placement,Programming,Data Structures,Algorithms,Coding Interviews","Coding Interviews require time and practice to ace. You need to be thorough with all the concepts and also be confident about the projects and internships you have mentioned on your resume. This article will give you a complete roadmap for your preparation and how I prepared for my interviews in around 3 months. This article is intended for a fresher who is about to enter the placement season and not for people having a few years of experience. I started my preparation in the month of March 2020, just after the commencement of the worldwide global pandemic.Before you go any further in the article, I would like to give a brief about my background. I am currently a final year B. Tech student from Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore with a full time SWE offer from Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale. Throughout my degree, I have worked on projects in various domains like AI, Android and Web. So, what do I mean when I say preparing for the interviews when I have had some coding experience in college? Two things basically :Undergraduates are judged only on their coding, problem solving and computer fundamentals knowledge and not on the tech stack they have worked upon. This is the reason, an AI guy might turn out to be a Full Stack Web Developer or an Android Developer may turn out to be a great Data Scientist. The technologies you work upon when you join a company may not be the technologies you work upon as a college student.The hobby projects which freshers mention in their resume rarely are up to the standards of the enterprise projects. Enterprise level software should be scalable.Data Structures and Algorithms for the base of any coding interviewNow, coming to the placement strategy, I will basically divide it into 4 parts:Choosing a language ‚Äî This is the first step for any student aiming to join a product-based company. Choose any language which you prefer and stick to it. Do not change it after a month. Go for any Object Oriented Language from Java, C++ or Python. I prepared in Java. The reason I have excluded languages like JS, C# from the list is because lot of companies do not give you the option of choosing a language other than the 3. Therefore, playing it safe, select any one of the three I have mentioned. Learn the Object Oriented Programming concepts and try to implement all of them in the language you have selected. Luckily for me, I had the Java Programming course in the sixth semester of my college, i.e, just before I started with my preparation. Thus, I could basically skip this step as I had covered these concepts pretty recently and the information was fresh in my mind.Data Structures and Algorithms ‚Äî This is the most important step of your process. DSA accounts for up to 80% of the questions you get in a coding interview. This step involves learning the basics of DSA and not competitive programming. Select any resource you are comfortable with and stick to it. You can choose either a book or a website. However, choose a single resource and stick to it. I studied from the book called Data Structures and Algorithms made easy in Java by Narsimha Karumanchi. It is one the most complete book out there and is extremely beginner friendly. The book contains multiple questions which are solved using multiple different approaches. The topics to be studied are ‚Äî Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Greedy Programming, Recursion, Backtracking, Dynamic Programming, Bit Manipulation, Binary Search and Sorting Algorithms. In the next couple of months, I will be writing separate articles on some of the important and difficult topics among them and try to give a walk through of how I studied all of them.Competitive Programming and SQL ‚Äî The third step is to get your hands dirty in the world of competitive programming. The types of questions you get in Competitive Programming(CP) are a bit different from the types of questions you get in the interviews. CP is a bit mathematical whereas interviews are a bit focused towards DSA. This is the step where you apply the concepts learnt in the previous phase and build your actual thinking ability. I highly recommend solving questions from any one of the proper competitive programming websites like Codeforces, Codechef or Hackerrank as the type of questions you get in these platforms are generally questions you have not seen before. This trains your mind in thinking about the most optimized solution on the spot and will build your thought process. Apart from this, solve questions from any one of Leetcode or Geeksforgeeks depending upon your personal preference. Apart from this, I highly recommend you to brush up your RDBMS concepts. At the same time also practice SQL questions from any website of your choice.Revision and Mock Interviews ‚Äî This is the final phase of the preparation process. Revise the concepts of Operating Systems and Computer Networks as companies tend to ask question from these topics in the online test as well as in the interviews. The final step which you need to follow and which I would say becomes the difference in you acing your first interview or not is practicing mock interviews. This step is a must as it gets you into the feel of how you need to approach the interview. This also removes the fear which you posses for the interviews making you completely comfortable with the process. During interviews, explaining your thought process to the interviewer is more important that solving the question. Thus, do at least 5‚Äì10 mock interviews before the placement season begins on Pramp. Also, go through the book called Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell a week or two before your interviews for a final revision.TIPS:Solve the questions the correct way. Always get out of your comfort zone and allow your mind to think. Otherwise, even solving a thousand questions won‚Äôt get you through.Having a breadth first knowledge of all the topics is recommended rather than having a depth first one. This will allow you to think in all possible directions for a given problem.Never ever mug up a particular approach. This will easily set you a couple of months back in your preparation. Although, it may seem as a shortcut but will definitely harm you in the long run as you are confining your mind in one direction.Whenever you learn a new algorithm, always try to implement it by yourself before looking how it is implemented in a language. This will increase your grip in the programming language of your choice.Along with programming skills and computer fundamentals, having good projects in your resume is equally important. It will allow you with some breathing space and will also give the interviewer a good impression about your problem solving skills with respect to a real time scenario.RECOMMENDED RESOURCES:Data Structures and Algorithms made Easy by Narsimha KarumanchiCracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowellLeetcode/Geeksforgeeks for DSAquestions.Codeforces/Codechef/Hackerrank for Competitive Programming.Knowledge Gate youtube channel for DBMS and OS.Hackerrank for SQL Questions.Gate Smashers for Computer Networks.This is basically the strategy which I followed during my preparation and the strategy I would recommend to any junior for their preparation. There are still lots of things which I have covered only up to a superficial level in this article which I would be covering in the future.

Placement Story: Axxela Advisory Services,https://medium.com/ccmanipal/placement-story-axxela-advisory-services-966de736aacc?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Placement,Manipal,Consulting,University,Finance","Naman‚Äôs Campus Placement Experience at ManipalWe spoke to Naman Jain, a Chemical Engineering student from the Batch of 2020. Thriving to be an all-rounder, he made the most of his college life with club activities and fests. His love for numbers ultimately led to him getting an internship in propriety trading with Axxela Advisory Services LLP.Interviewer: Where are you working right now and can you briefly describe what you are working on?Naman: I am currently a trainee analyst with Axxela Advisory Services and mainly indulge in propriety trading. During the first week of the internship, we are exposed to economics. There are about 26 interns and 125 full-time traders in the Mumbai office. Interns were divided into groups ‚Äî one group traded in the US treasuries, another in US Fed. options, another in commodities & the last group in the Australian market. There are four major asset classes, they are equity, fixed income (treasury notes & interest rate futures), forex, and commodities. Trading of all asset classes may happen on the exchange or over the counter (off the exchange). I have been trading in agricultural commodities, mainly the soybean complex. Soybean, soybean meal, soybean oil, and crush margins are the products that form the soybean complex. For example in the case of soybean, when you crush the soybean, you get soybean meal and oil. Crush margin is the price difference between the price of products(meal and oil) and the price of raw materials(soybean). All the work is done on computers, using four different screens, at a time. Throughout the whole internship, all I have done is trade. There are different types of trading ‚Äî day trading, intra-day trading and algorithm-based trading to name a few. Trading can also be classified based on the frequency, as high-frequency and low-frequency trading. High-frequency trading is generally algorithm-based and the entry and exit are quick, lasting a few minutes to hours. Low-frequency trading on the other hand is manual day trading and the gestation period can be a couple of hours to weeks.Interviewer: What does a day at work look like?Naman: A regular working day starts at 1 PM and ends at midnight. Generally, I work for 11 hours, being most active in the US timing as I was trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, an exchange in the US. Between 1 PM and 7 PM, the markets are not very active. In that time, we research international affairs and new policy decisions, as even small changes, in any part of the world can affect the markets. We also look up historical data, to understand how the product reacts in different situations, and at that time of the year. Weather is also an important factor to know about because crops depend on that. In case there is no strong agricultural news, the market looks at broad fundamentals. Also, we look at how major markets and indices are doing like NASDAQ and S&P to mention a few. The reason being that each market or industry is interrelated with every other market. For example, when S&P in the US goes up, all related markets go up, and soon it affects the entire world economy. The US Grain train (a term used for the agriculture commodity markets in the US) is said to be driven by corn. If the prices of corn go up, every other product‚Äôs price goes up, and vice versa. Hence, it is very important to be aware of every product and all happenings in the world. 7 PM is when the markets open in the US and I would be glued to my screen till about 12 AM. The office culture is the same as any other trading company. People don‚Äôt talk much, you don‚Äôt disturb others. We mostly eat at the desk. Decisions have to be taken within seconds, phones are never used during active working hours, as everyone is concentrating on the trade at all times. Punctuality is of utmost importance as, if we are late, our trading is suspended for the day. There are no paid leaves for interns, and leaves for full-time traders vary with their markets.Interviewer: Tell us about your time in Manipal? What clubs were you part of? What activities did you take part in?Naman: My time in Manipal was filled with amazing and diverse experiences. Right off the bat, I wanted to try everything and be an all-rounder. I joined the club ‚ÄòEngineers Without Borders‚Äô which is a sister organization of ‚ÄòDoctors Without Borders‚Äô, as I wanted to make an impact and give back to society. It‚Äôs an inbuilt helpful trait of mine and I worked on projects ranging from being a technical team member for Sustainable Bio-Toilets, Biogas for cooking to teaching underprivileged children. I also served on the Board as the Logistics & Sponsorship head. One of the most fulfilling projects I was part of involved us giving vocational training to around 30 illiterate people where we took computers from scrap, repaired them, and taught basic Microsoft Office for clerical level jobs. The organization also provided free of cost solar panels and did various other activities and drives. My journey with Engineers Without Borders ended with me becoming the president of the club in my third year. This pursuit of new experiences got me actively involved in Revels and TechTatva, where I volunteered in the first year and worked my way to Organizer for Sponsorship and Operations in TechTatva and Revels respectively.Naman as Category Head in Revels ‚Äò19Interviewer: Were you involved in research work or internships during your time in Manipal?Naman: During my third year of Chemical engineering, I took part in a research project under a professor but left it after two months, as I felt it was not my cup of tea. It was the same year that I got a summer internship with an MNC called SUEZ, where I worked in the sourcing team. My work mainly revolved around analyzing the spending of the company for a period of 1.5 years, which was upwards of 10 digits. My work also involved negotiation and had me negotiating worth around the middle of six figures. My overall analysis of the company finances ended with me recommending different cost-cutting methods.One of my internships after the second year involved me working for a company that worked on providing natural gas to different cities. The company was called ‚ÄòMahanagar Gas Limited‚Äô with offices in Mumbai. I worked on a project titled Virtual Pipeline Design and Network Systems. The project was divided into two parts out of which one was designing a pipeline network for the city of Chennai, which had to be spread around an area of about 350 sq. km. The design was put to use for making quotations to auction for tender. The second part of the project involved installing a gas distribution center in places where laying a cross-country pipeline was not possible.Interviewer: When did you start seriously preparing for placements? How was your experience with placements?Naman: I focused on my strengths and never had to explicitly prepare for the placements. I was not on the lookout for big-name companies but on smaller organizations where my role would have a larger impact and I could grow both personally and professionally.Interviewer: When did Axxela come on campus and what profiles did it offer? What were the locations given as options for P/I?Naman: Axxela came on campus at the beginning of the placement season and it was also the second company for which chemical engineering undergraduates were eligible. Axxela only offered a propriety trading profile and the locations available were Mumbai and Kolkata offices.Interviewer: Tell us a bit about the Axxela placement process, the rounds, and the pre-requisites. How was your experience?Naman: For Axxela or any trading company, one has to be good with numbers and fortunately, I am a math person. I couldn‚Äôt understand many of the financial terms that the company mentioned in the description during the pre-placement talk. The only terms I was familiar with were equity and forex trading and Axxela doesn‚Äôt trade on equity.The first round was a speed math test where a total of 700 students took part out of which 125 qualified. The next round (Group Discussion) was a trading game. The price of anything in the current round was a sum of all digits on the card where one number was shown at a time. The total number will of course be high at the end. The aim was simple, try and buy at less cost and sell at a high cost. After every round, you must have one lot long or short (long is when you buy first and sell later, short is vice-versa). The last was an interview round which I am quite good at. Good communication skills are a must in a personal interview. In all the rounds, they check your ability to work under pressure in a risky and panicky environment. I was asked why I wanted to change my career, from chemical to finance. I wasn‚Äôt sure what I wanted to do and I had an interest in finance, as I was good with numbers, I wanted to explore this. There is also a greater chance of better career development in finance. After the GD round, 25‚Äì27 candidates were shortlisted, and after the interview, 7 candidates were selected.Farewell for the Batch of 2020 at the MIT QuadrangleInterviewer: Any tips you would like to give to the readers?Naman: Life is long, everyone knows that, but not everyone understands that. Don‚Äôt be pressured by the conventional timeline set by people, life isn‚Äôt about that (even at 40 we‚Äôll be young as hell). It is about exploring until you find something that you can happily do for life. While doing that, it might be so that you leave numerous jobs or career paths, don‚Äôt let it hold you back. Because when you find your true passion, it‚Äôll all be worth it. Persistence always wins. Always.You can connect with Naman on LinkedIn.Interviewer & Editor: Manan Shah (Vice President, Corporate Outreach and Finance)Writers: C Mrinal Ganapathy, Pranjal Kumar, Sai Rohit (Associates)The Curious ConsultantA collection of write-ups and articles brought to you by The Consulting Club at ManipalFollow452 PlacementManipalConsultingUniversityFinance452¬†claps452¬†clapsWritten byThe Consulting Club at ManipalFollowFacilitating the transition for graduates to a future in management consulting through case-solving problems, projects, alumni talks and networking.FollowThe Curious ConsultantFollowArticles about first-hand accounts shared by Manipal alumni regarding campus placements, higher education experiences and a lot more.FollowWritten byThe Consulting Club at ManipalFollowFacilitating the transition for graduates to a future in management consulting through case-solving problems, projects, alumni talks and networking.The Curious ConsultantFollowArticles about first-hand accounts shared by Manipal alumni regarding campus placements, higher education experiences and a lot more.More From MediumHow to Spend the First 30 Days in a New RoleVictoria VitaleCreating a Workplace that Supports Female SafetyDebrah Charatan in The StartupHow To Say No Without Getting FiredKent McDonald in KBPMediaWhen‚Äôs the last time you got good feedback?Richard Kasperowski in The StartupA Blameless Culture Is More Welcoming for EveryoneAlex Steullet in KintopiaWhy Corporate Innovation is so Hardneilperkin in Building The Agile BusinessAutonomy Is Not The Antithesis Of CommunityJustus Frank in The StartupThe Rule of Three for making Better PresentationsAkshay in The StartupLearn more.Medium is an open platform where 170 million readers come to find insightful and dynamic thinking."
Placement Story: Morgan Stanley,https://medium.com/ccmanipal/placement-story-morgan-stanley-90afef1bc6f8?source=tag_archive---------2-----------------------,"Placement,Morgan Stanley,Manipal,University,Finance","Aastha‚Äôs Placement ExperienceWe spoke to Aastha Singh, a Computer Science Engineering student from the Batch of 2019. She was the president and one of the co-founders of the ACM-W Manipal Chapter. She believes her time in Manipal shaped her as a better person for the corporate world. Aastha joined Morgan Stanley at the beginning of 2019 as an intern and by doing exemplary and consistent work has risen to the role of Technology Associate. She is currently working in the Bangalore branch of the company.Morgan Stanley is an American multinational investment bank and financial services company with its headquarters in New York City. It has offices in 42 countries spread around the world. In India, it has its offices in Mumbai and Bangalore. The company started in 1931 and has shown consistent growth, holding a good reputation in the financial world.Interviewer: Technology today plays a pivotal role in many industries. Can you tell us what role technology plays in the finance sector?Aastha: There are many components where technology plays a vital role in the finance industry. It is used in trading platforms for carrying out trade across the globe. It is used at the front desk by the Sales and Risk teams to carry out their jobs efficiently. It is used in managing portfolios of High-Net-Worth Individuals (HNI) and other organizations. Web security is another highly important part when you work at a financial institution as we deal with highly sensitive client data.Interviewer: How did you accommodate the shift from a technical background to the financial sector? Did the skills you learnt during engineering help you in your job profile?Aastha: I was offered the role of Technology Analyst at Morgan Stanley which is the starting position for all entrants. My profile required that I develop software to facilitate banking at Morgan Stanley. Therefore, I was only evaluated on my computer science skills. However, there was a two-week financial domain training given to us by the company at the start of our training program. The financial domain training covered the depth and breadth of the banking and finance sector. It helped me transition comfortably into my role.Interviewer: How helpful was your branch during placements and for your job? Can you tell us what companies value the most in one‚Äôs CV?Aastha: My branch was very helpful during placements, as studying subjects like Data Structures, Algorithms, and Java during my time in college helped me in my preparation for placements. It is extremely helpful for my job as a Java Application developer and I use Java/ OOP/ Algorithms/ DS knowledge when I code every day. An important part of software engineering is debugging which you can only do if you have a clear understanding of the core concepts. There is no one answer to what companies value the most in a CV as it varies with different companies and interviewers. For starters, your CV must have a good mix of projects, academic performance, and some kind of certification of your skill. Shine in at least one area, be it academics, projects, or being a great competitive programmer and you will have an edge over other applicants.Shine in at least one area, be it academics, projects, or being a great competitive programmer and you will have an edge over other applicants.Interviewer: How does one prepare oneself mentally for the placement process?Aastha: I would say you should go to every interview with the confidence that you will get through it. This is personally the approach I follow and a confident candidate goes a long way in the interview process. Be positive, patient, and practice well. Opportunities will always be there.Interviewer: How was the placement process for Morgan Stanley?Aastha: I applied for Morgan Stanley off-campus and was given a six-month spring internship. Based on my performance and an interview at the end, I was converted to a full-time employee. For the internship, I had three rounds with a heavy emphasis on Data Structures and Algorithms as well as Java and Object-Oriented Programming language. I would like to point out that Morgan Stanley gives a lot of importance to your knowledge of Java and OOP Concepts. They also ask questions related to Operating Systems and System Design. I would highly recommend applicants to read interview experiences available on sites like GeeksforGeeks.Interviewer: What are the roles Morgan Stanley offers and in what locations?Aastha: As far as I know, Morgan Stanley visits engineering colleges only for recruiting students for the role of Technology Analyst (equivalent to SDE in tech companies). You have the option to choose between Mumbai and Bangalore. Also, they open applications for 3rd years (summer internship) and 4th years (spring internship and full-time employee).First day at Morgan StanleyInterviewer: What made you choose Morgan Stanley and is there anything that you would have done differently?Aastha: While I was interning at the firm, I got a complete exposure to their work culture. I was able to meet the expectations of my employer‚Äôs and vice-versa. This made me choose Morgan Stanley as I was impressed with their culture of putting clients first and always doing the right thing. I would probably have brushed my development skills more during college as that is what we do every day in our jobs. This is in contrast to college projects which are relatively small and do not require much understanding of system architecture. Having said that, I was able to learn quickly during my internship and was able to complete my project.Aastha‚Äôs Morgan Stanley training batchInterviewer: The experience of being an intern and then becoming an Associate must be exhilarating. How was it for you?Aastha: During my internship, I had to complete a project that was assigned to me first and foremost. Apart from that, I also had to prepare for an exit interview towards the end which would contribute about 50% in my conversion to a full-time employee. After conversion, I joined Morgan Stanley as a Technology Analyst and went for a four-month training (called the TAP Program) in Mumbai. The program was rigorous in preparing us for our roles. It is difficult for a fresher to transition into the Morgan Stanley development environment as it is highly customized. In my training program, I was given training on a vast technology stack as well as on Morgan Stanley-related business and finance.The ACM Board in ManipalInterviewer: How do you think your board positions in Association for Computing Machinery-Women (ACM-W) helped you in nurturing your skills?Aastha: My time in ACM-W played an instrumental part in me getting an internship offer at Morgan Stanley. During the HR interview, I was asked about my role as President of ACM-W. They asked me many hypothetical questions testing my emotional intelligence and leadership skills. This is done to ensure that the candidate is a culturally fit candidate for the firm. ACM-W provided me with a platform where I could nurture those skills.Interviewer: How has your time in Manipal helped you in your current career standing?Aastha: In my opinion, the best part about my Manipal experience was the all-round development that it gave me.

Placement Story: Microsoft,https://medium.com/ccmanipal/placement-story-microsoft-e27bdd2dabf3?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"Placement,Microsoft,Manipal,University,Engineering","Arvind & Priyansha‚Äôs Placement Experiences at ManipalWe spoke to not one, but two accomplished alumni ‚Äî Arvind Sasikumar & Priyansha Mishra. Arvind is a Computer & Communication Engineering graduate from the Batch of 2018. Priyansha is an Electronics & Communication Engineering graduate from the Batch of 2019. Both have varied experiences and were placed in different roles at Microsoft. Sit back and read one of our most extensive and insightful conversations.Interviewer: Microsoft Corporation is most certainly a dream company for any engineering graduate! Would you say it was the same for you?Arvind: It wouldn‚Äôt be an overstatement to say that Microsoft was ‚Äòthe‚Äô dream company for me. When I was 6 years old, my dad bought home the first computer I would ever use. It was a good old Windows 98 machine (with the floppy disks and everything!). On the very same day, he‚Äôd set up the game ‚ÄòRoller Coaster Tycoon‚Äô, a game I became instantly addicted to. Impressed by the game, I asked my dad how this was even possible; and in his answer was the first time I heard about the concept of programming to achieve anything you wished for inside of a computer. He once fleetingly remarked ‚Äòmaybe you could work for Microsoft someday‚Äô, and so, I would often think to myself, ‚ÄòI would!‚Äô. In fact, over the next couple of years when anyone would ask the little old me what I wanted to do when I grew up, and the other kids around would bring up professions along the lines of ‚Äòa doctor‚Äô, ‚Äòa scientist‚Äô, or ‚Äòan astronaut‚Äô, I‚Äôd say ‚Äòa computer engineer‚Äô. But what are the odds of that 6-year-old me actually working at Microsoft 15 years later?But what are the odds of that 6-year-old me actually working at Microsoft 15 years later?Interviewer: What is a day like in life at one of the top companies in the world?Priyansha: As a Partner Technology Strategist, a day in my life is usually spent with Microsoft Partners in deep technology conversations that can grow their business and empower customers. It involves me to be at the forefront of Microsoft‚Äôs Digital Transformation efforts for partners which makes it all the more exciting.Arvind: I work as a Software Development Engineer at Microsoft. The thing about working here is that most days are not the same. There are no fixed ‚Äòtime schedules‚Äô or ‚Äòoffice hours‚Äô, and as long as you can make yourselves available for the important meetings, you can work whenever you want. Also, you can work wherever you want for the most part, as work from home is not only available but also encouraged. It is an open workspace which facilitates collaboration, gaming zones to refresh, other campus amenities like excellent restaurants and stocked pantries and even sleeping pods! Microsoft lets you work on high impact projects that create a positive impact on the lives of so many of its users. But the best part, I feel, is the fantastic bunch of coworkers that you get to work with on daily. Everyone supports you when you need it and will try their best to help you bring your best self to work each day. Every day is a new day to learn something new.Priyansha emceeing for Revels‚Äô17 ‚Äî Haute CoutureInterviewer: How would you describe your life in Manipal both in and outside the classroom?Priyansha: Most of my life in Manipal was outside the classroom. While I did have good attendance on paper, I was not mentally present in most classes due to my lack of interest in my core subjects. Outside the classroom, I was pretty active ‚Äî experimenting with new clubs, startups and fest activities. I was running around from classes to clubs all day, leaving my room at 7 AM and only returning when I absolutely had to at 11 PM.Arvind: I don‚Äôt think I was an academically bad student. I did graduate with an 8.67 CGPA, so I guess I did alright. But I am definitely not the typical academic type; the only time I‚Äôd really sit through the course content was no earlier than a week before the exams, usually a day or two prior. Outside the classroom, I would describe myself as an extroverted-introvert. I generally kept to myself, keeping myself busy with up-skilling myself or spending some ‚Äòme time‚Äô while not ignoring the social aspects of college life (though looking back, I should have spent more time on the latter). I am a musician, so I was an active member of several bands as a guitarist in some and as a drummer in others, performing throughout the four years of college whenever we found a chance. I was also the President of the Movie Goers‚Äô Club, and we used to hold (almost) weekly screenings of movies at the auditorium! P.S. It is so weird that I haven‚Äôt been to DeeTee even once?Arvind performing as part of MAFIA ‚Äî the music and fine arts club in ManipalInterviewer: Not even once? That‚Äôs actually surprising. Well, my next question is ‚Äî how did you prepare for placements?Arvind: Personally, I didn‚Äôt really prepare for placements. My road to working at Microsoft was an internship I got during the campus placements during my 3rd year, which then got converted to a full-time offer (PPO). It was when the application for Microsoft landed in my email inbox one week before the vacations prior to my 3rd year came to an end, notifying us that the company would come to campus for internship recruitments alongside the campus hiring for the 4th years within a week of the campus reopening, that I really started to prepare for it. I am not someone who enjoys competitive coding. In fact, up until that point, I had hardly been on or solved questions on any of the coding platforms. But what I did have was solid fundamentals in programming and a large number of years doing it. So in these two weeks before the online test for Microsoft, I brushed up on my programming and software development fundamentals and solved a few competitive coding questions on some online platforms. Since I had pretty impactful internships under my belt, I prepared myself on that front. Finally, I spent some time honing my soft skills and preparing for the interview day (really important, something I have seen not most students do).Interviewer: Priyansha, this question is for you ‚Äî what were the most important things you had in mind while sitting for placements?Priyansha: From my experience during the internship placement process, I think the most important things would be to stay strong in the face of rejection, learn from your mistakes and come back stronger. I wanted to get into Goldman Sachs when the process had started at the beginning of our 3rd year. I thought Microsoft was way beyond reach. I didn‚Äôt get through Goldman Sachs‚Äô Online Test and got a call for Microsoft the very next day. I think dealing with rejection well is very important during the placement season. You need to believe that if one door closes, another will open soon enough and if you‚Äôre still grieving when it does, you‚Äôll lose that opportunity too.You need to believe that if one door closes, another will open soon enough and if you‚Äôre still grieving when it does, you‚Äôll lose that opportunity too.Interviewer: Coming to the specifics, how does Microsoft‚Äôs placement process work?Arvind: Three things you need to know about the industry are: 1. The software engineering industry grows at such an exponential rate that 2. Things that are relevant and in-demand one year may not be so in the next, which leads us to 3. The placement processes followed by most software development companies/roles undergo a change every year, and campus placement processes are often different from off-campus recruitment processes.In my case (2017), I had an online test round which consisted of two coding challenges, one easy-medium and one medium, of the types you see on LeetCode. Microsoft gave us ample time to solve the problem, a full 90 minutes. I had never seen that type of question before, but I was done before the 60-minute mark. Post that, we had a group coding round. Unlike what you‚Äôd expect from the name, the activity was one where all candidates selected from the online tests were divided into a total of four groups, and each group were given a question that they had to write down the solution to, in full code, on a piece of paper. Those selected from this round would go through another 3‚Äì4 rounds that would consist of one on one interviews with engineers and recruiters from the company. The questions would range anywhere from being asked a coding challenge and asked to solve it in front of the interviewer on the spot, to questions on programming or software engineering fundamentals to questions of a more personal nature and ones addressing your soft skills. At the end of this exercise, the selected students were shortlisted. The whole exercise would last for over twelve straight hours.Companies love nothing more than candidates who have demonstrated that they can see themselves through a complete product development lifecycle. The way I see it, there are two broad ways to succeed in software engineering interviews, and neither is better than the other. It‚Äôs amazing if you are great at both, but more often than not, you‚Äôll find that you are at least much better at one than the other. These two ways are ‚Äî software development experience and competitive coding skills.Companies love nothing more than candidates who have demonstrated that they can see themselves through a complete product development lifecycle.Priyansha: As Arvind rightly said, Microsoft‚Äôs placement process changes almost every year. There are people inside the company who work hard to make sure that it‚Äôs relevant and can attract the right talent. In the year (2018) that I got hired as an intern, we had three rounds ‚Äî Group Discussion (GD), Technical Round and HR Round.Being well-versed with EVERYTHING on your resume is literally the most important part of your preparation. Don‚Äôt put things on your resume that you‚Äôre not confident about or that you did just for the sake of doing. Nearly all of the questions in my HR and Technical Rounds were from my resume. I had removed stuff like Data Structures and Machine Learning MOOCs from my resume, even though that sounded like something Microsoft would want to see as skills. I just wasn‚Äôt confident enough in these areas to be able to tackle questions on it. You can‚Äôt bluff the interviewers into believing you know something when you don‚Äôt. So be very sure about what you put on that resume and back it up with proper justifications.Apart from the resume, I was given a couple of puzzles to solve during the Technical Round ‚Äî calculate the height of a building without any measuring equipment, sort a deck of cards in the best way possible. I had told the interviewers upfront that I was not very comfortable with Data Structures and hence they didn‚Äôt quiz me on that. From what I heard, the other candidates had a lot of questions around DSA.The HR Interview was fun. It was an easy conversation, and we primarily spoke about whether I‚Äôd want to pursue higher education, why I want to join Microsoft and what I bring to the table.For the GD, we had a discussion around Android vs iOS. I think it‚Äôs essential also to listen and not just fight for a chance to speak during the GD. When you do speak, make sure you‚Äôre able to reflect some of the other points brought out by the group. This round doesn‚Äôt just measure your speaking skills but also your listening skills.Don‚Äôt put things on your resume that you‚Äôre not confident about or that you did just for the sake of doing.Interviewer: Can you elucidate the importance of doing internships?Arvind: You don‚Äôt miraculously find the right opportunities waiting to fall into your lap; you have to take the initiative to find them instead. If there are startups near you, ask them if you can contribute. If you have someone in your network who is working on a project that seems interesting to you, ask to join in the effort. Or if you have an idea, build it from the ground up. The crux of it all is ‚Äî the initiative has to come from you. Competitive programming is the other aspect you need to be good at to succeed at getting hired. The key is to collect enough data points in such a short period that encompasses an interview to judge you solely based on that. Coding challenges can help you do this. Pick a platform, and start! Usually, if your strong point is in the work experience side, you get more leeway in the coding challenge questions. And vice versa. So pick your stronger side and hone it accordingly. Generally, the initial screening round will be an online test where you will face some coding questions, but they will usually be of no more than moderate difficulty. Do take the time to prepare for your soft skills. Good soft skills make you all the more confident and help you maintain composure. I guarantee that it is going to come in handy.You don‚Äôt miraculously find the right opportunities waiting to fall into your lap; you have to take the initiative to find them instead.Priyansha: There‚Äôs a gap between the skills you acquire through your course curriculum and the skill set required for actual jobs in the industry. How big the gap is, depends on your branch and the job you end up with. Internships help bridge that gap. During my internship at Microsoft, I learned a great deal about Conversational AI and Chatbot Development. These are industry skills that would have been useful to me even if I had not joined Microsoft. Have a target job profile and take up internships or projects that help you acquire the skills that bridge the gap.There‚Äôs a gap between the skills you acquire through your course curriculum and the skill set required for actual jobs in the industry. How big the gap is, depends on your branch and the job you end up with. Internships help bridge that gap.Arvind: When I came to Manipal, starting from the second semester, once I had comfortably settled in, I began actively searching for projects I could contribute to. I joined a computer club but soon realized it didn‚Äôt help my career. Over the next four years, I worked with two startups (another two that didn‚Äôt last very long) in Manipal, and I cannot stress the impact these have had on my career. I worked on some amazing projects with great impact, and that helped shape me into the software developer I am today. Later on, I got my internship at Microsoft, and since it got converted into a full-time offer, I already knew before my 4th year began that I had a job at my dream company. I figured this was the best time in my life to experiment, so I ended up bagging a six month internship as an IT Auditor at Deutsche Post (parent company of DHL) in Bonn, Germany. What stands out in my CV is simply my work experience. I know for a fact that the reason I was selected for the Microsoft internship was my previous experiences building impactful products. The impact isn‚Äôt defined by the quantity but rather the quality. Whenever you pick up any project, whether be it in your college life or later in your career, look for its impact. It will always serve you well to keep this in your consideration.Interviewer: When did you decide between choosing to work or going ahead with higher education? What would you say are your plans for the future?Priyansha: I always wanted to work. I knew it from the get-go. Manipal costs a bomb, and I didn‚Äôt want my parents to take the entire burden. I studied on a student loan, and until I‚Äôve paid it off, I‚Äôm not thinking of getting another costly degree.Arvind: If I were to give an honest answer to this, I‚Äôd say I haven‚Äôt. I believe I am still young to choose whichever path I want. I see pros and cons in picking either option. The two years of work experience that you will be missing out on if you go for higher studies cannot be replaced with two years of education. If your sole goal is to emigrate, there are other ways to do it; you just might have to be a little more proactive in your search. On the other hand, if you are more academically inclined, higher education might suit you better. Also, spending the two years studying gives you ample time to put your career into perspective, now that you have already got a dose of what a full-time job looks like. I‚Äôd say this is that time of your life where there are so many paths you can choose. I have some ideas on what I want to do in the near future, but I also do not want to make the wrong choices. Though time is never on your side and spending too much time, pondering comes with its consequences. I haven‚Äôt decided on something yet, but if I do, I will let you know!Priyansha at the first Board Transfer of Chords & Co, the club that she foundedInterviewer: This has been quite an interview! Wrapping up, if there was one advice you had to give to undergraduate students about college life, what would it be?Priyansha: EXPERIMENT! I cannot emphasize enough on how important it is to experiment during college. I have tried my hands at literally everything in college ‚Äî from data analytics to theatre. I have joined all sorts of clubs and even founded one. This is the time for you to try out new things and figure out what it is that you genuinely love doing. If not that, at least you‚Äôll have clarity on what you don‚Äôt like, and that‚Äôs a start.Arvind: I would suggest you note two things: first, academics are important, please do not ignore it and second, academics constitute only a small fraction of what‚Äôs important in your life and career. There is one fundamental flaw in the way academics is approached in colleges in India in general. A lot of the things you learn aren‚Äôt really useful in either your life or your career. But, almost all of these things are derived from a smaller set of fundamental understandings, which on the other hand, are important for either your life, your career, or both. So undoubtedly, your foundation has to be rock solid. As we all know, the grading system in Manipal works in a mix of relative ‚Äî absolute grading pattern. So if you take the time that you‚Äôd have otherwise spent to increase your 35 to a 43 and still end up with the same grade, and instead spend it on working projects and picking up new skills, you are gaining exponentially more in the broader perspective of things. I‚Äôll just leave you with one crucial piece of advice ‚Äî Just because you are good at something doesn‚Äôt mean that you like it or that you want to do it for the rest of your life. And this holds just as true vice-versa. Write this down. (Yes, that was a Van Wilder reference!)Arvind, during his class photoshootJust because you are good at something doesn‚Äôt mean that you like it or that you want to do it for the rest of your life.Arvind, interestingly, quit his job at Microsoft just after this interview took place. We are excited to see what lies in store for him next. You can connect with him on LinkedIn.Priyansha is currently piloting an initiative to onboard five students from Manipal and help them ramp up on industry skills while also working on a live project. This is not a Microsoft initiative, but a community one ‚Äî ideal for second and third-year students. Interested students can get in touch with her through LinkedIn.Interviewer & Editor: Yash Banka (Vice President, External Relations)Writers: Ishaan Ahluwalia, Issac B Jacob, Rupam Mondal (Associates)The Curious ConsultantA collection of write-ups and articles brought to you by The Consulting Club at ManipalFollow176 PlacementMicrosoftManipalUniversityEngineering176¬†claps176¬†clapsWritten byThe Consulting Club at ManipalFollowFacilitating the transition for graduates to a future in management consulting through case-solving problems, projects, alumni talks and networking.FollowThe Curious ConsultantFollowArticles about first-hand accounts shared by Manipal alumni regarding campus placements, higher education experiences and a lot more.FollowWritten byThe Consulting Club at ManipalFollowFacilitating the transition for graduates to a future in management consulting through case-solving problems, projects, alumni talks and networking.The Curious ConsultantFollowArticles about first-hand accounts shared by Manipal alumni regarding campus placements, higher education experiences and a lot more.More From MediumHow to Thrive as a Remote Worker Amid Coronavirus SpreadVanalli in The StartupThe Ping Pong Tables Were a LieMike Madison in The Startup10 tips to improve your Daily ScrumScott Oliver in Serious ScrumWhat I Learned About Product Management From Jazz üé∑Joe GonwaHow Close Is Too Close? ‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää On Being Friends With Your BossRefinery29 UK in Refinery29Walt Disney: How to Love What You DoZat Rana in Personal Growth6 Questions to Ask Yourself Before NetworkingChris Suzdak in Coach ChrisBuilding a Company Culture of LearningValerie Lanard in The StartupLearn more.Medium is an open platform where 170 million readers come to find insightful and dynamic thinking."
Placement Story: Amazon,https://medium.com/ccmanipal/placement-story-amazon-c6f32d3cc678?source=tag_archive---------4-----------------------,"Placement,Manipal,Amazon,India,University","Aditya & Mobashshir‚Äôs Campus Placement Experiences at ManipalWe spoke to Aditya Mohapatra and Mobashshir Javed, two Mechanical Engineering students, from the Batch of 2020. Aditya‚Äôs time at college was filled with numerous extracurricular activities along with a determined focus and plan for placements that helped him secure a role at Amazon India. Aditya‚Äôs indomitable spirit to hone his managerial skills and a keen interest in public speaking made him the General Secretary of Leaders of Tomorrow. He believes that his engagement in these various activities and events at college played a significant role in his selection process. Meanwhile, Mobashshir‚Äôs time in Manipal was nothing short of amazing and eventful. He was actively engaged in The Rotaract Club of Manipal from the first year. Being a social activist, he was an active member in organising the Kerala Relief Fund drive in Manipal and was involved in several social activities during his college life. He now works at Amazon as an Operations Manager intern. Let‚Äôs hear from Aditya and Mobashshir about their journey to one of the biggest e-commerce firms in the country.Aditya at Summit ManipalInterviewer: Hello! It‚Äôs great to be talking to the two of you today. Starting, tell us about your time in Manipal.Aditya: I‚Äôm a Mechanical Engineering student from the Batch of 2020, and before I joined college, I was both excited and a bit sceptical about Manipal as there were a lot of options going around at the time. But the four years that I spent in Manipal profoundly changed my perspective on a few elements in my life. I had this urge to be involved in various extracurricular activities. I started with becoming a part of the student clubs, Leaders of Tomorrow, and Aaina Dramatics, where I could experiment with my love for public speaking and film making. I have also actively participated in Revels and have been a part of the Anchoring team. It was a phenomenal experience of indulging in these various activities and events that taught me plenty of things at college that I simply cannot put into words. To summarise it all, I joined college with a bottle full of knowledge and came out with an ocean of it!Mobashshir at a Rotaract Club Manipal eventMobashshir: I am from the Mechanical branch as well. I was part of a few clubs, Rotaract from the beginning till my third year and ASME for a year. I also took part in the college fests, both Revels and TechTatva under the category of Vigilance at all levels of responsibilities, from volunteering to a Category head. I was also involved in social work and helping the community, like organizing the Kerala relief fund with Rotaract & Lions Club and helping with the local Manipal masjid.Interviewer: When did you start seriously preparing for placements? Tell us a bit about the placement process and what a student should keep in mind or something that we can learn from any mistakes that you might have made.Aditya: I started preparing in the summer after my sixth semester. When it comes to placements, the very first step that you should take is deciding if you want to join a core or a non-core company, it will make the process a whole lot easier. It is important to take mock tests at regular intervals and also ensure that you hone your speaking skills, learn to answer confidently, and initiate a conversation in Group Discussions and Personal Interviews as it will be a crucial factor in the selection process. YouTube is the best teacher here!Most of the companies have a basic format of selection, a written test, and an Interview that may comprise multiple rounds. There are two ways to go about placements depending on your preference of Core or Non-Core companies. For the Core companies, utilizing your summer break to revise the previous semester syllabus becomes very important as the questions will be asked from almost all the semesters. It won‚Äôt be necessary to be thorough with all topics but to be aware of the general or the most important chapters. I would suggest giving weekly mock tests of around 20‚Äì30 questions each from any website for branch wise mock tests. I found indiabix.com very useful for my preparation. For Quantitative and Verbal Reasoning, practising questions from any GRE/GMAT book will be helpful as the placement tests are relatively easier than the questions that you would be solving in these books. For the Non-Core companies, the weekly mock tests and practice from the GRE/GMAT material along with working on your soft skills will be helpful.Mobashshir: I started gearing up for placements at the beginning of my seventh semester. I began by practising the aptitude questions and learning SQL, as it is relevant to most of the companies. For the Core companies, I was revising the subject, Strength of Materials (SOM), which is considered a critical subject for Mechanical placements. The core engineering companies most often have less vacancy, and competition while the non-core jobs have better vacancies and a good package. There are very few core mechanical companies that come to our campus for placements. Further, due to my health issues in the previous year, my studies of the core Mechanical subjects had been affected, and I had less time. So, I prepared for the aptitude test. Another important thing to take care of was the CV that was sent to companies. It plays an important role during the initial selection and interview. You must be able to properly justify and account for every role that has been put on the resume. The dream companies that I selected were Maruti Suzuki, GSMO and ZS. The basic process starts with the Online Test, followed by JAM (Just a Minute) or Group Discussion, and ends with an interview. JAM is a form of extempore, wherein we are given a minute to think about specific topics and speak for 5 to 6 minutes on the topic.Interviewer: How was the Amazon placement process, and what according to you is the most challenging phase of the placement?Aditya: Amazon‚Äôs placement process consisted of three stages, an online test (OT) followed by two personal interviews. The online test had basic aptitude and verbal questions that weren‚Äôt much of a struggle, but the interviews, however, can be challenging. You have to carefully listen to what is being asked in your interviews, take a moment, and then answer. For example, I was asked that if A travelled to B in X km/hr and travelled back to A in Y km/hr, what is the average velocity of A? Be careful to not fall under the trap of calculating as the answer will be zero. They did not ask for average speed! Be very confident of your answers and talk extensively about how your co-curricular activities in college and internships have helped you develop a certain set of skills that you can implant as an Operations Manager. Almost 80% of my interview was talking about my time at Leaders of Tomorrow, and that played a major role in the selection process.Mobashshir: The entire process was quite smooth for me. I was able to clear the OT, and that boosted my confidence for the interview rounds. The good thing was that the results were to be announced once everyone was interviewed. About 60 students cleared the OT, the first round of interview was a mix of technical and HR to test your compatibility with the company and experience in the field. The second round was more tedious. As the profile was of an Operations Manager, the questions mainly focused on the experience in management roles. They dwelt deep into every experience I had and ensured that I could thoroughly justify all that I had mentioned in my resume.Interviewer: What is your current profile/job description, and how has your experience with the company been so far? Any perks of being associated with Amazon?Aditya: Currently, I am working as an Operations Management intern at one of the Fulfilment Centres (FC) of Amazon. I am in the Inbound Department, where I manage and control the incoming inventory sent by various vendors and sellers who sell via Amazon and maintain the productivity and quality metrics of the FC. Amazon is a very fast-paced organization. You get the opportunity to learn something new every day, learn to make quick decisions, and develop the ability to handle situations under pressure. You will have to put in more hours of work, but the pay would definitely be a perk!Mobashshir: I am also working as an Operations Management intern. The regular working hours are 8:30 am to 7 pm on all weekdays. My primary responsibility is to smoothen operations at the warehouse and increase the efficiency of everyday tasks. The end delivery to customers of every Amazon order is handled in the warehouse, from product packaging to setting outbound shipments.Interviewer: What is the most valuable asset on your CV according to you? What tips would you give to the readers on profile building, networking, and upskilling yourself for such managerial roles?Aditya: I would say your CV doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to be strong on both academic and extracurricular activities. Always highlight your achievements in your CV, be it club events or Internships. Keep it short and to the point. While you have the time, take up a few online courses that could be both core or non-core based. My suggestion would be to take up a course in ‚ÄòAdvanced Excel‚Äô as I feel that it will be used in 80% of jobs and would be a great addition to your CV. I would also suggest creating a strong profile on LinkedIn and start connecting with existing employees of the companies that you plan to be a part of in the future.Mobashshir: I think that the CGPA criterion is a must to get through the initial stage. Any variation in GPA through the semesters is noted, and your skillset is thoroughly questioned. A common question for every work experience and internships is about the issues that you overcame and your learning from them. If you have done an internship, you are expected to explain why you are not going to the same company. Some interviewers tend to ask in detail about any such previous companies. You have to carefully answer these questions without undermining your working capability. Everything that you mention on your CV is important and adds value to your profile. For instance, the residential address that you specify in your application has an effect as well, as the company will take your permanent residence into consideration, while deciding your salary, in terms of how far you will have to move.Interviewer: What role did your branch play during the placements process and how helpful were the technical internships/training for your growth?Aditya: My previous internships were with Tata Steel and Tata Motors, both of which helped me understand how a process is managed from start to end and the different productivity and quality metrics employed to maintain consistent flow in a manufacturing unit. Being a Mechanical engineering student, my academic syllabus didn‚Äôt help much apart from one subject, Project Management. I extensively spoke about my internships and my club activities to divert the panel‚Äôs focus from my academics, and that worked.Mobashshir: With my Mechanical branch, I had opted for Business Management as my Program Elective, the subjects through which I learned the various aspects of management. I have also done my internship at Tata Steel which helped me understand the technical aspects of manufacturing. The internship at MECON Ltd. was also an enriching experience that helped me understand the theoretical concepts taught practically.Interviewer: Any additional tips that you would like to give to the readers?Mobashshir: I can tell you what not to do. Do not panic during the exam as it can significantly affect your performance. During the GD, speaking up would seem difficult, and others might seem more confident. This could make you doubt yourself, but it‚Äôs necessary to speak what you know and portray your best. For the interview, you have to showcase that you are a value addition to the company. I would also advise you to not skip the company presentations. A few companies tend to ask from there during the interview, as you should have knowledge about the background of the company. It‚Äôs also imperative to remember that when a company rejects you, it doesn‚Äôt imply that you are not worth it. From my personal experience and also of my seniors, sometimes the company might feel that you are overqualified and you would leave soon for a better role or that the work culture doesn‚Äôt match your personality. A lot of factors can lead to rejection, so don‚Äôt lose hope because of rejections.Aditya: I would just like to add that the placement preparation has a simple process ‚Äî you set a goal, make a plan, keep practicing and time your questions. Don‚Äôt get upset if you do not perform well in the initial OTs. Your takeaway from every failed OT/Interview will benefit you in the next one. Just stay calm and take it easy. Take a deep breath before you start any OT. Imagine as if you are speaking to a new friend while you are in an interview. Present your learning from co-curricular activities and academics like a story to the interviewer. Don‚Äôt panic! Believe in yourself, you are gonna do just fine.You can connect with Aditya and Mobashshir on LinkedIn.Interviewer: Manan Shah (Vice President, Corporate Outreach and Finance) Writers: Armaan Charania, Harsh Raj, Pratyusha M (Associates)Editor: Yash Banka (Vice President, External Relations)The Curious ConsultantA collection of write-ups and articles brought to you by The Consulting Club at ManipalFollow159 PlacementManipalAmazonIndiaUniversity159¬†claps159¬†clapsWritten byThe Consulting Club at ManipalFollowFacilitating the transition for graduates to a future in management consulting through case-solving problems, projects, alumni talks and networking.FollowThe Curious ConsultantFollowArticles about first-hand accounts shared by Manipal alumni regarding campus placements, higher education experiences and a lot more.FollowWritten byThe Consulting Club at ManipalFollowFacilitating the transition for graduates to a future in management consulting through case-solving problems, projects, alumni talks and networking.The Curious ConsultantFollowArticles about first-hand accounts shared by Manipal alumni regarding campus placements, higher education experiences and a lot more.More From MediumAre Student Evaluations useful?Corey Keyser in Age of AwarenessTop Universities‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäWhat are they worth?Robert KormocziWhat makes a language teacher ‚ÄúgoodThaddeus McClearyTeaching Safely From HomeLaura Cooper in Age of AwarenessHow I‚Äôm studying JapaneseKevin Adu-SarkodieThe Story of Princeton University Science OlympiadDavid FanYou Are Not Your PurposeScarlett Cunningham PhDWhy Minecraft and Roblox Are on the Fall SyllabusBloomberg Businessweek in Bloomberg BusinessweekLearn more.Medium is an open platform where 170 million readers come to find insightful and dynamic thinking."
Off-Campus Placement Experience: ,https://medium.com/@bhcg/off-campus-placement-experience-monark-moolchandani-d592c7a8861?source=tag_archive---------5-----------------------,"Consulting,Product Management,Placement,Bits Pilani","The BITS Hyderabad Consulting Group interviewed Monark Moolchandani, a 2020 graduate of MSc. Physics + B.E Manufacturing from BITS Pilani, Hyderabad.Monark was one of the founding members of BHCG on the campus and currently works as a Product Analyst at GlowRoad.com ‚Äî a reseller network based in Bangalore.We spoke to him about his journey through college and his experience in finding an off-campus product role.Interview by: Sanket BhattQ1. When did you realize that you wanted to make a career in non-tech? Why did you choose to pick non-tech roles in particular?A. I tried to work into multiple roles before I found a perfect fit for myself. I had close to 6 internships through my college life ‚Äî spanning across fields from core manufacturing to Digital Marketing to Supply Chain Management to Business Ops to Vendor Management to Vendor Management and Strategy Consulting roles. I tried to explore every domain that a fresher could enter. While I was never a person interested in coding, I believe that some knack at knowing basic coding operations is helpful for most roles (even those in non-tech fields) that you would work in.If you get into non-tech positions and are required to work on projects, some ability to automate processes or data analysis would take you a long way. While I was in college, the trend for product roles hadn‚Äôt yet swept through the market. I realized then that I had to see what opportunities came towards me and work towards achieving those.I preferred product roles over consulting roles as I felt I was better suited towards B2C roles rather than B2B consulting roles. I also wanted to get into a field where I could see my actions directly affecting the product we put out for consumers.Q2. What would your position be as a Product Analyst? How is a Product Role different from that of a Consultant or a Business Analyst?A. The role of a consultant is usually more closely related to dealing with the upper level of management. It is related to finding the most cost-efficient method to optimize performance. Their consideration is solely increasing the client‚Äôs KPIs, the client‚Äôs performance, and the client‚Äôs value. On the other hand, a P.A. works towards creating and analyzing a product that would enhance the customer experience. Customer obsession and customer experience are paramount over any other consideration.The first question I used to ask during interviews was my team‚Äôs objective and what my role as a part of that team would entail. In consulting, you don‚Äôt know who your customers are, and you don‚Äôt know whether your solution would be ultimately considered or not. On the other hand, a P.A. role directly impacts the product, the business, and the end customer.My role at GlowRoad.com would involve checking our regular business matrices. My organization hires freshers in the standard progression of PA/APM/PM. However, we all work together on the same team. My role also involves working on new features to determine what is going on in the market and performing category analysis to figure out market sentiments about our product. It‚Äôs more of a think-and-build role wherein we analyze a lot of data and make hypotheses about the product ‚Äî similar to what‚Äôs done in case studies. In short, my role is in two phases ‚Äî building new features to generate positive customer experiences and taking in data and public opinion to solve what already exists within the platform.Q3. What other companies did you interview for in the on-campus and off-campus placement process?A. I had a Pre-Placement Offer with Tesco ‚Äî and hence, the number of on-campus roles I could sit for was reduced (due to the placement rules). I knew then that I had to crack off-campus roles if I wanted to get into product roles. I started applying for jobs in February before the COVID outbreak ‚Äî but, post-March, I put a hold on applying for jobs as I felt it was not the right time to enter the market. I started applying for companies in May again. I already had a Business Analyst role, and I wanted to focus on Product roles. I sat down and jotted down all my interests ‚Äî I saw that I preferred Retail, E-Commerce, and the FoodTech arenas (due to my positive internship experiences with Tesco and Swiggy).I applied to 6 product roles, and I managed to convert 3 of them (2 of the other processes were left incomplete) ‚Äî and I selected GlowRoad.com as being the best fit for me. I decided that I would play it a bit safe and try to be in the domain where I knew I could succeed, leaving the exploration of other fields for a stabler time.Q4. How did you find and prepare for these off-campus roles?A. My LinkedIn profile was definitely a significant driving force for the same. I have close to 6000 connections on LinkedIn ‚Äî so I was able to see a lot of places with job openings through my network. There are usually two methods to land jobs off-campus. The first is the portals like Naukri.com and IIM jobs ‚Äî however, the problem with these portals is that the number of fresher openings is severely limited. The way I used to find roles ‚Äî was to find people on LinkedIn who are in the same or similar positions. I had a vast network due to my internships ‚Äî therefore, I could get a lot of job opening notifications through my network. The problem with the first approach was that companies are unwilling to post job openings online ‚Äî as the sheer number of applicants makes it difficult for them to screen candidates.My friends in H.R. told me that the best way to get a job is to talk to or reach out to people who are directly hiring from your network or to ask them to put in a word for you when they do start hiring. I went forth with this to find people in the hiring team ‚Äî preferably a BITSian or a non-BITSian who would put in a word for me and start a casual conversation with them, leading to questions about their job and their requirements. Post that ‚Äî I would be able to understand the role, the team, and whether it was a good fit for me, and I would have developed some personal rapport as well. It was after that that I would ask for a role, mentorship, or the like. I also got a few calls from people approaching me for jobs when they found my profile on LinkedIn ‚Äî however, those roles weren‚Äôt suited to me. So, my LinkedIn was a great asset in helping me get through to these openings. In my opinion ‚Äî applying on job portals is similar to throwing your resume into an empty void.If you have good coverage on LinkedIn ‚Äî you should be able to get a fairly decent number of responses. I would recommend building up a strong network from your 2nd or 3rd year. Make it a habit to talk to a large variety of people, especially over those two years ‚Äî as these openings are just about building good strong connections. Moreover, don‚Äôt restrict yourself in niches ‚Äî talk to people who work in departments which are not always at the forefront of job openings we see like H.R. ‚Äî they would be able to give you great insights into their job and the company culture.Q5. How would you rank your CGPA, your Internships/Work Experience, your Extracurricular Activities, and your college PoRs in the order of importance to the interview process and the general job application process?A. I will just describe all of these four parameters in my experience.CGPA ‚Äî I had a CGPA of 7.85 when I graduated. A good profile with a circa 8 CGPA should get you through most roles in non-tech. For product, B.A., and Data Analyst roles ‚Äî your GPA isn‚Äôt given that hefty of a weightage. 7 is a reasonably safe zone wherein you should be able to tackle most interviews. Below 7 is where it can bet slightly trickier to defend.On the other hand, consulting roles do care about your CGPA and would often ask for a higher GPA. Most recruiters were at the top of their game academically, and hence, the higher the GPA you have ‚Äî the more of a positive impression you would generate. With a good profile and a good C.G. ‚Äî you also show that you can handle building your profile and focusing on other things while remaining committed to your day job ‚Äî your academics.Everyone in the industry knows that BITS manages to give out a slight boost vis a vis its P.S. system, and hence a 7+ is generally looked at favorably. A 9+ CGPA is seen as a major spike and will make you stand out as a candidate.Internships ‚Äî In my opinion, these are the most important characteristics of any resume or any profile. If you have good internships ‚Äî no one will care about your college PoRs. Moreover, the actual industry experience is invaluable for any interview process ‚Äî as non-tech roles are entirely about the scope of learning. I mention 3 out of my internships on my resume (at Swiggy, Tesco, and Truebill), and those were deeply impactful opportunities that I managed to receive.Extra-Curriculars ‚Äî While I worked with a few startups and a non-profit organization called COVID SOS ‚Äî they were never a part of any interview process that I underwent. So, I don‚Äôt weigh them that heavily in your job application process. However, my case study competitions were immensely beneficial in preparing for interviews and providing a talking point within the interviews.Position of Responsibilities ‚Äî I weight this the least amongst all four of these aspects. PoRs never played any role in my interviews ‚Äî they were only mentioned briefly when I had to introduce myself in the first few minutes of the interview. I did hold 3 PoRs ‚Äî all in 3-tiered impactful clubs (BHCG, BITS Embryo, TEDx BITS Hyderabad) on campus ‚Äî but those came due to a passion for the work that those clubs did, and I never considered them to be the swaying decision for my roles. In short, you will not be hampered in any interview process if you get through college without any PoRs, either. For product roles ‚Äî your mentality and problem-solving and data-crunching skills are rated higher than any PoR.To answer the question in a nutshell, I would rate Internships and Work Experience as the most important factor, followed by your academic CGPA and projects (both on-campus projects and personal pet projects), followed distantly by your Extracurricular activities and your PoRs.Q6. BITS Pilani offers a Practice School Internship system ‚Äî with PS-1 and PS-2. Could you explain your roles at the same and how they affected your profile?A. My PS-1 was at a core manufacturing company. It‚Äôs not very relevant to what I do now ‚Äî and I don‚Äôt mention it in my resume either. My PS-2, on the other hand, was very important.My first sem PS-2 was with Tesco ‚Äî the U.K. grocery conglomerate. Tesco was one of the best corporate experiences I had. It was a great company to work for, and it had a great work environment ‚Äî coupled with the fact that many BITSians were working at the company. At Tesco, I worked with the team that focused on the store insights of the offline U.K. stores. I worked with the Data Analytics part of the stores ‚Äî dealing with decisions related to discounting or implementing a new strategy or performing customer retention/reactivation analysis. My role was pretty much in line with what the team did ‚Äî in bridging the gap between the people who manage the stores and the business team. My big project at Tesco was starting up, working on and automating a process to let store managers on the ground know how their store was doing. Post that ‚Äî I also did work analyzing Tesco‚Äôs customer base and improving the performance of specific sub-sectors within this base. I was also offered a PPO in the same team post my work there.Following that, my second sem PS-2 was with Swiggy. At Swiggy, my main role was working with the strategy department on the ground concerning Swiggy‚Äôs Cloud Kitchens. I worked towards switching to and scaling up the ERP software that they used. I also developed a product for Swiggy‚Äôs Central Kitchen ‚Äî and spent about a month on this project.When I talk about the impact my PS-2 had on my resume ‚Äî it was massive. I picked up a lot of analytics skills that I have due to my work at Tesco ‚Äî especially with SQL, Tableau, and the like. It was a proper Business Analyst role, and I really enjoyed my work there. Swiggy also gave me a great experience vis a vis the insights into the day-to-day operations of the FoodTech/Start-up sector in India.Together, my PS-2 was probably the most important year of my college life, and Swiggy and Tesco were the selling point for my profile. The net P.S. experience helped me in 3 ways. Firstly, it provided me with great brand-backed internships that really pushed up my profile and gave me great experiences to talk about in my interviews. I was asked about Tesco‚Äôs business model quite a lot in my interviews ‚Äî due to its unique position of dominance in the U.K. market. Secondly, I managed to pick up a lot of soft and hard tech skills from both internships, from a B.A. role perspective and an Operations perspective. Thirdly, it exposed me to some great corporate knowledge platforms and gave me a strong work ethic culture.Q7. BITS Pilani offers students the opportunity to complete a finance minor in their time in college. Did you attempt the same? If yes, how did you feel it helped you through your non-tech job application experiences? What other courses in college did you think helped you through while attempting to bag internships or jobs?A. I did not do a finance minor. It was pretty clear to me that I wanted to finish up my courses and go for a dual sem PS-2 in my final year. To be perfectly honest, not a lot of my courses were particularly helpful in bagging non-tech roles for me. Supply Chain Management (a manufacturing course) was the only course that I felt was remotely relevant to my ambitions. But, that course isn‚Äôt taught at the level at which the industry operates. So, in a nutshell ‚Äî I did not feel that many courses helped me through my non-tech aspirations.Q8. You spoke about projects in the first few questions. Could you talk about what projects you did in college that you felt were useful?A. Projects could refer to any type of project. Projects are just basically a way for you to project your skill and open it up to the general public. These could be college projects ‚Äî or they could be apps that you‚Äôve built, websites, blogs, or any other form of expression wherein you can show your talent to the outside world. Create products and projects that the world can use and find utility in. They don‚Äôt even have to be technically intensive projects. If you are just starting up app development or web development ‚Äî you could work on ideating towards solving problems that you would typically not think of using a website or app for. If you aren‚Äôt a coder ‚Äî you can use simple no-coder platforms that would allow you to leverage technology in the same way towards solving problems. Similarly, even if you don‚Äôt want to achieve operational level growth and want something manageable and small ‚Äî as long as you can put it out and find utility in the same ‚Äî you would have been successful with your project venture.You needn‚Äôt go for college projects for the same. If you have the bandwidth towards doing a DoP, LoP, or SoP ‚Äî then you can definitely attempt the same for experience and grades ‚Äî but your projects would work fine. All projects serve to do is prove that you are a self-builder and that you are motivated to either work alone or as part of a team to get the job done.Q9. While we‚Äôre all in lockdown for the considerable future ‚Äî would you recommend any online resources or MOOCs that would serve towards improving any skills that we would need for non-tech roles?A. I am not the biggest fan of MOOCs ‚Äî I have managed to complete fairly few over my college life. If I had to suggest something ‚Äî it would be this. I would recommend people to deep-dive into their interests and figure out what aspect of engineering or non-tech they are interested in. Moreover, I would strongly recommend people to network and build connections. That takes genuine effort and is hard to do concurrently with your academics. Talk to the maximum number of people that you can on LinkedIn ‚Äî build meaningful relationships with them and maintain a master list of this information on Excel. Put feedback on a sheet so that you have contacts you can talk to after your 4/5 years of college who would serve as your referral networks, your potential mentors, and personal networks. The more people you can talk to ‚Äî the better you‚Äôll understand the market you‚Äôre entering into, and the better you‚Äôll be able to tap into the opportunities when they arise. You‚Äôll be able to leverage these contacts into finding you a better job or a different career path or the like. I cannot strongly recommend the importance of LinkedIn as a social networking platform enough.I managed to get through to the last few rounds of Flipkart APM ‚Äî but I couldn‚Äôt make it through. Even though I was rejected from the same ‚Äî the experience was significant for me. It was important from both a technical standpoint ‚Äî wherein you learn a lot through the interview process. It was also important from a psychological perspective ‚Äî because it teaches you how to deal with rejection. It‚Äôll depend on whether you use rejections to throw in the towel and decide that product roles aren‚Äôt for you or whether you pull yourself up to get the next opportunity.While I agree that brand names matter ‚Äî especially in the initial stages of one‚Äôs career, growth, learning, and exposure opportunities are equally important, the opportunities for product roles and non-tech roles are there (companies want to encourage the growth of these fields in the country), you just need to know when to tap into them. For that, you need to build connections. Be ambitious with LinkedIn ‚Äî exploit it and use it to your benefit.So, I would suggest that better than MOOCs ‚Äî talk to people who are working in the fields you are interested in. Create a list of the skills that your top companies require from you ‚Äî both soft and hard skills. Subsequently ‚Äî work on mastering those skills and working towards using them from a practical standpoint. Beyond that, you can start buffing up your profile with case studies, projects, and internship opportunities.Q10. How did you go about preparing for your internships with particular reference to the case study competitions?A. During my prep for the Flipkart APM process ‚Äî I used to do Mock Case Studies with an APM from IIT Madras. I am not really a book person. I preferred doing mock case studies with people from campus and people from other campuses and preferred working with them. You need people to teach you new approaches ‚Äî the approaches that are looked favorably in the market right now. All the IIT‚Äôs have a fairly strong case study preparation culture as they start their placement cycle earlier than us. You need to keep doing mocks to point out the flaws that you are making. I would also recommend talking to people from other campuses ‚Äî as they would have a different approach than you.Moreover, you need to find people who would be brutally honest about your performance as case studies are fairly subjective and conversation-based. I would not recommend book level preparation as it can get quite monotonous, and the content in those books is old and would rarely reflect the current market approaches. I felt that it was super important to be consistent with your preparation. Case studies have a great learning curve ‚Äî if you can do 10 mocks, it will be your 11th mock case study that will teach you a new approach that you can use.Lastly, I would recommend being varied in your preparation ‚Äî as interview case studies are never of one type. I would recommend doing different case studies in your preparation ‚Äî It may be a P/L case study one day with an Ops case study the next with a Guesstimate on the next day. Just remember that Case Studies are more like a conversation between you and the interviewer wherein the interviewer just wants to see how you think and approach a strategic business problem. Hence, variety and dynamism are key.Q11. Do you have any plans to give CAT or go for an MBA at any time in the near future?A. My focus is to go on an MBA abroad after 3‚Äì4 years of work experience. I am a people person ‚Äî I enjoy meeting new people, and hence my idea for an MBA would be centered around networking and building connections with different people. CAT is a bit of a problematic situation for me ‚Äî it gets tougher every year ‚Äî especially for Engineering background General Male Candidates, and I would not prefer to set myself up for failure for the same. Even if I get a 99.5 %ile, there is no guarantee of me getting a call-up from IIM A, B, C.My current plan would be to give GMAT a few years later ‚Äî with an option to give CAT too as 3+ years of work experience would be looked favorably upon. But, I believe I can survive easily in the industry for another few years without an MBA before I have to worry about that aspect.Q12. Starting from 2‚Äì1, could you give us a detailed description of how you went about building your profile?A. I started with a CGPA of 6.1 ‚Äî so, my first priority was moving that upwards so that I don‚Äôt get rejected just because of my CGPA. Post that ‚Äî I started focusing on acquiring Internships and Work Experience ‚Äî as I felt that would be an essential part of driving my profile. My PoRs came out of passion ‚Äî I was really attached to the clubs that I worked for, and I wanted to grow and expand them to the extent that we could actually showcase the work we were doing on a bigger scale. I started BHCG because I wanted to build a consulting culture on campus ‚Äî I felt that neither did companies know that there was a consulting culture on campus and nor did the students know that an opportunity called consulting exists.My Extracurricular activities also started naturally ‚Äî I just wanted to go in with the mindset of exploring as many fields as possible so that I could find an appropriate fit for me. Until you find the proper fit for yourself, you won‚Äôt enjoy the job or the company‚Äôs culture. I feel the worst part of on-campus recruiting is that you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre signing up for as most people are just lured by the CTC and headliner figures. Do a lot of research to determine if you would be a good fit for the role you‚Äôre applying for.It is not compulsory that if you have a finance minor that you have to go to a bank-related P.S. station and do some form of reporting work. That is a common mistake people make ‚Äî especially when they are armed with a finance minor. You can always do an MBA if you choose to enter into an I.B. or Corporate Finance ‚Äî but, if you think a reporting or analysis job is not for you ‚Äî then you are better off staying out of it. While a brand matters greatly on your resume, having a productive, positive, and educational work experience is even more important. Everyone knows that BITSians get a PS-2 internship based on their CGPA ‚Äî so maintaining a level of understanding over your job and your fit is essential. If you are interested in product roles or non-tech roles and can‚Äôt find anything on campus, you should try for off-campus roles because you would have a clear understanding of what you need to do and what the J.D. would ask from you.Q13. If you had to give some advice to your juniors, what would it be?A. If you can code or if there‚Äôs even a small chance that you can enter into I.T. ‚Äî give it a decent shot. Give 6 months of focused and dedicated work towards fields like Competitive Coding. Even if you choose not to enter into I.T. later, it will definitely help you throughout your career. CC improves the way you think about problems from more than a C.S. standpoint, and the pay-off is immense. Irrespective of whether it‚Äôs App Development, Web Development, Competitive Coding, or Data Analytics ‚Äî if you have a shot, try to code.It makes you more tech-savvy, adds a point of conversation to your networking, and equips you with some necessary tech skills that are almost becoming a ubiquitous requirement in any industry these days. Lastly, and again, exploit LinkedIn to whatever extent you can ‚Äî even if it‚Äôs within your campus, and capitalize on it towards gaining information about yourself, the market requirements and the market‚Äôs job descriptions. Code committedly and network extensively ‚Äî those would be my two suggestions.Written byBITS Hyderabad Consulting GroupBHCG brings together the Consulting enthusiasts from BITS Pilani Hyderabad.Follow88 88¬†88¬†ConsultingProduct ManagementPlacementBits PilaniMore from BITS Hyderabad Consulting GroupFollowBHCG brings together the Consulting enthusiasts from BITS Pilani Hyderabad.More From MediumDaily Meetings VS Daily ReportsTiago FurlanettoThe One-Minute TestJared M.

How to Ace Placement Interviews,https://medium.com/@rishavghosh605/how-to-do-placement-interviews-28200856e72c?source=tag_archive---------7-----------------------,"Placement,Coding,Interview Questions,Interview,College","Photo from careerealiasm.comA Little About MeI am Rishav Ghosh, a final year student pursuing B.Tech. in Information Technology from VIT Vellore. I have been programming since I was 14. I have always been more into development then competitive programming. Thus I have been a victim of rumors like you need to become a 6 star coder on Codechef to get a good job. Development comes later, start CP just as you get into college. Notwithstanding these rumors I mostly continued learning new tech and languages till the end of my second year. After which I began my preparation for getting a job. Not much later in about three months I finally got an internship at Microsoft and finally in about 6 months my dream came true and I got my PPO from Microsoft. I guess in retrospect if I had started earlier my three months of preparation would have been less grueling. Thus I can confidently say its more about the quality of time you use then the quantity. Some of my friends who had started late in their 3rd year of college got placed in good companies in their final year.Why have I written this article?There is an ongoing myth that for coding interviews one should just jump into coding platforms like Hackerrank ,CodeNation or grind on Leetcode and do CP from the moment they get into college. I plan on making this article to bust the above myth and show that with a write plan you can achieve 2 years work in 3 months. In this article I express my views on the subject.From my several interview experiences I have found that two things are very important when it comes to acing the coding interviews there are two things one needs to have :A GOOD PLANPlenty of Resources to help them understand a problem(from its brute force to optimal algorithm).A few miscellaneous things like- core concepts(DBMS,OS,Networks), projects, mock interviews and body language.THE PLANEveryone is different and similarly they will have different plans of preparation but I believe they should have a few things in common:Estimate how many questions you are going to do daily which will include more than just coding the optimal solution but also understanding how the brute force solution was analyzed and optimized into the final solution ‚Äî as in interviews they will see your approach rather than your answer.Make a plan for one month atleast. Before creating your daily or weekly schedule first jot down the data structures and algorithms you are going to learn this month(I have mentioned all the important ones below).On an average you should spend atleast 3 ‚Äì 4 hours on your daily coding practice. Consistency is more important then studying 18 hours one day and 1 hour the next.The point over which most people get frustrated is that how much time I should spend on thinking about a problem before looking at the solution. The best thing to do in this case would be to first check the difficulty of the problem , if its easy spend 20 minutes , medium : 40 to 45 minutes and if its hard you can go up to 1 hour. This time should decrease as you progress .When you are making your weekly schedule on which concepts to learn make sure that you learn algorithms that go with the data structures you learned earlier. For example if you are studying Linked Lists you should complement it with the Slow Fast Runner algorithm , or if you are studying trees then Backtracking would be the best thing to study. More hints are given below.A ROUGH ESTIMATION OF %CHANCE FOR ANY OF THE ABOVE CATEGORIES TO APPEAR IN AN INTERVIEW , Photo from: bytebybyte.comDATA STRUCTURESArrays and stringsLinked ListsStacks And QueuesTreesGraphsALGORITHMS(Broad Division)Recursion.Dynamic ProgrammingSorting and SearchingMiscellaneousRECURSIONBacktrackingBreath First and Depth First SearchTopological SortArticulation Points in a GraphBridges In a GraphDynamic ProgrammingLongest Sub-sequence/Sub-stringLeventshein/Edit Distance0 ‚Äî 1 Knapsack ProblemMinimum PartitionSorting and SearchingBinary SearchQuick SortMerge SortKMP algorithmRabin Karp AlgorithmMiscellaneousSlow-Fast RunnerImplement an array using 3 stacksSort a stack using another stack then optimize to O(1) space complexity.METHOD OF WRITINGTechnical interviews generally require two things of its employees, solving the problem asked and with equal importance the way in which the interviewee writes the code. While writing one should keep the following things in mind:Methods should be written within class definitions.In an ideal case, you should have no blocks defined globally. That is. all switch statements, try-catch, for-each, while-loops, etc. should be written inside a method or a function.Good code should be meaningful in terms of variable names, function/method names, and class names.Functions should use names that its intent properly-what it does, why it exists, and how it is used.P.S: It is recommended if one can explain their thought process by executing a test case of their own as they explain the code.CORE CONCEPTSDBMSAs far as placements are concerned, companies need all-rounder candidates. Every CS engineer must have basic knowledge of databases.Operating SystemsOperating system interview questions are mostly focused on process management(fork()), CPU scheduling algorithms, difference between a process and a thread, critical solution problem(mutex and semaphore) and memory management in operating systems.NETWORKSYou should focus on concepts like network layers , subnets and supernet conversions.PROJECTSThis sections generally covers 15% of one‚Äôs technical interviews. Even though its a small portion its still pretty important. If you are still confused on what projects you should make , I have some pointers which will help set you on the right path:-Have at least one project in the domain that you are most interested in, even projects created after taking help from courses works as long as you understand the underlying concepts.Choose your tech stack wisely as you may be asked the reason behind your choice and why you discarded other similar technologies.Learn the basics of the technologies that you have used and why they are better than other similar tech, as they will test your foundation on the languages and technologies you have used.P.S. Although most interviews of companies wont focus on projects when hiring undergrads but there always are a few exceptions. Thus its better to have more guns in your arsenal.MOCK INTERVIEWSFrankly you should do these atmost 1 month before your interviews. The most important advantage of giving mocks is that it helps you strengthen your nerves and give you a better idea of the playing field, boost your confidence and more. 2‚Äì3 mocks are sufficient enough. Check out reference 3‚Äî personal recommendation.BODY LANGUAGE & INTERACTIONSThis is a very integral part of interviews. Your first impression can be the factor that makes you get or lose the job. It is a tacit form of expression which reveals whether the interviewee is confident, goal-oriented and many other things that cannot be understood from questions alone.Another important thing to remember is to think before you speak. Interviewers generally conduct the interview as a long conversation so they will ask questions based on your answers. So think carefully before answering as blurting out something you do not know will only lead to your downfall.FINAL NOTEI just want to say one last thing for each section you will have several sections to check from but don‚Äôt let the abundance of options ever tie you down. Select a few and use those resources till the end.References:Cracking the coding interview- this only book I ever needed: https://amzn.to/3l40nbehttps://www.dailycodingproblem.com/ (Amazing site sends you a well curated list of problems , one every day )https://www.byte-by-byte.com/ (Check out this blog if you want ot be posted on what happens in the interviews industry).https://www.pramp.com/#/sign-in(Good site for practicing mock interviews)Written byrishav ghoshFull Stack Engineer.

VIT Placement Procedure,https://medium.com/placementprep-aryagswm/vit-placement-procedure-8867b44930cd?source=tag_archive---------8-----------------------,"Interview,Interview Tips,Interview Preparation,Placement,Codelikeagirl","Hey Everyone! According to me, along with the preparation, one must know about placement procedure in their campus. VIT placement procedure is pretty simple, along with minor surprises.First of all, different companies like Amazon, Visa, RBS, American Express, BNY, Deloitte, DE Shaw, Exxonmobil, HPE, JP Morgan, Microsoft, Morgan Stanley, Motor Q, TVS Utkarsh, Virtusa visited campus for summer internship for students in their sixth semester. (P.S.: I‚Äôll be posting about each companies‚Äô selection procedure soon).These companies give PPO(Pre Placement Offer) to the interns in the month of July- August who have performed well in their internship.PAT registration starts in the end of February or the beginning of March for third year students where students have to pay around Rs. 7000/- for registration. A workshop is conducted by PAT office for the registered students. All the rules and regulations are explained. Different training companies like Ethnus, Face, Smart give presentation to invite students to register for training under them. You have to choose one of them for placement training purpose.SDOT training is conducted for preparing students for placements in the month of March or April (not very sure about this, since during this time my batch was back at home due to COVID-19).VIT Placement Procedure4. After summer vacation, now comes the actual placement procedure.5. In the month of July, when students are back in campus, different companies start visiting.6. First of all, slot1 companies like Amazon, Udaan, PayPal, AppD, Morgan Stanley, DE Shaw, WorkIndia visit the campus. These companies have the highest CTC.7. Super Dream companies like Cloudera, Cisco, Wells Fargo, Societe Generale , Neilsen etc.. come for recruitment purposes followed by dream companies.8. Coming to the rules and regulations of PAT office:If you are selected for any super dream company, no matter what the CTC is, you can not sit for any other company.. not even other super dream company with higher pay.If you are selected for super dream internship, you can sit only for dream companies and IT Services Companies Placements. Six months internship usually converts to FTE. I know it‚Äôs risky, but this is how it is.Refer the following eligibility regulations set by PAT Office.9. As far as I know, very few core companies come for placement for branches like Civil and Mechanical. But they can participate in the hackerrank coding test held by VIT for Non CS, IT students. Top scorers are allowed to sit for placement in companies recruiting CS- IT students.10. Now comes the few surprises I was talking about:Different companies have different CGPA criteria for eligibility. Mostly 7 or 7.5. But many times PAT office shortlists students with CGPA more than 8.5 and many times 9 also, specially for slot1 and some super dream companies. No shortlisting queries are entertained by PAT office.Due to COVID-19, the entire placement procedure till now is being conducted online which makes it more difficult. Tests are being conducted on Hackerrank which gives more difficult set of questions. So, All the best if you have online tests on hackerrank.You will be receiving a lot of mails from PAT Office and you need to see each one of them. So, install Campus Interaction on your phone and keep your phone with you at all times.Lastly, many times, luck plays its hand and boom‚Ä¶ you are placed when you least expect it. So, don‚Äôt be demotivated.. you‚Äôll figure out things along the way and many companies are coming.. so keep on grinding.I hope I have covered most of the things about the overall placement procedure. If anyone has any queries, feel free to leave a comment and I‚Äôll address it as soon as possible.If you want me to blog about a particular aspect of placement, do reach out to me and I‚Äôll post about it by the next day.I wish All the best to all the aspirants out there!

RBS: Royal Bank of Scotland,https://medium.com/placementprep-aryagswm/rbs-royal-bank-of-scotland-e425ac793ba8?source=tag_archive---------9-----------------------,"Interview,Interview Tips,Placement,Royal Bank Of Scotland,Code","Hey Everyone!RBS, Royal Bank of Scotland (now re-branded as NatWest Group) visited VIT campus in the month of August to offer summer internships to 3rd years and full time employment offers to 4th years.I took part in the internship drive and I am sharing my experience here. Short listing was done prior to the online exam based on CGPA.First Round:First round was an online test conducted on mettl platform, which was a mixture of technical MCQs, aptitude, quantitative ability and coding questions. Technical MCQs were mainly based on data structures and algorithms, OOPS concepts, DBMS and OS. There were 2 coding questions, one was easy and another was of medium level. I solved 2 questions completely and did technical MCQs well. I was able to solve around 70% of aptitude and quants questions.Around 100 people took the test, 43 were shortlisted for the next round.Second round:After the first round, there was a pre-placement talk for the shortlisted students held by the company post which we had the second round.This round was a written round. We were given 2 questions which we had to solve and write code within the allotted time of 20 minutes.Question 1: Find the nth root of a number correct up to 3 places of decimals, without using any in-built functions.Question 2: An unsorted array and a value x are given. Find 4 values of array (quadruplets) whose sum is equal to the given value x. An array should be returned in which the quadruplets are in sorted order.After this round, around 10‚Äì15 were shortlisted for personal interview.Third round:There were two interviewers and they were very supportive and friendly. They introduced themselves to me first and asked me to introduce myself. I was asked to explain the questions solved in the second round. We discussed my solutions, the interviewer asked me to come up with a better solution with better time complexity. He also gave hints and added few corrections to my code. After this, he started asking technical questions on the programming languages that I mentioned on my resume and computer networks (As I did a certification course on Computer Networking). There was in-depth discussion on one of my projects, he asked me to explain the entire flow of the project and questions followed. He also asked questions on DBMS and OS concepts, I was asked to write 2 to 3 SQL queries. Questions on multi-threading and machine learning basics followed.Once they were done with technical questions, they asked questions testing leadership ability, team and change management what seemed like a pro-fit/HR round.Some of the questions..¬∑ Did you work in a team before? What do you think is the most important quality one should possess to lead a team?¬∑ What do you know about RBS and why do you want to join RBS?¬∑ Tell us a situation where you had to undergo a drastic ‚Äòchange‚Äô and how did you manage it?¬∑ Where do you see yourself in 5 years?Finally 5 students were selected for the internship!!Some tips!Focus on basics of core CS subjects and be sure of all the things mentioned in your resume. Be confident and articulate your thoughts clearly to the interviewer. Always ask questions at the end when interviewer asks ‚Äî ‚ÄòDo you have any questions for me?‚ÄôAll the best :))-Krishna ManmayiI hope the article helped all the students out there. Congratulations Manmayi and thank you so much for providing us with such insights. We all wish you good luck for future endeavours.Upcoming Post: Day1 in 30 Days of DSA Preparation, Microsoft Selection Procedureplacement_preparationIncoming SDE Intern at Amazon || Ex-ACMS mentee at AmazonFollow30 InterviewInterview TipsPlacementRoyal Bank Of ScotlandCode30¬†claps30¬†clapsWritten byArya GoswamiFollowIncoming SDE intern at Amazon || Ex- mentee at Amazon ACMSFollowplacement_preparationFollowHelping beginners to pace up for placement preparationsFollowWritten byArya GoswamiFollowIncoming SDE intern at Amazon || Ex- mentee at Amazon ACMSplacement_preparationFollowHelping beginners to pace up for placement preparationsMore From MediumWhat‚Äôs happening around the future of work: Drivers, trends, and opportunitiesLerer Hippeau in Lerer HippeauA Simple Trick To Improve Any Pitch Or PresentationAaron Dinin, PhD in The StartupIt‚Äôs Time To Rethink The 40-Hour WorkweekJoe Coad II in The StartupHow to Scale and Grow as a PM?Arpana Prajapati in Women In Product BlogsToxic TaskulinityMike Sturm in The StartupQuitting a job after only one monthThom GalletWomen in STEM: The importance of diversity and inclusivityDigital Leaders in Digital LeadersWhen Illness Leads to Bullying at WorkRee Jackson in Reject RevolutionLearn more.Medium is an open platform where 170 million readers come to find insightful and dynamic thinking."
Kickstart your Career before Campus Placements,https://medium.com/@1729249/kickstart-your-career-before-campus-placements-1bac37d11379?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Unitedhealth Group,Placement,Internships,Experience,Tips And Tricks","Job Hunting is a very frustrating aspect of student life. Campus Placements are often gruesome for an upcoming engineer which leaves students frustrated for months. So, here let us discuss the policy of how an early bird catches the worm and start with our preparations as early as possible.Addressing some FAQ‚ÄôS and Myths:-So really, how can a student get placed in an Engineering College before the actual placements?The answer to this question is Pre Placement Offers through Internships.I got my Internship offer from Optum Global Solutions in 3rd year(5th semester). It was a 2 months internship which occurred virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I was offered my Pre Placement Offer after the successful completion of my internship.I had also received another internship offer from High Radius in my 6th-semester which I had to leave after 1.5 months to join the previously mentioned company.What are the different types of Internships? In which year of college are students offered internships?Internships are broadly classified as Technical and Non- Technical ones.Technical Internships are the ones that are related to your branch or field while Non- Technical Internships are the ones that include Creative Skills like Digital Marketing, working for an NGO, Creative Writing, Blogging, etc.Coming to technical skills students are suggested to do at least one technical internship with a start-up or any other conglomerate. These internships can generally be found on Linkedin or Internshala. Students can gain a vast amount of technical skills in working in these startups. Start checking for the skills required by the startups on 2nd year of college and prepare accordingly for the role. The Internships take place mostly in the summer break or winter break, but some times they last longer than expected and clash with the college schedule. Time Management is the key to such a case. I would suggest anyone to try to get internships in a start-up in the semester break between 2nd and 3rd year of college.The Companys which offer Internships along with Pre Placement Offers has internship drives throughout 3rd year to the beginning of 4th year. The Companies which came to our College for Internship Drives are:- Optum, Dell, Reliance Jio, Coviam, and Maya Data for 3rd-year students. For 4th-year students, high range companies like VM Ware, Autodesk, Nutanix, and Informatica visited our campus to date.One can also try for off-campus internships in 3rd as well as 4th year. Companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Goldman- Sachs conduct off-campus recruitment drives for 3rd year as well as 4th year. Check the Job Sections of these company websites every 2 weeks to check for any updates. Also, check other websites and Linkedin posts for regular updates.Companies offering Pre Placement Offers along with Internships can be of 3 types:-Internships with Confirmed PPO- This is generally offered by companies in 4th year.Internships with Conditional PPO- The PPO will be offered along with the Internship but can be terminated on the basis of performance throughout the term.Internships with Performance-Based PPO- In this case you are selected for the internship and the company will constantly monitor your progress based on your progress. There may be chances of other tests and interviews for the PPO offer.Are internships mandatory for campus placements?No, not at all. Internships are important but not mandatory. The person sitting in front of you will judge you on the basis of your ability to learn, quick thinking, knowledge, and decision-making skills, not just some internships.From when should I start preparing for the Internship? Some tips and ResourcesCoding Basics and DSA should be clear by the end of 3rd sem.Coding in competitive coding platforms like Hackerrank, HackerEarth, Code Chef, and Leet Code should be started by the 4th sem.Practice whatever code comes on your way this will increase your flexibility on problem-solving ability, instead of being confined to coding platforms.Open Source Platforms like Medium, Geeks for Geeks are very helpful for clearing concepts.Clear the fundamental concepts of the core subjects. Subjects like Computer Networking, Operating System, DSA, DBMS, and Applications of DAA are very important for placement as well as an internship recruitment perspective.Choose a Domain, clear concepts from that domain, and try to make 1‚Äì2 projects on it.Start preparing for a company by checking the role offered. Geeks for Geeks has an extensive collection of people sharing their experiences for every company and profile.Regular Aptitude practice either from a book or from Open Sources like www.indiabix.com, https://www.careerride.com/. Also, try practicing from books like R.S Agarwal and Fast Track Mathematics by Arihant. The key to ace in Aptitude in speed and practice, so I would suggest giving a mixed bag test of aptitude at least once in a month.CGPA matters. Not extensively but it does matter. For a student in a private college, one should try and maintain a CGPA above 8.5.Soft Skills are important. Good speaking skills are an added advantage during an interview.Websites like Javatpointand GeeksforGeeks have an extensive collection of interview preparation questions, try using those.11. The Internet is your friend most of the questions and queries are already there you only need proper keywords to ask.12. Most of the time, the interviews for internships as well as placements have the level of difficulty the only difference will be the syllabus if you are in 3rd year vs if you are in 4th year.13. Every word you write in your resume should be set on your brain, and be prepared to be questioned on it. If you are not confident about a project or a topic skip writing it.What to expect from an industrial internship?An industrial internship can be of either of the following types:-A training program in which interns will be given the opportunity to learn new evolving technology.To work on an industrial project. The new technologies are to be learned while creating projects.Tips for getting PPO in a performance-based Internship.First of all, yes an intern has to shed lots of blood sweat, and tears to get a PPO. There can be two ways of evaluating interns from my two internship experiences:-On the basis of constant monitoring and checking of your progress. This happens in the case of industrial project-based internships. In this case, you have to report to your senior after each deadline.The second is as in the case of Training based internships, formal tests and interviews are taken to access your knowledge.Getting PPO is tough as you have to compete with students from not only your college but with people throughout our country. But, if you take the internship seriously and complete all the tasks in time with proper explanations and knowledge you will be converted as a full-timer.If I don‚Äôt get a Pre Placement Offer from my Internship?Though it will be devastating for you, it is not the end of the world. You can still opt for Campus Placements if they are still ongoing. Otherwise, try for off-campus placements. Yes, it will be challenging but it is a risk worth taking. The knowledge and experience that you have gained from the Internship will give you an edge over other students.Lastly, Believe in yourself.Dream big. Set goals. Work Hard.Never ever give up in life.

Can we develop new skills through online courses?,https://medium.com/dev-genius/can-we-develop-new-skills-through-online-courses-daf63e23e649?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Self Learning,Online Courses,Colleges And Universities,Placement,Data Science Courses","Generally, we used to spend money on new courses to explore a new interest or to develop a professional skill. There are many out there in the world who can‚Äôt afford the courses. Today, I am going to discuss ‚ÄúCan we develop new skills through online courses‚Äù. I am computer science student.so, I will discuss in the view of tech skillsBefore entering into discussion, you should get to know about few things which we often consider as a prerequisite, but it‚Äôs actually not. There are many things which are overratedThings that are overratedCertificatesCollege EducationPackagesCertificates: These are a piece of papers which costs nearly everything our parents save or your earnings. We are in 21st century, every company you apply for or company you dreamt of working in asks you for skill set and how good you are at it. It‚Äôs not the case that ‚ÄúThis person has a certificate from prestigious platform, we should hire him/her‚Äù. They themselves certify you by asking some questions/keeping some industrial scenarios before you. Which can‚Äôt be certified/judged by a piece of paper.College Education: Everyone thinks that if they join in a prestigious college and rest is taken care of by ‚ÄúBrand Factor‚Äù. I myself being a college student can state that ‚ÄúColleges are overrated‚Äù. The only thing college can do better than online courses is, it introduces to an environment where you get know about various cultures and how to behave with different types of persons. When it comes to teaching, I prefer self-learning and online learning with 24/7 assistance.Colleges go with their own speed. It‚Äôs impossible for them to make every student understand. So, the Fast Learners are wasting their time in which they can opt for other courses. Slow learners need some more time to understand that. But Colleges have fixed time for a semester.Packages: I have seen many people jumping into the domain they are not interested in/Entering into the college with high fees for the sake of good payroll. After doing so, they may sometimes have to regret it.This happens mostly because of pressure from parents. People start judging you if they see you deviating from the path that they have been seeing for ages. College you studied can‚Äôt judge your payroll.I have heard about people studying in tier 3 or 4 colleges and getting into MNC‚Äôs which we dreamt of with high packages.Can we develop new skills through online courses?Coming back to our main aspect. Yes, we can develop new skills through online courses.You have to do lot of research before taking course. You shouldn‚Äôt judge a course considering the cost or brand factor.Live Experience: I want to learn ML. Without proper research I opted a course from an esteemed platform for 15,000/- rupees. I completed the course but Iam not sure about concepts they taught me, moreover they didn‚Äôt mentioned/taught me the prerequisites of the course. It‚Äôs time limited.Later on, I wanted to give an another try. While taking with my friend he mentioned about another platform. where I found that they are teaching me start from the basics like python, SQL and NoSQL, Flask, Statistics, ML, DL, NLP and Chatbot projects. The course comes with placement assistance,30 projects. Cost of this course was around 3k to 4k INR.How to choose a course?Check whether it starts from the basics.Research about the course and the instructor.Check whether it is budget friendly.Check whether it is time limited or life time access course.It should contain projectsTry to consider a course having placement assistance (not placement guarantee) and live support and doubt clearing sessions.What if you are unable to find the courses in your budget?Just go to youtube.com. YouTube is the one of the best sources available mostly to everyone. The problem with YouTube is it‚Äôs not in the ordered/categorized manner. What you can do is:copy the syllabus of the course from the platform which you consider the best.Try to find the best YouTube sources for the skill you want to learn.Try to make your own playlist of them.Try to join communities. So that if you have doubt you can get help from them.Try to connect to people in LinkedIn.Try to keep in touch with them, maybe some of them can assist you for career.Dev GeniusCoding, Tutorials, News, UX, UI and much more related to developmentFollow18 Sign up for Best StoriesBy Dev GeniusThe best stories sent monthly to your email.¬†Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don‚Äôt already have one.

So make sure your resume is extremely honest. It is better to leave out a project if you think you don‚Äôt know it well and won‚Äôt be able to learn by the time the interview process starts, rather than blanking during the process.PreparationI started preparing for placements at the end of July, after coming back to college. I practiced the majority of the questions from InterviewBit. If I was not confident about a particular topic, then I practiced those questions on GeeksforGeeks and Leetcode. There were also weekly aptitude tests conducted on Pariksha, I was not really regular, but tried to practice as much as possible.One of my observations during the tests was the balance between MCQs and coding questions. MCQs would be based on OOPS, OS, aptitude and sometimes probability. Some companies also asked DBMS and some even asked SQL queries. Its not important to have knowledge of each of those topics; prioritise depending upon the kind of profile you are aiming for. In any case, make sure you know OOPS very very well. Hypothetically, say there are 3 coding questions and 30 mcqs, and you have 1.5 hours to solve. So if out of 3 coding questions 2 are of a medium level and the other is very hard, most people won‚Äôt be able to solve the third question. In such cases the shortlist is decided by the MCQs. This may not always be the case, but I guess you get my point.‚ÄúAs important as it is to practice enough before the tests, it is even more important to learn from your mistakes during the tests.‚ÄùMake a note of the topics you faced difficulty in, come back with those doubts and make sure those are clarified before you head for the next day. There are ample companies which visit our campus, so even if you mess up one of the tests, don‚Äôt lose hope. To keep myself motivated, I maintained a list of the companies whose tests went well. To cope with any anxiety, I made myself a safety cushion, a list of some companies whose tests went well and are not very rigorous in their interview process. Do whatever it takes, whether it is stress eating, stress shopping, revising or coding. Do enough to make yourself feel confident; that is what matters at the end of the day.Along with coding, I reviewed probability, solved puzzles. I really did not prepare exclusively for quant roles. One of the other things that I also noticed was the length of the questions. Some questions are a really long read and the examples given with the question can be misleading, so make sure you have enough practice of such questions and avoid wasting time in understanding the problem statement. If the question was more than one paragraph long, I used to make note of important points on paper, short/one-word bullet points.InterviewComing to the interview, the shortlist for JPMC was released less than 12 hours beforehand. I used most of that time to keep myself calm; in fact, I binge watched friends and slept for most part of it. I wanted to keep myself calm and retain mental as well as physical strength for coming day(s).The interview process had 5 rounds: 4 technical and one HR round. In the first interview I was asked questions on probability. In the next round were a coding question and a puzzle. The interviewer asked me to give an answer to the puzzle which was different than GeeksforGeeks. I asked him if I could code it, he happily agreed. After he was happy with the code, he asked me a couple of more puzzles, and also asked me if I had seen them before. I was honest and told him that I had, which he really appreciated and he let me off for other rounds.‚ÄúCompanies value ethics more than we realise as college students.‚ÄùIn the third round, the interviewer was really intimidating, but at the end of the round, he made me pretty comfortable to answer his questions without any fear. He asked me some more probability questions and some integrations from JEE syllabus. In the fourth round, I was asked two more questions on probability, out of which, one I couldn‚Äôt understand. She said we could skip the question and moved on to discuss my resume. I was also asked a proof of a algorithm, which I couldn‚Äôt fully derive, but she was pretty happy with the approach.After the fourth round, they immediately told me I could go for the HR round. HR round was pretty much standard questions. Why JPMC, where do you see yourself in 5 years, what questions do you have for us, one example where you demonstrated team work, discussed PORs.So, at the end the things which worked for me during the interview were :1. Communication Skills : While solving any question, I made sure to speak what I was thinking, so that the interviewer was aware of my thought process. Also make sure you are humble and at no point rude to the interviewer (ofcourse, if he/she is being unfair you can make a noisy exit politely).2. Honesty : Most of the optimal answers to puzzles are not that obvious that one could reach to a solution within 2‚Äì3 minutes. So if you have seen a problem before, never lie about it.3. Resume : I was well versed with my resume, so any conversation around it went pretty smooth.Other than this, please prioritize during interviews. Make sure you don‚Äôt spend too much time on one company and then lose time for the rest of the slot. If you don‚Äôt see hope, and their interviews are really long, politely excuse yourself, and have a friend keeping check for your turn. Stay hydrated during the entire process, keep friends by your side, rock that beautiful smile on your face and you‚Äôll kill it!All the best and Happy coding!InPlaceThe go-to article series for internship and placement preparation.Follow440 PlacementCollegeJpmorgan ChaseIit GuwahatiInterview440¬†claps440¬†clapsWritten byCepstrumFollowStudent Body of Department of EEE, IITGFollowInPlaceFollowInPlace is the flagship publication of Cepstrum, IITG.

Internships & Placement: How it changed the way I look at life,https://medium.com/@vaibhavberiwal/internships-placement-how-it-changed-the-way-i-look-at-life-3c6f739895d8?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Internships,Placement,Preparation,Mental Health,Life Lessons","I see a lot of people depressed worrying about internships and placements. I know how it feels when you are not able to perform according to others‚Äô expectations (and your own) because I have been there. Through this article I just want to share my journey and some key takeaways through those experiences with my juniors.Internship Experience:I had done one internship with an MnC in the second year, had a C.G.P.A of 8.5+, had one of the best PORs, but still could not secure a CDC (Career Development Center, the body responsible for organizing campus internships and placement) Internship. I hardly got shortlisted for any interviews, and for a few companies where I did, I couldn‚Äôt get through. Like every other student, I had very high hopes, when the CDC process had started. I was confident that I would be able to do well. But this changed quickly ‚Äî just after a few days I was completely hopeless and had lost all confidence in myself.I wasted a lot of time in my 3rd year just ranting about how unfair the whole CDC process was, how undeserving candidates were selected but deserving candidates were not, etc. Guess what? None of that helped!Soon I realized my biggest mistake ‚Äî Instead of focusing on what could I do to improve myself, and where did I go wrong, I was just wasting my time blaming different people and the circumstances for my ‚Äúfailure‚Äù. I had wasted so much time just being depressed and doing nothing. I am sure that if I had utilized all this time to work on improving myself, I could have avoided going through that dark phase of depression and hopelessness. But then I talked to some seniors, started working on my weaknesses, did a 1-month winter internship in December and started applying off-campus for summer internships through LinkedIn. Finally after applying to several companies, I had multiple summer internship offers by March, went ahead with one of them and received a Pre-Placement Offer after the internship.A few things which I learned through this incident:Life isn‚Äôt fair:This quote by Harvey Mackay beautifully summarizes the learning: ‚ÄúLife isn‚Äôt fair. It‚Äôs true, and you still have to deal with it. Whining about it rarely levels the playing field, but learning to rise above it is the ultimate reward.‚Äù You have to accept this fact and stop expecting life to be fair to you every time. Everyone has their bad days, but if you keep trying, work on your weaknesses, and have a little patience, your hard work will pay off.Stop comparing yourself with others. This is the most powerful key to happiness:I realized that the prime reason for my depression was not because I wasn‚Äôt able to get a CDC internship, but because many of my friends/peers had and I could not. Never forget that there will always be someone who is better than you at something (or better off than you). Thus relative comparison is bound to make you unhappy. Comparing yourself with someone else is like comparing an apple with an orange because every individual is a function of their unique set of experiences and thus different. If you really want to compare, compare your present with your past and ask yourself ‚Äî Are you a better person today than you were yesterday? That is all that matters.Day 1 or Day 2 or Day N doesn‚Äôt matter:What really matters is the kind of work you do, what values it adds to you, and how much you like the work you are doing during your internship. Even with an off-campus internship, I got a chance to work on really cool projects, which added value and which I really enjoyed working on. On the other hand, I have friends who secured a CDC internship but did not enjoy their work at all and hardly added any value. Don‚Äôt get me wrong here, I am not asking you to stop trying for a Day 1/Day 2/Day N CDC internship, my point is that getting/not getting it is not the end. Even when you sit for CDC placements, though having an intern with ‚ÄúXYZ Company‚Äù in your CV might help in forming a good first impression, no company would hire you just because you interned in that company. The CV based interview discussions would be based primarily on the work you did, your learnings during the internship, the impact of your work, etc. and this would ultimately decide how well your interview goes.If you are good at something, you will eventually be rewarded: I seriously began doubting myself even after trying so hard was not being able to secure an internship. But then at the end, I had multiple internship offers in my hand. Also, I was offered a PPO (verbally by my manager) just after completing 1 month during my 2.5 months internship. I hadn‚Äôt even completed the internship yet and the manager wanted to have me in their team as a full-time employee! Moral of the story ‚Äî Your hard work will pay-off, your skills will be valued, nothing would go waste if you don‚Äôt give up and keep fighting.Placement Journey:My placement journey is particularly interesting because I got placed in one of the most unexpected ways in the most unexpected company. Although such instances are not rare because a lot of unexpected things happen during campus internships/placements and you might find a lot of such amazing stories.The placement semester becomes really hectic, especially after the tests begin. If you are sitting for a software profile, then you would be having multiple tests most of the days. Even otherwise, you will have to manage tests, working on your weaknesses, preparing for the interviews and academics, all at the same time. The pressure really started building up when the first few initial shortlists came out and I could not find my name in any of them. I would like to share 2 contrasting incidents which took place with me:I had appeared for the test of a data science company which was one of my top 5 target companies and it went really well, probably the best among all tests I had given. I had solved all the coding questions correctly and performed reasonably well in the aptitude section too. My profile was a perfect match with the job description, I had a C.G.P.A of 8.5+, the test went really well (both in absolute and relative terms) and naturally I had really high hopes. The company released a shortlist of 100+ people (which is rare) for the interviews and guess what, my name wasn‚Äôt there. This was really depressing to be honest, but nothing could be done, I just had to accept it and move on. Learning: Always be prepared for facing rejectionsOn the other hand, I was shortlisted for some companies where I wasn‚Äôt even expecting to get shortlisted because the test had gone pretty average, nothing exceptional.Learning: Never lose hope, just give your best because you might get shortlisted in the most unexpected places.Placement Interview experience:I was shortlisted for one company on Day 1 and the interviews started from 6 a.m and we were standing outside the interview room in Nalanda Classroom Complex waiting for our turn. The people who had multiple shortlists on that day were given preference to give the interview first probably so that they don‚Äôt miss other interviews. Though this seems fair, it was not. My turn for the first round came around 10 a.m (after standing outside for 4 hours). By this time many people had completed multiple rounds of interviews and had also received their offers (even before I gave my first round). My interview looked just like a formality and the interviewer was least interested to hear my answers (he was yawning on my face).Fast forward to 4 p.m in the evening ‚Äî I was in my room, preparing for the next day interviews when I noticed a company was continuously releasing extended shortlists which meant they did not find suitable candidates. My name was not there in the shortlist but I contacted the placecomm (student placement committee member) handling the company to ask if there is a possibility of a walk in interview. They asked me to come to Nalanda with my CV, in case such a thing happens. I immediately dressed and went to Nalanda and handed over my resume to the placecomm. I was confident that I will make it through if I get a chance to interview because my internship work/profile was aligned with the company‚Äôs work. My CV reached the recruiter and he was impressed with my CV but I was rejected (not even given a chance to sit for the interview) saying that they were not looking to hire B.Techs, only Dual Degree students. This was disappointing, but by this time because of my previous experiences, I had learned how to deal with rejections.I was tired and had slept by midnight but I received a call at 1:48 a.m from a friend who called to inform me that my name was there in the extended shortlist for a company and the interview was scheduled to start after 4 hours at 6 a.m. I was not even sure if I wanted to work for that company and had many other shortlists on the same day. Nonetheless, I went for the interview just for the experience. While waiting for my turn, I found out more about the company and the profile the company was offering and really liked it, though I still did not have much expectations because I wasn‚Äôt well prepared for that interview. Unlike other interviews, I wasn‚Äôt nervous this time because I wasn‚Äôt expecting much. This fact really brought out the best inside me, I could answer all questions naturally without any performance pressure. Guess what, one round after the other and I was immediately offered the position after my final round of interview.I am really thankful to all my friends and seniors who helped me during my entire journey. Right from helping me make my CV to helping me with all my doubts, with mock interview sessions, informing me about the right opportunities at the right time and most importantly for providing me the constant mental support without which nothing would have been possible!Q) If you are not a Phase 1/Day 1 person in the CDC, what should be your approach for the coming days?Ans) First of all, you should not lose hope and keep trying your best no matter which day or which phase. There are some good companies which come later on as well.However, you need to identify your weaknesses, understand what are the things you are not doing right, and work towards those. Simultaneously, you should start preparing yourself for applying off-campus and not just be dependent on CDC to get you an intern. There are majorly 3 ways for applying off-campus-Through your personal contacts ‚Äî relatives, friends or anyone who can refer you in some companyThrough seniors, mentors, or alumni (warm contacts)Through cold emailing/ LinkedIn/ applying directly on the company website (I had secured my off-campus internship through LinkedIn)For more help regarding applying off-campus, don‚Äôt hesitate in approaching your seniors.Be well informed about everything. Don‚Äôt fall for rumors/myths. Always try to base your decisions on facts and not perceptions. Because facts are universally true, perceptions change from person to person. Take guidance from seniors who have already gone through the process. It‚Äôs advisable to talk to many different seniors because everyone has a unique experience and a different perspective. Message seniors even if you don‚Äôt know them personally, most seniors would be willing to help you out.Q). What was your Go to Mantra in your mind before every CDC test/interview?Ans) I tried to be well informed about the kind of questions that are generally asked by that company ‚Äî both for tests and interviews. This helped me to be mentally prepared. However, always be ready to face something new, and don‚Äôt panic if you get something unexpected during the test/interview. Apart from this, the two things which helped me the most are-Confidence: No matter what, I always try to walk into the test/interview room with confidence. If you go in with a feeling that you are under-prepared or that there are better people competing against you and hence you can‚Äôt make it through, then you will never be able to get through. Honestly you can‚Äôt be 100% prepared for any test or interview, because there is no well defined syllabus and you could be asked anything. So you just need to go with a positive mindset and give your best.Expectations: I leave behind all expectations when I enter the exam hall or interview room and this attitude has helped me a lot both during internships and placements. Because more often than not, expectations are accompanied by a fear of not getting what you want. This adds a lot of pressure and stops you from giving your best.Also, I personally believe in not discussing the paper with others after the test is over, especially if you have more tests scheduled later on the same day. This is because if you get to know that many people could solve a particular question and you could not, or you realize that you made a silly mistake, etc. it just adds to the mental pressure and you unnecessarily carry the load into the next test. What you can do is try to solve the questions which you could not during the test or find their solutions at the end of the day or maybe the next day whenever you get time.Q. How was preparing for CDC and academics simultaneously like? Did that hamper your mental health?Ans) It was a very difficult phase for me because there were so many things going on at the same time ‚Äî CDC preparation + tests, academics, society meetings and hall activities. I think time management becomes extremely crucial in such situations. If you don‚Äôt prioritize things and plan properly, it becomes not only physically exhausting but mentally exhausting as well. I clearly remember that I had stopped hanging out with friends, I had stopped doing things I loved and I just wasn‚Äôt myself anymore. But this just worsened the situation. I realized that it‚Äôs really important to find some time everyday for yourself and spend some time doing things you love to do otherwise your mental health will take a toll. Having a peaceful mental state is equally important because it directly affects all your thoughts behavior and action. Though there are no set guidelines that work for everyone, here are some thing which works for me and helps me in staying mentally strong.Meditation: Even a small 10‚Äì15 minute session everyday works like wonders for me. It helps me remove all the negativity, stress and helps me stay in the moment rather than worrying about the future. Definitely worth trying for a few days and experiencing the results.Finding a mentor in the form of a friend or a senior: Having someone with whom you can share all your problems and someone who can guide you, help you find solutions to your problem significantly reduces the unnecessary stress.Finding time to do things which make you happy: No matter how busy your day was, you should find at least some time doing things you love. This breaks the monotony of work and keeps you cheerful and motivated.Sleep: I make sure that I sleep early and wake up early at least once a week. Sleeping early not only helps me in getting enough sleep, it also helps in waking up with a fresh and positive mind. In addition, at least for me I have observed that most of the negative thoughts and worrying comes when I am awake late at night, and thus sleeping on time helps me avoid these negative thoughts. Easier said than done, but it also helps if you can maintain a proper sleep cycle and avoid sleeping and waking up at random times of the day.I would like to end by sharing this simple yet amazing flowchart which I refer to whenever I am stressed about something.Source: Google ImagesWritten byVaibhav BeriwalData Science Enthusiast!

How to start with Placements Interview Preparation and my Interview Experience with American Express.,https://blog.usejournal.com/how-to-start-with-placements-interview-preparation-and-my-interview-experience-with-american-ce072c981c5e?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"Java,Placement,American Express,Competitive Programming,Interview","Hey Amigos. So in this article I will be telling you all about my competitive coding journey and how did I prepare for my interviews which ultimately handed me a 6 months internship at American Express.It can become a bit long so bear with me XDHaving a proper road-map is very important as one can have thousands of ways to achieve a target but which way to follow and when, is what makes the difference. You can practice coding questions from many different sites but its better that you take 1‚Äì2 sites and practice from them properly and in depth.Start by taking a DSA course on GeeksForGeeks and solve all the questions in each and every track . Yes all !! . Simultaneously you have to solve the questions on LeetCode . Between Java or C++ you can chose any as the languages matter only sometimes but logic matters the most.So at the end of your placement season your LeetCode profile and GfG profile should look somewhat like this.Now as you start solving the questions do maintain a repository on Github or anywhere you are comfortable at. Keep pushing the codes you write to Github.GitHub link for my repository of all the codes I had written until now:Want to read this story later? Save it in Journal.ATRI2107/JAVA-CODESIt's my collection of all important competitive programming codes written as practice uptill now for a quick revision‚Ä¶github.comDo star the repository if you like it and I am open for pull requests as well :-). Having a well maintained repository helped me a lot in revising my codes over the period of time. Sharing my commits over this period of time.A Snapshot of my contributions while preparation.The above stated things will be needful for DSA preparation.The important topics to cover here areArraysLinked ListTreesGraphsDynamic ProgrammingComing on to the CSE Core Subjects part which includes Operating Systems, Database Management Systems and Computer Networks. For them doing from your university curriculum would be sufficient.Operating Systems- You can do it from Gate Smashers Youtube Channel.DBMS- Follow Knowledge gate Sanchit Jain‚Äôs channel.SQl- W3Schools.Computer Networks- Gate Smashers Youtube ChannelYou can even refer to GeeksForGeeks for more questions and theory on the above given topics.Now comes the System Design Part. Here one must remember that knowing about things and applying the same in a real life interview are two different things. One must have understanding of how things work.For System Design part you can follow Gaurav Sen‚Äôs Youtube Channel.After having read the preparation procedure I‚Äôll start with my American Express Interview Experience.First Round: It was an online round consisting of 2 sections. One was a coding section having 2 questions which needs to be solved in 30 minutes. The questions were very small and easy and can be solved without much effort. The another section consisted of 60 MCQs which needed to be solved in 45 minutes. The MCQs were easy but there was a negative marking of -0.25 and also the time and speed factor were also there. Nearly 1200 students sat for the test and 32 were shortlisted for the next round and I was one amongst them.Second Round: It was a Technical + HR Round where the technical part went for about 45 minutes and the last 15 minutes was the HR part.The Technical part consisted of 2 coding questions which were fairly easy :Code the Armstrong Number the logic.Code the logic for 2 equal Arrays- In this he asked me that what do I understand by equal Arrays. I told him certain scenarios, and he asked me code one of them.Then he asked me 3 SQL Questions which included 2 questions on Joins. I would suggest everyone to know the types of joins . Then there were 2 puzzle questions which tested your IQ.In the HR part of this round he asked me what do you know about AMEX and the role you have applied for. Then he asked me about working of credit cards since AMEX is a credit card company.After this I was called for the next round.Third Round: This round was more of an HR Round. In the technical part I was asked to explain one project in which I had most fun doing it. Then he asked me how will I go about a project launch at the company and what will be my work flow. Then I was asked why only AMEX and did I have any questions for him. To this I asked him what all is there in tech stack of AMEX.Then the HR head told us that they will be declaring the results at the end of the day.RESULT- Selected :)At the end I would suggest everyone to be calm and confident and have a positive attitude while giving the interview. Asking questions about the company is always good because it shows your interests towards the company.You can direct message me on LinkedIn for any queries or can mail me at atrichaturvedi@gmail.com .üìù Save this story in Journal.üë©‚Äçüíª Wake up every Sunday morning to the week‚Äôs most noteworthy stories in Tech waiting in your inbox.

Hidden Secret of Engg Campus Placements no-one speaks about,https://medium.com/@saharshsonu40/hidden-secret-of-engg-campus-placements-no-one-speaks-about-3e6370dc218?source=tag_archive---------4-----------------------,"Placement,Placement Preparation,Coding,Competitive Coding,Engineering Placements","MUST-READ IF YOU‚ÄôLL SIT FOR PLACEMENTS IN FUTUREI wanted to write this for a long time now. I struggled a lot understanding what placements were all about. What‚Äôs important and what‚Äôs not. Now that I‚Äôve some idea of it, I thought to write about it. These are the things people don‚Äôt usually talk about. They remain kinda secret till you actually experience them and till that moment it‚Äôs too late to do something about it.So I‚Äôll lay out these 7 golden requirements to secure job at any in-campus company you want.NOTE: your dept doesn‚Äôt really matter if you are satisfying these requirements.Communication skills?When I entered college I saw everyone talked in English fluently as if it was their first language(for some it actually was) and it didn‚Äôt help me being from the state having least literacy rate. So I thought about it and came up with a solution to improve my communication skills. I participated in as many activities I could and would indulge in conversations, debates, speeches which forced me to speak up and eventually I felt that I was a lot better than when I started. The interviewer won‚Äôt be happy if you won‚Äôt be able to communicate with them well.So improve your communication skills early in college cause you won‚Äôt get time for that later. Do it as you like but do it. (Especially for people from the North).CGPA?In my early years, my seniors told me that try to keep you CGPA above 7, this a was nice piece of advice (Although not perfect).7 is the minimum requirement for 90% companies, you won‚Äôt be eligible if your GPA is below 7. I did the same. But never really bothered to go beyond that. This had some effect on placements. Some interviewers judged me on the basis of that. I found companies prefer higher CGPA candidate.Ex : Microsoft ‚Äî 8 , Google ‚Äî 6, Amazon-7, Goldman sachs ‚Äî 6.5, Intuit ‚Äî 7, Nvidia ‚Äî 9 CGPA.So don‚Äôt just maintain your CGPA. At least keep it above 8.5 . If possible improve it even further.Data structure and Algorithms && Competitive coding This is the one thing that ticked me off the most. I didn‚Äôt like competitive coding as it had no real use. It only used to get placements and showoff in coding contests. So I didn‚Äôt do it much. Now what happened during internships blew my mind. I didn‚Äôt know about this. The companies took a coding test to filter out approx 5‚Äì20 students from 100‚Äì400 who took the test. So being not particularly good at coding I didn‚Äôt get shortlisted for interviews. That is when I found out the most important thing for placements = COMPETITIVE CODING.Why CP? Because being able to solve a question didn‚Äôt really matter in the test, it mattered who solved it in time and that‚Äôs what CP is all about. In interviews even if you mastered DSA you‚Äôll be fine but the problem is with just DSA is it‚Äôll be difficult to cross the coding round. How much is enough? I think if you are able to solve 4 questions in Codeforces you are ready for placements. For DSA some 200 questions on Leetcode is enough given you understood every question you solve.So start with competitive coding as early as possible or you‚Äôll regret it dearly. Note it won‚Äôt matter much if your DSA is strong unless you are able to coding tricky questions in a short time. It‚Äôll take at least 6‚Äì8 months to get somewhat better at CP. So start preparing early.DBMS, OOPS, OS, CN, COADatabase management system, Object-Oriented Programming Concepts, Operating Systems, Computer Networks and Computer Organization and Architecture. These are the five topics I recommend you should have by heart. Whatever you do, don‚Äôt leave them or they‚Äôll leave you. Interviewers have a very strong love for these topics and won‚Äôt be happy if you don‚Äôt share the same love. The order of importance is decreasing from left to right.So when you encounter these topics in your course make sure to study them properly, make notes, Flashcards etc. So that it may take less time to revise them before interviews.PROJECT?Your interview would expect you do have done at least one project properly in your college life. saAnd they would really be displeased if you don‚Äôt have one.So he told, do at least one project seriously where you know about all its components and can answer any questions about it.Skills?Many told me skills matter a lot and companies look for that. While this is somewhat true, It‚Äôs not necessary and most interviewers even ignore it altogether.So develop skills only if they don‚Äôt affect your GPA. You‚Äôll get plenty of skills if you do your course project seriously.Extras?A lot of people try to get into technical clubs, get special achievements like GSOC, ICPC, Google developer clubs, Google AI clubs, some ABC scholarship etc. And mention it in their resume and brag about it. This is all good and fine but only if you meet the above criteria. A person with 7 GPA or bad coding skills doesn‚Äôt need to go after these. Interviews don‚Äôt care about these if you don‚Äôt meet the minimum requirements.So focus on what‚Äôs important instead of trying to run after every fancy thing you see or hear.These are my suggestions. Someone else might have some other idea around placements. Different people tried different techniques and for some it worked, for some it didn‚Äôt and they formed their ideas around it. But these requirements are the most basic and must if anyone wants a company.I‚Äôll write another blog about my interview experiences and mention link here ________. I‚Äôve around 8 interview experiences in different companies and that‚Äôs how I‚Äôve come to these conclusions. So I hope it helps‚Ä¶ALL THE BEST :)Written bykumar saharshFollow143 143¬†143¬†PlacementPlacement PreparationCodingCompetitive CodingEngineering PlacementsMore from kumar saharshFollowMore From MediumHow to look for a job during the Coronavirus outbreakCraig Godden-Payne in The StartupTech or No Tech, Keep it Real at WorkJim Katzaman - Get Debt-Free One Family at a Time in Data Driven Investor5 Steps to Becoming a Thought Leader in Your IndustryJayson DeMersI Was A Serial Network MarketerKristina MartinDiversity & Inclusion Hopes‚Ää‚Äî‚Äänot predictions‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfor 2019Toby MildonSeven Benefits of Reading the User Manual Before Wading InFabrice BGrow Your Business by Nailing the Most Important Meeting of the WeekDebbie Madden in NewCo ShiftFive Tips for Landing a Good Job During COVID-19 RecoveryDr. Yilmaz E.

Kickstart your Career before Campus Placements,https://medium.com/@1729249/kickstart-your-career-before-campus-placements-1bac37d11379?source=tag_archive---------7-----------------------,"Unitedhealth Group,Placement,Internships,Experience,Tips And Tricks","Job Hunting is a very frustrating aspect of student life. Campus Placements are often gruesome for an upcoming engineer which leaves students frustrated for months. So, here let us discuss the policy of how an early bird catches the worm and start with our preparations as early as possible.Addressing some FAQ‚ÄôS and Myths:-So really, how can a student get placed in an Engineering College before the actual placements?The answer to this question is Pre Placement Offers through Internships.I got my Internship offer from Optum Global Solutions in 3rd year(5th semester). It was a 2 months internship which occurred virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I was offered my Pre Placement Offer after the successful completion of my internship.I had also received another internship offer from High Radius in my 6th-semester which I had to leave after 1.5 months to join the previously mentioned company.What are the different types of Internships? In which year of college are students offered internships?Internships are broadly classified as Technical and Non- Technical ones.Technical Internships are the ones that are related to your branch or field while Non- Technical Internships are the ones that include Creative Skills like Digital Marketing, working for an NGO, Creative Writing, Blogging, etc.Coming to technical skills students are suggested to do at least one technical internship with a start-up or any other conglomerate. These internships can generally be found on Linkedin or Internshala. Students can gain a vast amount of technical skills in working in these startups. Start checking for the skills required by the startups on 2nd year of college and prepare accordingly for the role. The Internships take place mostly in the summer break or winter break, but some times they last longer than expected and clash with the college schedule. Time Management is the key to such a case. I would suggest anyone to try to get internships in a start-up in the semester break between 2nd and 3rd year of college.The Companys which offer Internships along with Pre Placement Offers has internship drives throughout 3rd year to the beginning of 4th year. The Companies which came to our College for Internship Drives are:- Optum, Dell, Reliance Jio, Coviam, and Maya Data for 3rd-year students. For 4th-year students, high range companies like VM Ware, Autodesk, Nutanix, and Informatica visited our campus to date.One can also try for off-campus internships in 3rd as well as 4th year. Companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Goldman- Sachs conduct off-campus recruitment drives for 3rd year as well as 4th year. Check the Job Sections of these company websites every 2 weeks to check for any updates. Also, check other websites and Linkedin posts for regular updates.Companies offering Pre Placement Offers along with Internships can be of 3 types:-Internships with Confirmed PPO- This is generally offered by companies in 4th year.Internships with Conditional PPO- The PPO will be offered along with the Internship but can be terminated on the basis of performance throughout the term.Internships with Performance-Based PPO- In this case you are selected for the internship and the company will constantly monitor your progress based on your progress. There may be chances of other tests and interviews for the PPO offer.Are internships mandatory for campus placements?No, not at all. Internships are important but not mandatory. The person sitting in front of you will judge you on the basis of your ability to learn, quick thinking, knowledge, and decision-making skills, not just some internships.From when should I start preparing for the Internship? Some tips and ResourcesCoding Basics and DSA should be clear by the end of 3rd sem.Coding in competitive coding platforms like Hackerrank, HackerEarth, Code Chef, and Leet Code should be started by the 4th sem.Practice whatever code comes on your way this will increase your flexibility on problem-solving ability, instead of being confined to coding platforms.Open Source Platforms like Medium, Geeks for Geeks are very helpful for clearing concepts.Clear the fundamental concepts of the core subjects. Subjects like Computer Networking, Operating System, DSA, DBMS, and Applications of DAA are very important for placement as well as an internship recruitment perspective.Choose a Domain, clear concepts from that domain, and try to make 1‚Äì2 projects on it.Start preparing for a company by checking the role offered. Geeks for Geeks has an extensive collection of people sharing their experiences for every company and profile.Regular Aptitude practice either from a book or from Open Sources like www.indiabix.com, https://www.careerride.com/. Also, try practicing from books like R.S Agarwal and Fast Track Mathematics by Arihant. The key to ace in Aptitude in speed and practice, so I would suggest giving a mixed bag test of aptitude at least once in a month.CGPA matters. Not extensively but it does matter. For a student in a private college, one should try and maintain a CGPA above 8.5.Soft Skills are important. Good speaking skills are an added advantage during an interview.Websites like Javatpointand GeeksforGeeks have an extensive collection of interview preparation questions, try using those.11. The Internet is your friend most of the questions and queries are already there you only need proper keywords to ask.12. Most of the time, the interviews for internships as well as placements have the level of difficulty the only difference will be the syllabus if you are in 3rd year vs if you are in 4th year.13. Every word you write in your resume should be set on your brain, and be prepared to be questioned on it. If you are not confident about a project or a topic skip writing it.What to expect from an industrial internship?An industrial internship can be of either of the following types:-A training program in which interns will be given the opportunity to learn new evolving technology.To work on an industrial project. The new technologies are to be learned while creating projects.Tips for getting PPO in a performance-based Internship.First of all, yes an intern has to shed lots of blood sweat, and tears to get a PPO. There can be two ways of evaluating interns from my two internship experiences:-On the basis of constant monitoring and checking of your progress. This happens in the case of industrial project-based internships. In this case, you have to report to your senior after each deadline.The second is as in the case of Training based internships, formal tests and interviews are taken to access your knowledge.Getting PPO is tough as you have to compete with students from not only your college but with people throughout our country. But, if you take the internship seriously and complete all the tasks in time with proper explanations and knowledge you will be converted as a full-timer.If I don‚Äôt get a Pre Placement Offer from my Internship?Though it will be devastating for you, it is not the end of the world. You can still opt for Campus Placements if they are still ongoing. Otherwise, try for off-campus placements. Yes, it will be challenging but it is a risk worth taking. The knowledge and experience that you have gained from the Internship will give you an edge over other students.Lastly, Believe in yourself.Dream big. Set goals. Work Hard.Never ever give up in life.

"Preparation Strategy for service-based companies like TCS, CTS, Infosys, Wipro.",https://medium.com/@mgmanogna55/preparation-strategy-for-service-based-companies-like-tcs-infosys-cts-84b5ebb2af4f?source=tag_archive---------8-----------------------,"Placement,Preparation,Interview Preparation,Interview,Tips","Photo by sydney Rae on UnsplashThis article is based on how I prepared for service-based companies in the final year of my engineering and cracked their selection process. Many of you are thinking that it is difficult to crack the interview process if you are from a three-tier college because of the current situation due to which very few companies are hiring. So, here is the guide for you for preparing and cracking these service-based companies.Firstly, all the service-based companies mostly have a common pattern of selection pattern i.eAptitude roundCoding roundTechnical InterviewHR InterviewHow to Prepare for Aptitude Round?Aptitude Round being the first round for many companies selection process, is generally conducted to filter a few candidates out of a large number appearing the selection process. To crack the Aptitude round, I recommend using the practice questions from the following apps/websites.IndiaBix(available on play store)- quantitative aptitude, logical reasoning questions from this app can be directly seen in the first round mostly.You can also refer to TestPrep, Unacademy for understanding concepts.PrepInsta(https://prepinsta.com/)-this website consists of the various company based questions and can help one understand the difficulty of the questions.Hitbullseye(https://www.hitbullseye.com/)-this website can be used for the preparation of verbal aptitude as various topics are explained clearly and easily.Companies like TCS repeat previous year question types. So it is better to prepare TCS previous year questions available in various apps like TCS Placement Papers, TCS NQT Papers, etc.Companies like Wipro, CTS conduct their first round on the AMCAT platform where there is a section called AUTOMATA FIX. In this section, the candidate needs to fix the logical/syntax error in the given code by reusing the existing functions. For this, you need to prepare some beginner-level coding questions available on GeeksforGeeks, Hackerank, etc.Some companies have a writing section where you‚Äôll be asked to write 200‚Äì300 words for a given situation. You have to write at least 200 words without grammatical mistakes related to the situation.Companies conducting the exam on the CO-CUBES platform consist of QA,VA, logical and coding rounds. The coding round consist of 3 questions out of which you need to solve at least 2 which will be easy in order to get a good score.One needs to solve the maximum number of these questions given in the first round to get qualified for the next round. So, if you find any difficult question it is advised to leave that question and move to other questions as all questions have equal marks.Mostly, the questions from the following chapters may appear:Permutation and CombinationsData Interpretation and SufficiencyProfit and LossRatios and ProportionsTime, Speed and DistanceTime and WorkClocks and CalendarsSyllogismVerbal Aptitude:Fill in the blanksSynonyms/AntonymsError Detection/CorrectionPassage/Sentence RearrangementThese are some topics that are generally given in the aptitude section. You can refer to RS Agarwaal/Arun Sharma books for Aptitude and Reasoning.2.Coding Round:The coding round for Service-based companies consists of coding questions that are not too difficult to solve. You can solve them by practicing an ample amount of questions on Hackerank or GeeksForGeeks. You need to solve questions with difficulty level easy and medium to cross this round.It is advised to solve the questions in C/C++/Java based on your convenience. Get a grip on at least one object-orientated programming language.Sevice based companies rarely ask difficult programming question which involves the usage of data structures and algorithms.TCS CODE VITA is another way of recruiting into TCS. One needs to solve at least 2 and maximum 3/4 questions to qualify this round. One needs to have good knowledge of data structure and algorithm to solve some questions in CODE VITA.For the coding round prepare:(go through GeeksforGeeks for preparing the following topics)ArraysStringsBit MagicSearching and SortingMatricesRecursionProblems using structures3.Technical Interview:Getting selected for a company demands a good performance in the Interviews. You need to prepare various topics likeThe languages you mentioned in the Resume-The Interviewer read your resume and asks you about the basics of the languages you mentioned in your resume, differences between them, etc. For example: why python is called scripting language? , Differences between C and C++.Questions from the projects you have mentioned in your resume. For example, what is the use of the project? what are the project goals? what is the architecture of your project? what are the different functionalities of your project? , What changes you implemented in your project to overcome the difficulties existing in the present system?, SQL queries that you have implemented to extract the data, etc.Questions from your favorite subject in BTECH or questions from DBMS, CN, OS. Basic questions from these subjects will be asked. So it is advised to read at least one of these subjects in order to answer the questions asked.Questions from HTML, PHP, CSS, JS may also be asked if you have mentioned them in the resume.Some puzzles may also be asked to test your aptitude skills again. For puzzles (http://quiz.geeksforgeeks.org/category/articles/puzzle/)check out the link.Some times the Interviewer may ask you to write the code on the white paper. So, practice some questions writing on the paper. If you don't know the exact code for the question, at least write the pseudocode in case you forgot the syntax or try to generate the logic by assuming the test cases.I advise you to mention the topics you are confident about and don't mention any subjects or languages you don't know in your resume. It is absolutely OKAY to have one or two languages you know than mentioning many topics you don't know in your resume.4.HR Interview:For the HR round, you must have good knowledge of the company. So go through the company website to get some knowledge about the company like vision and mission of the company, what are its achievements in the last two years, etc.Questions likeWhy do you want to work for this company?Tell me about yourself?Why we should hire you?What are your strengths and weakness?What are your hobbies?Where do you see yourself in the next five years?Can you work under pressure?Can you relocate to any location?Can you work in the night shift?Who is your inspiration and why?These are some questions you should basically prepare and for more such questions surf the internet. I advise you to not answer these questions in one line. Justify your answers with valid reasons. Prepare for these questions by writing the answers before you attend an interview so that you have a specific answer in your mind. This makes you look confident and you need not recollect your answers. There may be some questions for which you need to answer spontaneously but be confident in answering them.I have collected some material regarding aptitude and coding for cracking service-based companies.

Shourya Jaiswal: Placed At Citrix,https://medium.com/ieee-manipal/shourya-jaiswal-placed-at-citrix-f1bf0c3a5fd8?source=tag_archive---------9-----------------------,"Placement,Citrix,Software Development,Jobs,Ieee","We, at IEEESBM (IEEE, Student Branch Manipal) , talked to Shourya Jaiswal, IEEESBM‚Äôs alumnus, who was placed at Citrix via the on-campus placement procedure in 2019. As a part of IEEESBM, he led the team as General Secretary and was also an Alexa Campus Ambassador. We wanted to learn about his interview experience and get some insights on the whole process!He answered a few of the common questions that we asked!All my answers are applicable only for SDE roles.1.On what basis should we select which companies to apply for?The main factors for me are (in decreasing order of priority): Role offered, growth opportunities, work culture, compensation offered and the financial status of the company.2.What is the ideal time to start interview-based preparation?Apart from building a good CV, you need to be thorough with the CS fundamentals and be decently good at solving DS & Algorithm coding questions. CS fundamentals can be done while it is being taught in the college courses. For coding you need to practise a lot and that takes the majority of your time while preparing. I believe it can be done in a year if you want to do it at a comfortable pace. Otherwise if you‚Äôre ready to dedicate your entire time to it then at least 3 months should be required.3.Where to find the most appropriate and concise resources from?Resources I used:To start coding: geeksforgeeks.comAfter a month of coding: leetcode.comAptitude: indiabix.comDS & Algorithm fundamentals: Abdul Bari‚Äôs channel on youtubeOS and DBMS fundamentals: Knowledge Gate channel on youtubeA list of some important questions I recently came across:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SM92efk8oDl8nyVw8NHPnbGexTS9W-1gmTEYfEurLWQ/edit4. How to divide time between course and preparation?CS fundamentals can be covered while they are being taught in the course itself. If you understand it clearly once, revising it before the placements would hardly take a few days. Coding practice can be done during the semester but I personally didn‚Äôt get the motivation to do it then. So I used to do that only during my vacations. But it is advisable to continue the practise during the semesters.5. What are Citrix interview rounds? Is there a specific type of questions asked? What was the selection criteria?The OT consisted of 2 coding questions and some general CS MCQs. For interviews I had 3 rounds but some people had 4 as well. The first round was on OOP, networking and database systems. The second round consisted of 4 coding questions, all having a difficulty level of leetcode medium. The third round was taken by an engineering manager who asked me OS and HR questions.6. How should one maintain a positive temperament during the entire placement season?I believe placements depend on your luck as well and it is not entirely based on your skill. So believe in your skills. If you know your stuff well and if you have decent communication skills, you will get placed.7. A tip that you would have given yourself a year back regarding placements.Start preparing for coding interviews early. It takes more time than estimated.8. What are the must know topics as far as Citrix interview is concerned?It isn‚Äôt much different from other similar companies. Data Structures, Algorithms, Operating Systems, Computer Networks, Database Systems and Object Oriented Programming are the must know topics for the interviews.9. From a technical perspective, what are the must haves in a CV?Frankly, I don‚Äôt think there are any such must haves for campus placements. You can get selected even with 2‚Äì3 pet projects on your CV. But it is nice to have at least one technical internship experience and 1 or 2 complex projects to talk about in the interviews. Try to get the projects deployed and put a link to it in your CV so that the interviewer can test it out easily.10. Any other advice you‚Äôd like to mention.Hiring process of startups generally differs from that of MNCs. A lot of startups tend to focus more on hiring based on your knowledge of some particular technology that they have a requirement for. Whereas MNCs are mostly interested in your fundamentals of CS and they won‚Äôt reject you if you don‚Äôt know a particular tech-stack. But to be on a safe side, while building projects try to use a tech-stack which is currently relevant to the market and is widely used.We sure found this session quite insightful, hope you found this article helpful too!IEEE ManipalLargest Professional Technical Organization.Follow117 PlacementCitrixSoftware DevelopmentJobsIeee117¬†claps117¬†clapsWritten byAasthagroverFollowFollowIEEE ManipalFollowA blog about all things technical brought to you by IEEE Manipal, a technical club of Manipal Institute of Technology.FollowWritten byAasthagroverFollowIEEE ManipalFollowA blog about all things technical brought to you by IEEE Manipal, a technical club of Manipal Institute of Technology.More From MediumThe gloves are off: One man‚Äôs fight to stop sales team extinctionMichael in The StartupHow to Turn Workplace Criticism to Your AdvantageBrooke Harrison in The Post-Grad Survival GuideSexism in Tech: An Inconvenient TruthRob Doyle in The Startup‚ÄòAmazon Moms‚Äô Are Every Working Mom, Calling for Backup Day-Care BenefitsWashington Post in The Washington PostHow To Find a Business MentorJerry FordHow to Build a Disruptive Organization: Part 1 (of 3): The Disruptive Mindset DemystifiedJames Brett - Evolving Digital Leadership in The StartupHere‚Äôs why your colleagues don‚Äôt respond to your e-mails the way you wantedClaire Wang in The StartupThe Disappointing Flip Side of Being an OverachieverMelody Wilding, LMSW in The Post-Grad Survival GuideLearn more.Medium is an open platform where 170 million readers come to find insightful and dynamic thinking."
