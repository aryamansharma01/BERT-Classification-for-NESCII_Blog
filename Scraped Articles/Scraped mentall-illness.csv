My story of OCPD: how I subconsciously stopped myself from living my best life,https://medium.com/@ivana.musich/my-story-of-ocpd-how-i-subconsciously-stopped-myself-from-living-my-best-life-9f961034e303?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Mentall Illness,Mental Health,Self,Self Improvement,Ocd","Mental illness, or whatever I thought that meant, did not apply to me. I did not suffer from one, nor have I been diagnosed with one. This all changed when a friend, who happens to be a life coach, challenged me to read more about mental disorders. One disorder in particular resonated very closely with my life.What is mental illness anyway? It can be defined as a pattern that causes distress or impairment of personal functioning, affecting how a person behaves, feels, perceives, or thinks. When we think of mental illness we may think of extreme cases where it is preventing a person from living their day to day life. The notion of ‘functioning’ is subjective. Even if you haven’t been diagnosed with a mental disorder, what if there was something lingering in the background, affecting your life in ways that are not as subtle as you think?I immersed myself in research and discovered Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder or OCPD. Health professionals describe it as “a personality disorder characterized by excessive concern with orderliness, perfectionism, attention to details, mental and interpersonal control, and a need for control over one’s environment, which interferes with flexibility, openness to experience.” Developed as a coping mechanism unconsciously in childhood, I now realize it is actually preventing me from manifesting the life I want to live as an adult.My research uncovered that people who have OCPD likely grew up with over-involved and overprotective parents who expected their strict rules to be followed. Disobedience to those rules was followed by punishment and grounding. These children, as a result, learned that in order to survive at home they needed to be perfect. They received praise for ‘being good’. Experts say that this can be labeled as learned behaviour, or in other words, a coping mechanism. Children start to believe that they need to follow the rules and be a good girl/boy, because if they don’t, they would disrupt everything in their environment, and therefore, it was their responsibility to ‘keep it together’.What a tall order.What I ‘learned’ is that I must do everything in my power to keep the order, to prevent the adults from freaking out, to prevent being grounded. As an adult, this developed a belief that, if I go toward what I desire (or break cultural rules), I will be punished. How do I avoid this so-called punishment? I try to control everything — things that are in my control and things that are not. (The illusion is that I think I can control everything). I’ve become accustomed to thinking that everything needs to be a certain way in order for me to feel safe and good about myself. There is a complete lack of trust in life and the unknown. There is very little room for risk-taking.Therefore I feel like I can conclude that for me personally, not manifesting my desires is my subconscious attempt at survival. I always thought I was living my best life, but when I reflect back on what living has looked like for me, it was merely survival, since I was too afraid to go after what I truly desired, in fear of punishment.How does such a person go in the direction of their dreams? How does someone manifest that which they want for themselves? They don’t. It doesn’t feel safe. It is better to manifest that which others approve of, leading to manifesting what is accepted culturally or socially, or even literally manifesting for others (making sure others are okay first, attending to their needs before your own).A perfectionist in the makingFor example, I have realized with my OCPD that I need to feel accomplished. As such, it is rare for me to take a day off and not check something off my list. I would consider that a waste of a day. I was so obsessed with efficiency that I would schedule activities weeks in advance, my calendar would be so detailed and planned out, there was no possibility to deviate from it. If everything is to be done from a place of accomplishment and the need to check off boxes, it would make sense that my life revolves around work. One way I centered my life around work was by living close to the office so that my commute would be short, so that I could maximize my day, so that I would have time after work to go to more places faster. Do you see the control? The thought of getting a dog was so overwhelming because it would throw a wrench in my calendar. The thought of jeopardizing my efficiency would send me into a panic. I would feel completely trapped by this mental narrative.OCPD has a positive side (there are two sides to any coin). It can make you productive, motivated, and efficient (a trait that’s extremely valuable at work). Individuals with OCPD are detail-oriented, take initiative, are reliable, loyal, and responsible. They think of the worst-case scenario all the time and then plan for it. It can make them an invaluable asset to a business and their boss.So, the point here is not to try to eliminate the OCPD or pretend it is not there. The alternative is to first understand where it comes from, and then to embrace where it can add value to my life, instead of letting it control me. Big difference. So instead of eliminating something that will likely never go away, I want to be able to pinpoint how it has had a negative effect on my life; how it has created a story and an illusion that I’m living and thriving, when I’m really not. The idea is to challenge the story created by OCPD in order to extend trust in life, the universe, whatever you want to call it. Stepping out of the confines of my made-up schedule and need to control outcomes can actually lead to better, unimaginable outcomes. With OCPD, you only know what you know, and you don’t even try to know what you don’t know. That is not a life well-lived.How do I catch myself now? When I start to spiral I ask myself a number of questions, such as:Am I controlling the outcome here?How am I being inflexible and what is it I am trying to protect myself from?Am I rescuing someone else? Why?Am I impressing someone else, or seeking to be validated?Am I making up chaos (story) in my head?These days I am trying to challenge my OCPD and the story it has created by consciously throwing a wrench in my schedule. And trying to move further away from downtown to escape that ‘go go go’ mentality. My OCPD will always be there, but with this newfound awareness, I want to consciously direct it in ways where it will be useful, and challenge it when it is not.Have you ever tried to identify what could be a mental health issue for you?

Mental Illness and Abuse. How Living Through It Can Make You Stronger,https://medium.com/@joannharris-53598/mental-illness-and-abuse-how-living-through-it-can-make-you-stronger-279ad060776c?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Addiction,Mentall Illness,Abuse,Emotional Abuse,Money","If you live or have lived with someone who had/has mental illness resulting in abuse to you I have a few insights from the pain I endured at the time that was happening to me.Somehow I always knew it would not last forever. I knew at some point it would be over one way or another. It took many years to accomplish this but it did end.His was acting wild, erratic, hyper-emotional, unstable, abusive, which resulted in being more of an alcoholic than I had ever scene. He would say he was going out for smokes and never return. The first time he did this it put me in panic mode. I called everyone of his friends to see if he was with them. Then it all bounced back on me as I asked myself if I had done something to cause this as I had never had such a thing happen to me before. We had only known each other a year or so and it never came up.He would finally come back the next day without any explanation. I asked him about what happened trying to get some understanding, but he didn’t feel he needed to explain. “Don’t bust my balls about it!” I left him alone.MENTAL ILLNESSIt all started for me about four to six years or so before my twin boys were born in another country. They are now twenty-five and doing well. Their Dad committed suicide from having schizo-effective disorder and being on so many psychiatric drugs so he could function. He felt that as well.In the end he fell and didn’t get treatment immediately. He was obnoxious, angry, and wouldn’t let anyone help him. He went to a doctor but lied about all the medications he was on. The doctor prescribed Morphine for his pain.DEATHThis was a grave mistake because my husband had an addictive nature. He also had been a drug addict in his early life, so he ultimately took an overdose on purpose. His boys were eleven.It is really a difficult to impossible feat to tell your children that their Dad killed himself.That was a very unusual day. We were divorced at the time and he was living with his brother. Their cousin was helping them move into an apartment a few days earlier. I got a call at work from the cousin just panicked to find her cousin, my ex, dead in bed. She had gone over to check on him and to bring more belongings.She kept asking, “What do I do?, What do I do?” I just told her to call the police to report it and I would be over presently.I assumed he felt he was wasting his life, so why not. It would be better for himself and everyone involved. He just gave up. He had nothing to live for in the state the drugs put him in and he could not live without them. He was supposed to go to psychotherapy but never wanted to do that.By the time I got there the police were there along with the Medical Examiner taking note of the scene. They found him dead and had fallen asleep with a cigarette hanging over an ashtray burned to the nub which was how he went to sleep. He smoked like a chimney. An addiction he had since he was a teen among other things. The Medical Examiner saw all the vials of drugs that he had been prescribed and just shook her head.His brother and cousin were in the living room really upset and crying, etc. His brother saying, “If I had only . . . .” I told him not to do that as his brother didn’t want any help and couldn’t let anyone do anything for him. He was stubborn like that.I did not cry. I was relieved of this burden in my life. I felt free, finally.After a bit he was wheeled out. They put up a sheet so no one could see him in his final state. I did not cry. I was relieved of this burden in my life. I felt free, finally.PAINI went back to work to check on things so I could leave for the day. I had to tell my children what happened.One of them had called the office complaining of being sick to his stomach. I went to the school and picked him up but left the other to finish out his day. No reason really to bring this to his attention before I was ready.I told the son that I had picked up from school what had happened that day after we got home. He was very upset and cried and I held him. He said he felt better after that. Then he went to take a nap.I waited for the other son to come home from school on the bus and then told him what happened. He was in the middle of gaming, sniffed a minute and went on playing. I thought that was not good but I thought it was better to wait for him to ask any questions then to cause more pain.They both knew how their Dad was being through multiple psychotic episodes that just resulted in him going to the VA to get his medications adjusted and staying for a few weeks until he calmed down. He had also scared them a few times and I was afraid he would eventually hurt them.A week or so later we had a small service with only a few people showing up. He had previously ostracized himself from his family, cousins, aunts, uncles, etc. because of his bad behavior that they had to endure most of their whole life. His Mom and Dad had passed away prior to this.The children released balloons and said goodbye. His brother and cousin took care of the burial. We didn’t go to the funeral either. I was too damned angry at him and I didn’t want the boys to have to go through whatever all that would have come to.LESSONS LEARNEDGod, Life, the Universe puts you here on Earth to teach you lessons so you can get more out of life.The StageEighteen years of marriage.Mental instability.Psychotic episodes.AngerAbuse — financially, mentally, emotionally and threats of physical violence.HomelessnessMove to another country out of group agreement.Twin boysMissing in Florida.Alcohol and drugsPrescription psychotic drugsIsolationYou can read more about this here.The Narcissist and the LadyKeep It All A Secretmedium.comWhat I have learned so far:Mental Strength — I learned to rely on myself and to find stability in my life by getting sanity back.For years I did not want to think for myself. I wanted him to think for me and create our life. For a long time he acted as if he could. When many setbacks occurred he went into a deep depression and started sleeping all day, every day.When that started I did not have the mental cohesiveness to cope and organize. I also did not have the financial independence to make our life better in the down times.My Voice — I learned to have a voice.I was always shy and afraid of everything. I was always second guessing myself and being very introverted. I was a very quiet person. I still am but in a different way. I found that if I didn’t speak up for what I wanted I would never get out, ever get it, and things would never get better.Wisdom — I learned a lot about a lot of things.I am glad that I was forty-four when I had the twins. He threatened to harm them more than once inside and outside the womb.If I had been younger I don’t think I could have cared for them and kept them safe as I was a follower instead of a leader. I was also extremely self-centered. You can’t be any of that when you have babies or baby.I also learned that if someone tells you who they are believe them. This was mentioned by Maya Angelo, the wisest person and the most beautiful teacher of the world. Very sad she is gone now but her books and sayings will live forever.I didn’t believe him when he told me he used to be a drug dealer, carried a gun, and spent 28 months in prison. I just didn’t believe him. It was too much for my poor, sheltered, inexperienced mind to comprehend. I know better now.Do Not Isolate Yourself — Stay connected to your family, friends, church members, communities. You can’t do anything all by yourself. Others can help and usually are willing.When we moved to Costa Rica and he said I did not need to know the language to live there, I believed him. That was wrong, just wrong.Costa Rica is a Spanish speaking country. My husband lived in Italy as a child so he was familiar with the Italian language and Spanish are similar.It would have been smart of me to have learned some Spanish before going there. I was willing but he shut me off to everyone. When we moved there people would come over and drink or party and I was left alone in another room or looked at funny. As if I was odd. I was also the one to furnish and clean up after these visitors both American and Costa Rican. No one was interested in me or how I felt about anything. He totally ridiculed me to others behind my back.We did not have a phone to call the USA. We did not have a television to enjoy some entertainment. I had no friends or if I did he ran them off with his destructive actions. He would be so obnoxious and angry when he drank that they did not want to come around again.It was like living in a bubble. You heard sounds but no meaning. This went on for a year. Remember Charlie Brown when adults talked, it was “wha, wha, wha, wha.” Same with me because I did not know Spanish.I also felt emotionally frozen, mentally flat, and alone.When I got pregnant I did find a doctor who spoke English. He was very kind and I liked him a lot but he never thought I was having twins. He was a General Practitioner/Family doctor. He was not the one that did the sonogram where we only saw one baby. But still I was bigger than a mother having one child should be. He should have thought differently or referred me to someone else.We all went out to eat a few times but my husband always took over the conversation and monopolized our fun. He drank and became obnoxious and disrespectful to a lot of people. I think the doctor didn’t like him either. The doctor also never came to the birth or to the hospital later. That’s probably why.Money — Don’t abuse it.We suffered a lot over those years. He worked for himself so sometimes there was a lot of money, sometimes there wasn’t. I worked as office support most of the time which is okay pay but not enough when there is an emergency. Even when you can’t pay bills or buy food that’s stressful.I did not have much earning power then and sometimes he would just not work. He slept a lot. I suppose he always suffered from depression and I did not know it. I thought it was just being lazy.I could not make my own decisions about money either until after he was gone. That was a huge freedom I had. I knew how to budget, pay bills, etc. but I did not know how to deal with no money and you still had to pay bills and such. It was extremely stressful.Abusive behavior when money is concerned is just wrong. He was an alcoholic and would go to bars and burn $100 dollar bills while people watched. Money we could have used for whatever. What made him act like that? Hard to say.Now I have earning power, and was the breadwinner for a long time. Retirement has put a stick in that but I still am the one that pays the bills and buys the food. I can make my own decisions where money is concerned as well.Other thoughtsI still have some issues when it comes to people, trust, love, other people’s motivations, etc. I suppose therapy could help.I am in a relationship now after twelve years with no one. I just don’t want anything to go badly. We have the freedom to be each other. No one tries to change the other. We just root for each other. We help each other and enjoy each other’s company. We care for each other and we are respectful to each other. It’s going on three years and I hope it lasts for awhile.That was what was missing a long time ago.Respect! It is very important.FinallyOne take-away from this would be to never give in to loneliness, isolation, defeat, ridicule, stress, anxiety or to threats.Keep in your mind that it will be over one day and you will have your freedom again. You will come out stronger as well.Jo Ann Harris is an author, parent, book devotee, writer, copywriter, and film fanatic. She is an autodidact who learns about everything and rows her own boat.

Mental Health Series,https://medium.com/@elizpellokila/mental-health-series-1034748a5c8a?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"Desperate,Mentall Illness,Mental Health,Depression,Mental Health Awareness","Chapter 1: DesperateHaving lost all hope.Feeling, showing, or involving a hopeless sense that a situation is so bad as to be impossible to deal with.Don’t you realize that everything that looks okay is not always “okay”? There are a lot of people who struggles and suffers in so many problems in their life.I’ve been in this situation lately. The world always seems against you. You lose all your hope, trust, and feel like a failure. I think that I’m a complete failure and worthless.Desperate is different from depression. Nevertheless, desperate can cause depression. A lot of things can cause depression or then will end up with mental illness. And there is also a lot of stuff that strong desperate up.In particular, like my friend’s said. Failure is relative. And so desperate — or, in this case, losing hope. The crash that I’ve been experiencing lately really drives me to depression. It isn’t straightforward when you lose your faith and give up on everything that you’ve manifested for it.Why do people get so desperate?A lot of people desperate because they can’t get what they’ve planned, frantic because they can’t revenge with a thing that will make their enemies mum, desperately seeking validation, or desperate because they were left by their loved one and so many more.Desperate is not only a condition when you want to hurt yourself or either kill yourself. It can also make someone want to harm others to express their hurts.How to deal with it?Like I’ve stated, desperate is different from depression. When you’re depressed, you lack energy, and thus you’re fatigued, resulting in some physical ailments like digestive problems, body ache, loss of appetite, etc. Like you feel you can’t do something because you know you’ll fail.But when you’re desperate, you’re loaded with energy to accomplish the task or get the work done. Also, you’re prepared to go to any extent by taking all sorts of risks — which what I’ve done recently. I still have so much ambition in myself self, but the world is not on my side, so I failed, and I’m losing my hope. Yet, when I fall, it will hit me so hard because it seems I’ve drained so much energy and time to achieve what I want.The best way to cope with desperate is to break for a while. Break, but don’t stop. You are just facing the bitterness of life, so you have to reflects what the world or God wants you to be.I needed somewhere to cry and not feel so alone, been going through a lot for a long time. I think for all of you, and I’m so sorry we’re all going through these feelings. It’s okay. For the right thoughts are not always your thoughts, neither are your ways my waysThe thing is, those of us who are drowning and cope with depression because of desperate might not realize it. Feel like a failure is okay. But, don’t forget to recover and stand up better. Those of us who are unspeakably ill might not even know that such an illness exists. Always mark in your mind that some mental illness isn’t something to be ashamed of.It’s okay to be sad. It’s okay to feel blue. I’m here to listen to all your miseries.Written byEliz PellokilaShe loves random and bizarre things.

N/A,https://medium.com/@Molly8/decompensation-e883858d1d06?source=tag_archive---------5-----------------------,"Prison Reform,Mentall Illness,Corrections,Frontline","Decompensation:How The Asylums of Last Resort are Failing Our Most Vulnerable PopulationsMolly HuffColorado Mesa UniversityDecompensation, by Todd (Hyung-Rae) Tarselli, a mentally ill prisoner in a super-maximum Pennsylvania facilityThe SummaryEssentially, this documentary was a representative example of the mental health crisis in America today; while Ohio and its correctional system specifically was the focus of the film, these scenarios and stories could have been from any prison — any state — in our country. The film estimated that there are approximately ten times as many mentally ill individuals incarcerated in America as there are mentally ill people in mental health treatment facilities and environments, a statistic that is backed up by the Torrey et. al. statewide study conducted in 2014 in Virginia; our textbook cites various studies that claim a range from less than a quarter to almost half of all US inmates “had a mental health problem” (Erickson & Erickson, 2008). Whatever the true number, it would seem that a system already overcapacity is also under the added and considerable burden of housing and dealing with the majority of the nation’s mentally ill.Because prisons and jails are not designed, staffed, or organized with mental health or treatment in mind, the hundreds of thousands of individuals with mental illnesses who find themselves incarcerated every year face an almost inevitable path of infractions, segregation, longer sentences, and the total collapse of any coping skills they may have had up until that point, also known as decompensation. Essentially, because “the prison does not exist to provide mental health treatment,” but rather to provide “safety and security to the community,” behavior that is symptomatic of the individual’s mental illness will inevitably be seen as disciplinary misconduct and treated accordingly by a staff that is prepped to quell violence and disruption harshly and unanimously (Navasky & O’Connor, 2005). To be specific, the disruptive behavior that is often a direct result of their mental illness and anguish results in extended stays in segregation and near-constant visits from extraction teams, the SWAT teams of the incarceration world who wear riot gear and bum-rush these individuals into brute submission. A life spent largely in solitary confinement with only delusions and psychotic episodes for company, punctuated by the occasional extraction visit, all but ensures that, as pointed out by the film, those who enter incarceration mentally ill invariably get worse and those who enter mentally normative invariably become to some degree mentally ill. Indeed, a federal judge stated in the opinion written after Madrid v. Gomez that placing these vulnerable inmates into solitary confinement “is the mental equivalent of putting an asthmatic in a place with little air to breathe” (Haney, 2017).Cause of the IssueDeinstitutionalization is inarguably the root cause of our prisons and jails becoming the de facto mental health solution of the United States. One thing that is crucial to understanding many themes and trends within the criminal justice history of the United States is the historical tendency for our policies and practices to swing from one end of the pendulum (the crime-control model, in which public safety is the number one priority) to the other (due process, wherein concern for the constitutional rights of individuals brought before the state take precedence). Indeed, it was the accepted practice to house the mentally ill in jails and prisons for the beginning of our nation’s history — just as we do today — until the nineteenth century, when the switch was made to the state-run hospitals and asylums that quickly became overrun and understaffed. In turn, this became the norm until the aforementioned deinstitutionalization of the mid-twentieth century (Torrey et. al., 2016). While many people would perhaps be quick to assume that the mass closure and downsizing of most state mental hospitals in America was the result of callous financial and political games, it was actually an empathetic and compassionate (if not short-sighted) response to what had become atrocious conditions and overcrowding, leaving the country’s most vulnerable in deplorable conditions. The well-intentioned idea was that the warehousing of mentally ill people in these asylums would be replaced by intimate and personalized community treatment, wherein society would take care of their own from the bottom up. While this is the ideal solution, the doors of state mental hospitals were closed en masse with very little of the necessary community infrastructure in place or even the ability to do so. The results were predictable, in hindsight: an exodus of people with very little social support or coping skills to the streets and underpasses of America.Simultaneously, the pendulum of the American criminal justice system has been swinging inexorably back towards the crime-control model ever since the civil rights era, meaning that the socially unacceptable or even frightening or bewildering behavior displayed by a mentally ill and homeless person going about their day began to be routinely greeted with arrest and incarceration. Haney speaks to the “decontextualization of criminality, which has greatly expanded the reach of the criminal justice system and removed consideration of social factors…from the sentencing calculus”; the routine arrest of people who are at worst in a state of psychosis is the culmination of this trend.Whereas the index crimes for the vast majority of the incarcerated mentally ill in America are nonviolent and extremely minor, upon incarceration their behavior is naturally exacerbated and worsened by the environment itself, which has marked effects on even the correctional officers and administrative staff who get to leave at the end of the workday. The fear and violence of the prison environment is almost entirely antithetical to the one in which mentally ill individuals should be. One inmate filmed for the documentary perfectly illustrated the results of what Haney termed an “ecology of cruelty”: Carl McEachron, sent to prison for a crime that carried with it a maximum sentence of 3 years, had spent 16 years in prison at the time of filming due to infractions and violations directly related to his mental illness (Haney, 2017; Navasky & O’Connor, 2005).Solutions to the IssueWhile a feasible solution may appear too daunting to consider, there is a welcome and encouraging consensus in the literature regarding how to begin to mediate this public health crisis. For example, almost all professionals even tangentially involved in this problem agree that “individuals with severe mental disorders who are in need of treatment belong in hospitals, not in prisons and jails” (Torrey et. al., 2016). The mass implementation of Crisis Intervention Training across law enforcement agencies, as well as their partnership with Acute Trauma Units and advocacy services, could prevent thousands of arrests and recidivisms every year. Keeping these people in the community and on top of their medication management and well-being makes good fiscal as well as moral sense, not to mention the public safety component. As the director of Ohio’s corrections stated in the documentary, he became not only a prison warden but a mental health director when he accepted the job; no aspect of our current correctional system is prepared for or geared towards this type of massive social responsibility.My Thoughts/Opinions on the FilmI was extremely struck by the footage that this documentary showed from the archives of the prisons themselves: watching mentally disturbed and possibly psychotic inmates get tactically and brutally subdued by men in masks and riot gear and dragged out of the tiny cells in which they spend their entire lives gave me a chilling sense of perspective into the type of horrifying reality these individuals live in when they are left in a cell without adequate treatment or medication. Our textbook decried the asylums and hospitals that prisons replaced, where “hoods were placed on patients’ heads in an effort to quiet their minds” (Erickson & Erickson, 2008). This film did an excellent job of showing just how far contemporary prisons have gone in their efforts to fill their predecessor’s shoes.CitationsErickson, P. E., & Erickson, S. K. (2008).

Recognizing Emerging Mental Illness,https://medium.com/@kartardiamond/recognizing-emerging-mental-illness-e6effce5cab7?source=tag_archive---------6-----------------------,"Mentall Illness,Misdiagnosis,Self Medicating,Drug Use","Photo by MaximoRecognizing mental illness when it first emerges can be extremely difficult, even for family members who are so familiar with the personality and character of their suffering loved one. This can be an agonizing and fear-inducing predicament for obvious reasons. What makes the recognition of mental illness so challenging can be blamed on several factors.Firstly, the average person is not expected to be educated about mental illness, unless they already have someone in their life with a well-established mental illness. Some cultures make people extraordinarily uncomfortable with even speculating that a family member could be ill and they procrastinate in seeking out professional help or even discussing it privately. Because there is a lot of stigma associated with mental illnesses, both the sufferer and their family may want to assume anything else could be going on besides a diagnosis which can alter a person’s life forever and profoundly.When mental illness first manifests, if the person experiencing it is young, like a teenager, their odd behaviors and symptoms could be hastily written off as the result of teenage hormones. Young males especially can engage in risky, aggressive, or manic behaviors that are misinterpreted precisely because of their youth and immaturity.Because of the prevalence of drug abuse in our society, it’s also a common reflexive response for family members to think that their ill child or sibling may be acting strange and unpredictable because they are under the influence of drugs or alcohol. In fact, even when we suspect that a person may have psychological issues, we still consider the possibility that their most disturbing symptoms could be caused by self-medicating with drugs. During one of my own son’s longer hospitalizations, I was stunned to find out he was not under the influence of street drugs when he committed some very anti-social behaviors.Another reason why it is so hard to recognize emerging mental illness is because some people are actually fairly good at hiding it for a while, intentionally or not. Parents are often told to notice if their child suddenly withdraws from their friends, starts doing poorly in school, or seems to have a sudden personality shift. These are important clues, but some kids or young adults can still pretend they are doing fine when they are not, until something really dramatic or explosive happens, taking everyone by surprise.We also need to separate out what may be defined clinically as a personality disorder or a mood disorder, compared with full-blown serious mental illness. For example, anxiety can be very concerning and debilitating. Some behaviors associated with anxiety can even reveal and underlying psychotic process. But there is a world of difference between general anxiety disorder and schizophrenia.There are clinical descriptions of what constitutes a mental illness, but some of those behaviors and symptoms need to occur continuously over at least a six month period of time before it can be confirmed. It is also very common for diagnoses to change as more and different symptoms emerge. Psychiatrists do their best to be accurate, but they do not have any type of physical examination to determine a mental disorder. In fact, sometimes they can only come to conclusions based on what the mentally ill person admits to them. When a person with a thought disorder relays their own symptoms, their perceptions and memories could be far from accurate or objective. Further, it is also common for people to have a co-occurring diagnosis. For example, a person may have both anxiety and depression. A person diagnosed with both schizophrenia and a mood disorder is referred to as schizoaffective disorder. The term “dual diagnosis” now implies a mental illness along with a substance abuse disorder.Some medications address targeted issues, but with a misdiagnosis the side effects can be substantial. For instance, if a person initially acts depressed, they may be prescribed an anti-depressant. If the person actually has bipolar disorder, the anti-depressant could propel the person into a manic episode. Most of us have heard the commercials on TV with the long list of scary side-effects from medications. The wrong prescription could increase a person’s symptoms or cause completely different ones, including suicidal ideation.Roughly 20% of the general population will experience some form of psychological stress at points in their life which is significant enough to warrant professional help. Being depressed over genuinely stressful life events like divorce or job loss will eventually subside when circumstances improve and when temporary therapy or other treatments are utilized. Serious mental illness, however, needs to be managed for a life time, often with unsatisfactory results.One thing for sure is that the more we openly discuss mental illness, the less stigmatized it will become. In turn, more people will seek out treatment sooner and compliance to medication or therapy will also be more successful.Written byKartar DiamondFeng Shui consultant, author & teacher since 1992. www.FengShuiSolutions.net I also write about other metaphysical topics and mental health advocacy.Follow1 1 1 Mentall IllnessMisdiagnosisSelf MedicatingDrug UseMore from Kartar DiamondFollowFeng Shui consultant, author & teacher since 1992. www.FengShuiSolutions.net I also write about other metaphysical topics and mental health advocacy.More From MediumWhy Disconnecting Made Me Feel More ConnectedEvan McCoy in Invisible IllnessWhen Everyone Thinks You’re Overreacting, But You’re NotRuss W in Invisible IllnessThe Underestimated Ways Depression Can Enrich Your LifeCarine Ru in Invisible IllnessDoes My Inflamed Brain Make Me Suicidal?Toni Tails in SURVIVORSHow Pottery Helped Me Overcome My AnxietyDaniel A in The AscentWhat It’s Like to Know You’ll Be on Antidepressants for LifeDanielle Tcholakian in The Cut10 Quotes to Help You Find Hope During the Coronavirus PandemicCynthia Perkins, M.Ed. in Invisible IllnessAnxiety: How My First Bully Became My Oldest FriendCharlotte Buelow in The AscentAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

My story of OCPD: how I subconsciously stopped myself from living my best life,https://medium.com/@ivana.musich/my-story-of-ocpd-how-i-subconsciously-stopped-myself-from-living-my-best-life-9f961034e303?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Mentall Illness,Mental Health,Self,Self Improvement,Ocd","Mental illness, or whatever I thought that meant, did not apply to me. I did not suffer from one, nor have I been diagnosed with one. This all changed when a friend, who happens to be a life coach, challenged me to read more about mental disorders. One disorder in particular resonated very closely with my life.What is mental illness anyway? It can be defined as a pattern that causes distress or impairment of personal functioning, affecting how a person behaves, feels, perceives, or thinks. When we think of mental illness we may think of extreme cases where it is preventing a person from living their day to day life. The notion of ‘functioning’ is subjective. Even if you haven’t been diagnosed with a mental disorder, what if there was something lingering in the background, affecting your life in ways that are not as subtle as you think?I immersed myself in research and discovered Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder or OCPD. Health professionals describe it as “a personality disorder characterized by excessive concern with orderliness, perfectionism, attention to details, mental and interpersonal control, and a need for control over one’s environment, which interferes with flexibility, openness to experience.” Developed as a coping mechanism unconsciously in childhood, I now realize it is actually preventing me from manifesting the life I want to live as an adult.My research uncovered that people who have OCPD likely grew up with over-involved and overprotective parents who expected their strict rules to be followed. Disobedience to those rules was followed by punishment and grounding. These children, as a result, learned that in order to survive at home they needed to be perfect. They received praise for ‘being good’. Experts say that this can be labeled as learned behaviour, or in other words, a coping mechanism. Children start to believe that they need to follow the rules and be a good girl/boy, because if they don’t, they would disrupt everything in their environment, and therefore, it was their responsibility to ‘keep it together’.What a tall order.What I ‘learned’ is that I must do everything in my power to keep the order, to prevent the adults from freaking out, to prevent being grounded. As an adult, this developed a belief that, if I go toward what I desire (or break cultural rules), I will be punished. How do I avoid this so-called punishment? I try to control everything — things that are in my control and things that are not. (The illusion is that I think I can control everything). I’ve become accustomed to thinking that everything needs to be a certain way in order for me to feel safe and good about myself. There is a complete lack of trust in life and the unknown. There is very little room for risk-taking.Therefore I feel like I can conclude that for me personally, not manifesting my desires is my subconscious attempt at survival. I always thought I was living my best life, but when I reflect back on what living has looked like for me, it was merely survival, since I was too afraid to go after what I truly desired, in fear of punishment.How does such a person go in the direction of their dreams? How does someone manifest that which they want for themselves? They don’t. It doesn’t feel safe. It is better to manifest that which others approve of, leading to manifesting what is accepted culturally or socially, or even literally manifesting for others (making sure others are okay first, attending to their needs before your own).A perfectionist in the makingFor example, I have realized with my OCPD that I need to feel accomplished. As such, it is rare for me to take a day off and not check something off my list. I would consider that a waste of a day. I was so obsessed with efficiency that I would schedule activities weeks in advance, my calendar would be so detailed and planned out, there was no possibility to deviate from it. If everything is to be done from a place of accomplishment and the need to check off boxes, it would make sense that my life revolves around work. One way I centered my life around work was by living close to the office so that my commute would be short, so that I could maximize my day, so that I would have time after work to go to more places faster. Do you see the control? The thought of getting a dog was so overwhelming because it would throw a wrench in my calendar. The thought of jeopardizing my efficiency would send me into a panic. I would feel completely trapped by this mental narrative.OCPD has a positive side (there are two sides to any coin). It can make you productive, motivated, and efficient (a trait that’s extremely valuable at work). Individuals with OCPD are detail-oriented, take initiative, are reliable, loyal, and responsible. They think of the worst-case scenario all the time and then plan for it. It can make them an invaluable asset to a business and their boss.So, the point here is not to try to eliminate the OCPD or pretend it is not there. The alternative is to first understand where it comes from, and then to embrace where it can add value to my life, instead of letting it control me. Big difference. So instead of eliminating something that will likely never go away, I want to be able to pinpoint how it has had a negative effect on my life; how it has created a story and an illusion that I’m living and thriving, when I’m really not. The idea is to challenge the story created by OCPD in order to extend trust in life, the universe, whatever you want to call it. Stepping out of the confines of my made-up schedule and need to control outcomes can actually lead to better, unimaginable outcomes. With OCPD, you only know what you know, and you don’t even try to know what you don’t know. That is not a life well-lived.How do I catch myself now? When I start to spiral I ask myself a number of questions, such as:Am I controlling the outcome here?How am I being inflexible and what is it I am trying to protect myself from?Am I rescuing someone else? Why?Am I impressing someone else, or seeking to be validated?Am I making up chaos (story) in my head?These days I am trying to challenge my OCPD and the story it has created by consciously throwing a wrench in my schedule. And trying to move further away from downtown to escape that ‘go go go’ mentality. My OCPD will always be there, but with this newfound awareness, I want to consciously direct it in ways where it will be useful, and challenge it when it is not.Have you ever tried to identify what could be a mental health issue for you?

Mental Illness and Abuse. How Living Through It Can Make You Stronger,https://medium.com/@joannharris-53598/mental-illness-and-abuse-how-living-through-it-can-make-you-stronger-279ad060776c?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Addiction,Mentall Illness,Abuse,Emotional Abuse,Money","If you live or have lived with someone who had/has mental illness resulting in abuse to you I have a few insights from the pain I endured at the time that was happening to me.Somehow I always knew it would not last forever. I knew at some point it would be over one way or another. It took many years to accomplish this but it did end.His was acting wild, erratic, hyper-emotional, unstable, abusive, which resulted in being more of an alcoholic than I had ever scene. He would say he was going out for smokes and never return. The first time he did this it put me in panic mode. I called everyone of his friends to see if he was with them. Then it all bounced back on me as I asked myself if I had done something to cause this as I had never had such a thing happen to me before. We had only known each other a year or so and it never came up.He would finally come back the next day without any explanation. I asked him about what happened trying to get some understanding, but he didn’t feel he needed to explain. “Don’t bust my balls about it!” I left him alone.MENTAL ILLNESSIt all started for me about four to six years or so before my twin boys were born in another country. They are now twenty-five and doing well. Their Dad committed suicide from having schizo-effective disorder and being on so many psychiatric drugs so he could function. He felt that as well.In the end he fell and didn’t get treatment immediately. He was obnoxious, angry, and wouldn’t let anyone help him. He went to a doctor but lied about all the medications he was on. The doctor prescribed Morphine for his pain.DEATHThis was a grave mistake because my husband had an addictive nature. He also had been a drug addict in his early life, so he ultimately took an overdose on purpose. His boys were eleven.It is really a difficult to impossible feat to tell your children that their Dad killed himself.That was a very unusual day. We were divorced at the time and he was living with his brother. Their cousin was helping them move into an apartment a few days earlier. I got a call at work from the cousin just panicked to find her cousin, my ex, dead in bed. She had gone over to check on him and to bring more belongings.She kept asking, “What do I do?, What do I do?” I just told her to call the police to report it and I would be over presently.I assumed he felt he was wasting his life, so why not. It would be better for himself and everyone involved. He just gave up. He had nothing to live for in the state the drugs put him in and he could not live without them. He was supposed to go to psychotherapy but never wanted to do that.By the time I got there the police were there along with the Medical Examiner taking note of the scene. They found him dead and had fallen asleep with a cigarette hanging over an ashtray burned to the nub which was how he went to sleep. He smoked like a chimney. An addiction he had since he was a teen among other things. The Medical Examiner saw all the vials of drugs that he had been prescribed and just shook her head.His brother and cousin were in the living room really upset and crying, etc. His brother saying, “If I had only . . . .” I told him not to do that as his brother didn’t want any help and couldn’t let anyone do anything for him. He was stubborn like that.I did not cry. I was relieved of this burden in my life. I felt free, finally.After a bit he was wheeled out. They put up a sheet so no one could see him in his final state. I did not cry. I was relieved of this burden in my life. I felt free, finally.PAINI went back to work to check on things so I could leave for the day. I had to tell my children what happened.One of them had called the office complaining of being sick to his stomach. I went to the school and picked him up but left the other to finish out his day. No reason really to bring this to his attention before I was ready.I told the son that I had picked up from school what had happened that day after we got home. He was very upset and cried and I held him. He said he felt better after that. Then he went to take a nap.I waited for the other son to come home from school on the bus and then told him what happened. He was in the middle of gaming, sniffed a minute and went on playing. I thought that was not good but I thought it was better to wait for him to ask any questions then to cause more pain.They both knew how their Dad was being through multiple psychotic episodes that just resulted in him going to the VA to get his medications adjusted and staying for a few weeks until he calmed down. He had also scared them a few times and I was afraid he would eventually hurt them.A week or so later we had a small service with only a few people showing up. He had previously ostracized himself from his family, cousins, aunts, uncles, etc. because of his bad behavior that they had to endure most of their whole life. His Mom and Dad had passed away prior to this.The children released balloons and said goodbye. His brother and cousin took care of the burial. We didn’t go to the funeral either. I was too damned angry at him and I didn’t want the boys to have to go through whatever all that would have come to.LESSONS LEARNEDGod, Life, the Universe puts you here on Earth to teach you lessons so you can get more out of life.The StageEighteen years of marriage.Mental instability.Psychotic episodes.AngerAbuse — financially, mentally, emotionally and threats of physical violence.HomelessnessMove to another country out of group agreement.Twin boysMissing in Florida.Alcohol and drugsPrescription psychotic drugsIsolationYou can read more about this here.The Narcissist and the LadyKeep It All A Secretmedium.comWhat I have learned so far:Mental Strength — I learned to rely on myself and to find stability in my life by getting sanity back.For years I did not want to think for myself. I wanted him to think for me and create our life. For a long time he acted as if he could. When many setbacks occurred he went into a deep depression and started sleeping all day, every day.When that started I did not have the mental cohesiveness to cope and organize. I also did not have the financial independence to make our life better in the down times.My Voice — I learned to have a voice.I was always shy and afraid of everything. I was always second guessing myself and being very introverted. I was a very quiet person. I still am but in a different way. I found that if I didn’t speak up for what I wanted I would never get out, ever get it, and things would never get better.Wisdom — I learned a lot about a lot of things.I am glad that I was forty-four when I had the twins. He threatened to harm them more than once inside and outside the womb.If I had been younger I don’t think I could have cared for them and kept them safe as I was a follower instead of a leader. I was also extremely self-centered. You can’t be any of that when you have babies or baby.I also learned that if someone tells you who they are believe them. This was mentioned by Maya Angelo, the wisest person and the most beautiful teacher of the world. Very sad she is gone now but her books and sayings will live forever.I didn’t believe him when he told me he used to be a drug dealer, carried a gun, and spent 28 months in prison. I just didn’t believe him. It was too much for my poor, sheltered, inexperienced mind to comprehend. I know better now.Do Not Isolate Yourself — Stay connected to your family, friends, church members, communities. You can’t do anything all by yourself. Others can help and usually are willing.When we moved to Costa Rica and he said I did not need to know the language to live there, I believed him. That was wrong, just wrong.Costa Rica is a Spanish speaking country. My husband lived in Italy as a child so he was familiar with the Italian language and Spanish are similar.It would have been smart of me to have learned some Spanish before going there. I was willing but he shut me off to everyone. When we moved there people would come over and drink or party and I was left alone in another room or looked at funny. As if I was odd. I was also the one to furnish and clean up after these visitors both American and Costa Rican. No one was interested in me or how I felt about anything. He totally ridiculed me to others behind my back.We did not have a phone to call the USA. We did not have a television to enjoy some entertainment. I had no friends or if I did he ran them off with his destructive actions. He would be so obnoxious and angry when he drank that they did not want to come around again.It was like living in a bubble. You heard sounds but no meaning. This went on for a year. Remember Charlie Brown when adults talked, it was “wha, wha, wha, wha.” Same with me because I did not know Spanish.I also felt emotionally frozen, mentally flat, and alone.When I got pregnant I did find a doctor who spoke English. He was very kind and I liked him a lot but he never thought I was having twins. He was a General Practitioner/Family doctor. He was not the one that did the sonogram where we only saw one baby. But still I was bigger than a mother having one child should be. He should have thought differently or referred me to someone else.We all went out to eat a few times but my husband always took over the conversation and monopolized our fun. He drank and became obnoxious and disrespectful to a lot of people. I think the doctor didn’t like him either. The doctor also never came to the birth or to the hospital later. That’s probably why.Money — Don’t abuse it.We suffered a lot over those years. He worked for himself so sometimes there was a lot of money, sometimes there wasn’t. I worked as office support most of the time which is okay pay but not enough when there is an emergency. Even when you can’t pay bills or buy food that’s stressful.I did not have much earning power then and sometimes he would just not work. He slept a lot. I suppose he always suffered from depression and I did not know it. I thought it was just being lazy.I could not make my own decisions about money either until after he was gone. That was a huge freedom I had. I knew how to budget, pay bills, etc. but I did not know how to deal with no money and you still had to pay bills and such. It was extremely stressful.Abusive behavior when money is concerned is just wrong. He was an alcoholic and would go to bars and burn $100 dollar bills while people watched. Money we could have used for whatever. What made him act like that? Hard to say.Now I have earning power, and was the breadwinner for a long time. Retirement has put a stick in that but I still am the one that pays the bills and buys the food. I can make my own decisions where money is concerned as well.Other thoughtsI still have some issues when it comes to people, trust, love, other people’s motivations, etc. I suppose therapy could help.I am in a relationship now after twelve years with no one. I just don’t want anything to go badly. We have the freedom to be each other. No one tries to change the other. We just root for each other. We help each other and enjoy each other’s company. We care for each other and we are respectful to each other. It’s going on three years and I hope it lasts for awhile.That was what was missing a long time ago.Respect! It is very important.FinallyOne take-away from this would be to never give in to loneliness, isolation, defeat, ridicule, stress, anxiety or to threats.Keep in your mind that it will be over one day and you will have your freedom again. You will come out stronger as well.Jo Ann Harris is an author, parent, book devotee, writer, copywriter, and film fanatic. She is an autodidact who learns about everything and rows her own boat.

You lose all your hope, trust, and feel like a failure. I think that I’m a complete failure and worthless.Desperate is different from depression. Nevertheless, desperate can cause depression. A lot of things can cause depression or then will end up with mental illness. And there is also a lot of stuff that strong desperate up.In particular, like my friend’s said. Failure is relative. And so desperate — or, in this case, losing hope. The crash that I’ve been experiencing lately really drives me to depression. It isn’t straightforward when you lose your faith and give up on everything that you’ve manifested for it.Why do people get so desperate?A lot of people desperate because they can’t get what they’ve planned, frantic because they can’t revenge with a thing that will make their enemies mum, desperately seeking validation, or desperate because they were left by their loved one and so many more.Desperate is not only a condition when you want to hurt yourself or either kill yourself. It can also make someone want to harm others to express their hurts.How to deal with it?Like I’ve stated, desperate is different from depression. When you’re depressed, you lack energy, and thus you’re fatigued, resulting in some physical ailments like digestive problems, body ache, loss of appetite, etc. Like you feel you can’t do something because you know you’ll fail.But when you’re desperate, you’re loaded with energy to accomplish the task or get the work done. Also, you’re prepared to go to any extent by taking all sorts of risks — which what I’ve done recently. I still have so much ambition in myself self, but the world is not on my side, so I failed, and I’m losing my hope. Yet, when I fall, it will hit me so hard because it seems I’ve drained so much energy and time to achieve what I want.The best way to cope with desperate is to break for a while. Break, but don’t stop. You are just facing the bitterness of life, so you have to reflects what the world or God wants you to be.I needed somewhere to cry and not feel so alone, been going through a lot for a long time. I think for all of you, and I’m so sorry we’re all going through these feelings. It’s okay. For the right thoughts are not always your thoughts, neither are your ways my waysThe thing is, those of us who are drowning and cope with depression because of desperate might not realize it. Feel like a failure is okay. But, don’t forget to recover and stand up better. Those of us who are unspeakably ill might not even know that such an illness exists. Always mark in your mind that some mental illness isn’t something to be ashamed of.It’s okay to be sad. It’s okay to feel blue. I’m here to listen to all your miseries.Written byEliz PellokilaShe loves random and bizarre things.

N/A,https://medium.com/@Molly8/decompensation-e883858d1d06?source=tag_archive---------5-----------------------,"Prison Reform,Mentall Illness,Corrections,Frontline","Decompensation:How The Asylums of Last Resort are Failing Our Most Vulnerable PopulationsMolly HuffColorado Mesa UniversityDecompensation, by Todd (Hyung-Rae) Tarselli, a mentally ill prisoner in a super-maximum Pennsylvania facilityThe SummaryEssentially, this documentary was a representative example of the mental health crisis in America today; while Ohio and its correctional system specifically was the focus of the film, these scenarios and stories could have been from any prison — any state — in our country. The film estimated that there are approximately ten times as many mentally ill individuals incarcerated in America as there are mentally ill people in mental health treatment facilities and environments, a statistic that is backed up by the Torrey et. al. statewide study conducted in 2014 in Virginia; our textbook cites various studies that claim a range from less than a quarter to almost half of all US inmates “had a mental health problem” (Erickson & Erickson, 2008). Whatever the true number, it would seem that a system already overcapacity is also under the added and considerable burden of housing and dealing with the majority of the nation’s mentally ill.Because prisons and jails are not designed, staffed, or organized with mental health or treatment in mind, the hundreds of thousands of individuals with mental illnesses who find themselves incarcerated every year face an almost inevitable path of infractions, segregation, longer sentences, and the total collapse of any coping skills they may have had up until that point, also known as decompensation. Essentially, because “the prison does not exist to provide mental health treatment,” but rather to provide “safety and security to the community,” behavior that is symptomatic of the individual’s mental illness will inevitably be seen as disciplinary misconduct and treated accordingly by a staff that is prepped to quell violence and disruption harshly and unanimously (Navasky & O’Connor, 2005). To be specific, the disruptive behavior that is often a direct result of their mental illness and anguish results in extended stays in segregation and near-constant visits from extraction teams, the SWAT teams of the incarceration world who wear riot gear and bum-rush these individuals into brute submission. A life spent largely in solitary confinement with only delusions and psychotic episodes for company, punctuated by the occasional extraction visit, all but ensures that, as pointed out by the film, those who enter incarceration mentally ill invariably get worse and those who enter mentally normative invariably become to some degree mentally ill. Indeed, a federal judge stated in the opinion written after Madrid v. Gomez that placing these vulnerable inmates into solitary confinement “is the mental equivalent of putting an asthmatic in a place with little air to breathe” (Haney, 2017).Cause of the IssueDeinstitutionalization is inarguably the root cause of our prisons and jails becoming the de facto mental health solution of the United States. One thing that is crucial to understanding many themes and trends within the criminal justice history of the United States is the historical tendency for our policies and practices to swing from one end of the pendulum (the crime-control model, in which public safety is the number one priority) to the other (due process, wherein concern for the constitutional rights of individuals brought before the state take precedence). Indeed, it was the accepted practice to house the mentally ill in jails and prisons for the beginning of our nation’s history — just as we do today — until the nineteenth century, when the switch was made to the state-run hospitals and asylums that quickly became overrun and understaffed. In turn, this became the norm until the aforementioned deinstitutionalization of the mid-twentieth century (Torrey et. al., 2016). While many people would perhaps be quick to assume that the mass closure and downsizing of most state mental hospitals in America was the result of callous financial and political games, it was actually an empathetic and compassionate (if not short-sighted) response to what had become atrocious conditions and overcrowding, leaving the country’s most vulnerable in deplorable conditions. The well-intentioned idea was that the warehousing of mentally ill people in these asylums would be replaced by intimate and personalized community treatment, wherein society would take care of their own from the bottom up. While this is the ideal solution, the doors of state mental hospitals were closed en masse with very little of the necessary community infrastructure in place or even the ability to do so. The results were predictable, in hindsight: an exodus of people with very little social support or coping skills to the streets and underpasses of America.Simultaneously, the pendulum of the American criminal justice system has been swinging inexorably back towards the crime-control model ever since the civil rights era, meaning that the socially unacceptable or even frightening or bewildering behavior displayed by a mentally ill and homeless person going about their day began to be routinely greeted with arrest and incarceration. Haney speaks to the “decontextualization of criminality, which has greatly expanded the reach of the criminal justice system and removed consideration of social factors…from the sentencing calculus”; the routine arrest of people who are at worst in a state of psychosis is the culmination of this trend.Whereas the index crimes for the vast majority of the incarcerated mentally ill in America are nonviolent and extremely minor, upon incarceration their behavior is naturally exacerbated and worsened by the environment itself, which has marked effects on even the correctional officers and administrative staff who get to leave at the end of the workday. The fear and violence of the prison environment is almost entirely antithetical to the one in which mentally ill individuals should be. One inmate filmed for the documentary perfectly illustrated the results of what Haney termed an “ecology of cruelty”: Carl McEachron, sent to prison for a crime that carried with it a maximum sentence of 3 years, had spent 16 years in prison at the time of filming due to infractions and violations directly related to his mental illness (Haney, 2017; Navasky & O’Connor, 2005).Solutions to the IssueWhile a feasible solution may appear too daunting to consider, there is a welcome and encouraging consensus in the literature regarding how to begin to mediate this public health crisis. For example, almost all professionals even tangentially involved in this problem agree that “individuals with severe mental disorders who are in need of treatment belong in hospitals, not in prisons and jails” (Torrey et. al., 2016). The mass implementation of Crisis Intervention Training across law enforcement agencies, as well as their partnership with Acute Trauma Units and advocacy services, could prevent thousands of arrests and recidivisms every year. Keeping these people in the community and on top of their medication management and well-being makes good fiscal as well as moral sense, not to mention the public safety component. As the director of Ohio’s corrections stated in the documentary, he became not only a prison warden but a mental health director when he accepted the job; no aspect of our current correctional system is prepared for or geared towards this type of massive social responsibility.My Thoughts/Opinions on the FilmI was extremely struck by the footage that this documentary showed from the archives of the prisons themselves: watching mentally disturbed and possibly psychotic inmates get tactically and brutally subdued by men in masks and riot gear and dragged out of the tiny cells in which they spend their entire lives gave me a chilling sense of perspective into the type of horrifying reality these individuals live in when they are left in a cell without adequate treatment or medication. Our textbook decried the asylums and hospitals that prisons replaced, where “hoods were placed on patients’ heads in an effort to quiet their minds” (Erickson & Erickson, 2008). This film did an excellent job of showing just how far contemporary prisons have gone in their efforts to fill their predecessor’s shoes.CitationsErickson, P. E., & Erickson, S. K. (2008).

Recognizing Emerging Mental Illness,https://medium.com/@kartardiamond/recognizing-emerging-mental-illness-e6effce5cab7?source=tag_archive---------6-----------------------,"Mentall Illness,Misdiagnosis,Self Medicating,Drug Use","Photo by MaximoRecognizing mental illness when it first emerges can be extremely difficult, even for family members who are so familiar with the personality and character of their suffering loved one. This can be an agonizing and fear-inducing predicament for obvious reasons. What makes the recognition of mental illness so challenging can be blamed on several factors.Firstly, the average person is not expected to be educated about mental illness, unless they already have someone in their life with a well-established mental illness. Some cultures make people extraordinarily uncomfortable with even speculating that a family member could be ill and they procrastinate in seeking out professional help or even discussing it privately. Because there is a lot of stigma associated with mental illnesses, both the sufferer and their family may want to assume anything else could be going on besides a diagnosis which can alter a person’s life forever and profoundly.When mental illness first manifests, if the person experiencing it is young, like a teenager, their odd behaviors and symptoms could be hastily written off as the result of teenage hormones. Young males especially can engage in risky, aggressive, or manic behaviors that are misinterpreted precisely because of their youth and immaturity.Because of the prevalence of drug abuse in our society, it’s also a common reflexive response for family members to think that their ill child or sibling may be acting strange and unpredictable because they are under the influence of drugs or alcohol. In fact, even when we suspect that a person may have psychological issues, we still consider the possibility that their most disturbing symptoms could be caused by self-medicating with drugs. During one of my own son’s longer hospitalizations, I was stunned to find out he was not under the influence of street drugs when he committed some very anti-social behaviors.Another reason why it is so hard to recognize emerging mental illness is because some people are actually fairly good at hiding it for a while, intentionally or not. Parents are often told to notice if their child suddenly withdraws from their friends, starts doing poorly in school, or seems to have a sudden personality shift. These are important clues, but some kids or young adults can still pretend they are doing fine when they are not, until something really dramatic or explosive happens, taking everyone by surprise.We also need to separate out what may be defined clinically as a personality disorder or a mood disorder, compared with full-blown serious mental illness. For example, anxiety can be very concerning and debilitating. Some behaviors associated with anxiety can even reveal and underlying psychotic process. But there is a world of difference between general anxiety disorder and schizophrenia.There are clinical descriptions of what constitutes a mental illness, but some of those behaviors and symptoms need to occur continuously over at least a six month period of time before it can be confirmed. It is also very common for diagnoses to change as more and different symptoms emerge. Psychiatrists do their best to be accurate, but they do not have any type of physical examination to determine a mental disorder. In fact, sometimes they can only come to conclusions based on what the mentally ill person admits to them. When a person with a thought disorder relays their own symptoms, their perceptions and memories could be far from accurate or objective. Further, it is also common for people to have a co-occurring diagnosis. For example, a person may have both anxiety and depression. A person diagnosed with both schizophrenia and a mood disorder is referred to as schizoaffective disorder. The term “dual diagnosis” now implies a mental illness along with a substance abuse disorder.Some medications address targeted issues, but with a misdiagnosis the side effects can be substantial. For instance, if a person initially acts depressed, they may be prescribed an anti-depressant. If the person actually has bipolar disorder, the anti-depressant could propel the person into a manic episode. Most of us have heard the commercials on TV with the long list of scary side-effects from medications. The wrong prescription could increase a person’s symptoms or cause completely different ones, including suicidal ideation.Roughly 20% of the general population will experience some form of psychological stress at points in their life which is significant enough to warrant professional help. Being depressed over genuinely stressful life events like divorce or job loss will eventually subside when circumstances improve and when temporary therapy or other treatments are utilized. Serious mental illness, however, needs to be managed for a life time, often with unsatisfactory results.One thing for sure is that the more we openly discuss mental illness, the less stigmatized it will become. In turn, more people will seek out treatment sooner and compliance to medication or therapy will also be more successful.Written byKartar DiamondFeng Shui consultant, author & teacher since 1992. www.FengShuiSolutions.net I also write about other metaphysical topics and mental health advocacy.Follow1 1 1 Mentall IllnessMisdiagnosisSelf MedicatingDrug UseMore from Kartar DiamondFollowFeng Shui consultant, author & teacher since 1992. www.FengShuiSolutions.net I also write about other metaphysical topics and mental health advocacy.More From MediumWhy Disconnecting Made Me Feel More ConnectedEvan McCoy in Invisible IllnessWhen Everyone Thinks You’re Overreacting, But You’re NotRuss W in Invisible IllnessThe Underestimated Ways Depression Can Enrich Your LifeCarine Ru in Invisible IllnessDoes My Inflamed Brain Make Me Suicidal?Toni Tails in SURVIVORSHow Pottery Helped Me Overcome My AnxietyDaniel A in The AscentWhat It’s Like to Know You’ll Be on Antidepressants for LifeDanielle Tcholakian in The Cut10 Quotes to Help You Find Hope During the Coronavirus PandemicCynthia Perkins, M.Ed. in Invisible IllnessAnxiety: How My First Bully Became My Oldest FriendCharlotte Buelow in The AscentAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

My story of OCPD: how I subconsciously stopped myself from living my best life,https://medium.com/@ivana.musich/my-story-of-ocpd-how-i-subconsciously-stopped-myself-from-living-my-best-life-9f961034e303?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Mentall Illness,Mental Health,Self,Self Improvement,Ocd","Mental illness, or whatever I thought that meant, did not apply to me. I did not suffer from one, nor have I been diagnosed with one. This all changed when a friend, who happens to be a life coach, challenged me to read more about mental disorders. One disorder in particular resonated very closely with my life.What is mental illness anyway? It can be defined as a pattern that causes distress or impairment of personal functioning, affecting how a person behaves, feels, perceives, or thinks. When we think of mental illness we may think of extreme cases where it is preventing a person from living their day to day life. The notion of ‘functioning’ is subjective. Even if you haven’t been diagnosed with a mental disorder, what if there was something lingering in the background, affecting your life in ways that are not as subtle as you think?I immersed myself in research and discovered Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder or OCPD. Health professionals describe it as “a personality disorder characterized by excessive concern with orderliness, perfectionism, attention to details, mental and interpersonal control, and a need for control over one’s environment, which interferes with flexibility, openness to experience.” Developed as a coping mechanism unconsciously in childhood, I now realize it is actually preventing me from manifesting the life I want to live as an adult.My research uncovered that people who have OCPD likely grew up with over-involved and overprotective parents who expected their strict rules to be followed. Disobedience to those rules was followed by punishment and grounding. These children, as a result, learned that in order to survive at home they needed to be perfect. They received praise for ‘being good’. Experts say that this can be labeled as learned behaviour, or in other words, a coping mechanism. Children start to believe that they need to follow the rules and be a good girl/boy, because if they don’t, they would disrupt everything in their environment, and therefore, it was their responsibility to ‘keep it together’.What a tall order.What I ‘learned’ is that I must do everything in my power to keep the order, to prevent the adults from freaking out, to prevent being grounded. As an adult, this developed a belief that, if I go toward what I desire (or break cultural rules), I will be punished. How do I avoid this so-called punishment? I try to control everything — things that are in my control and things that are not. (The illusion is that I think I can control everything). I’ve become accustomed to thinking that everything needs to be a certain way in order for me to feel safe and good about myself. There is a complete lack of trust in life and the unknown. There is very little room for risk-taking.Therefore I feel like I can conclude that for me personally, not manifesting my desires is my subconscious attempt at survival. I always thought I was living my best life, but when I reflect back on what living has looked like for me, it was merely survival, since I was too afraid to go after what I truly desired, in fear of punishment.How does such a person go in the direction of their dreams? How does someone manifest that which they want for themselves? They don’t. It doesn’t feel safe. It is better to manifest that which others approve of, leading to manifesting what is accepted culturally or socially, or even literally manifesting for others (making sure others are okay first, attending to their needs before your own).A perfectionist in the makingFor example, I have realized with my OCPD that I need to feel accomplished. As such, it is rare for me to take a day off and not check something off my list. I would consider that a waste of a day. I was so obsessed with efficiency that I would schedule activities weeks in advance, my calendar would be so detailed and planned out, there was no possibility to deviate from it. If everything is to be done from a place of accomplishment and the need to check off boxes, it would make sense that my life revolves around work. One way I centered my life around work was by living close to the office so that my commute would be short, so that I could maximize my day, so that I would have time after work to go to more places faster. Do you see the control? The thought of getting a dog was so overwhelming because it would throw a wrench in my calendar. The thought of jeopardizing my efficiency would send me into a panic. I would feel completely trapped by this mental narrative.OCPD has a positive side (there are two sides to any coin). It can make you productive, motivated, and efficient (a trait that’s extremely valuable at work). Individuals with OCPD are detail-oriented, take initiative, are reliable, loyal, and responsible. They think of the worst-case scenario all the time and then plan for it. It can make them an invaluable asset to a business and their boss.So, the point here is not to try to eliminate the OCPD or pretend it is not there. The alternative is to first understand where it comes from, and then to embrace where it can add value to my life, instead of letting it control me. Big difference. So instead of eliminating something that will likely never go away, I want to be able to pinpoint how it has had a negative effect on my life; how it has created a story and an illusion that I’m living and thriving, when I’m really not. The idea is to challenge the story created by OCPD in order to extend trust in life, the universe, whatever you want to call it. Stepping out of the confines of my made-up schedule and need to control outcomes can actually lead to better, unimaginable outcomes. With OCPD, you only know what you know, and you don’t even try to know what you don’t know. That is not a life well-lived.How do I catch myself now? When I start to spiral I ask myself a number of questions, such as:Am I controlling the outcome here?How am I being inflexible and what is it I am trying to protect myself from?Am I rescuing someone else? Why?Am I impressing someone else, or seeking to be validated?Am I making up chaos (story) in my head?These days I am trying to challenge my OCPD and the story it has created by consciously throwing a wrench in my schedule. And trying to move further away from downtown to escape that ‘go go go’ mentality. My OCPD will always be there, but with this newfound awareness, I want to consciously direct it in ways where it will be useful, and challenge it when it is not.Have you ever tried to identify what could be a mental health issue for you?

Mental Illness and Abuse. How Living Through It Can Make You Stronger,https://medium.com/@joannharris-53598/mental-illness-and-abuse-how-living-through-it-can-make-you-stronger-279ad060776c?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Addiction,Mentall Illness,Abuse,Emotional Abuse,Money","If you live or have lived with someone who had/has mental illness resulting in abuse to you I have a few insights from the pain I endured at the time that was happening to me.Somehow I always knew it would not last forever. I knew at some point it would be over one way or another. It took many years to accomplish this but it did end.His was acting wild, erratic, hyper-emotional, unstable, abusive, which resulted in being more of an alcoholic than I had ever scene. He would say he was going out for smokes and never return. The first time he did this it put me in panic mode. I called everyone of his friends to see if he was with them. Then it all bounced back on me as I asked myself if I had done something to cause this as I had never had such a thing happen to me before. We had only known each other a year or so and it never came up.He would finally come back the next day without any explanation. I asked him about what happened trying to get some understanding, but he didn’t feel he needed to explain. “Don’t bust my balls about it!” I left him alone.MENTAL ILLNESSIt all started for me about four to six years or so before my twin boys were born in another country. They are now twenty-five and doing well. Their Dad committed suicide from having schizo-effective disorder and being on so many psychiatric drugs so he could function. He felt that as well.In the end he fell and didn’t get treatment immediately. He was obnoxious, angry, and wouldn’t let anyone help him. He went to a doctor but lied about all the medications he was on. The doctor prescribed Morphine for his pain.DEATHThis was a grave mistake because my husband had an addictive nature. He also had been a drug addict in his early life, so he ultimately took an overdose on purpose. His boys were eleven.It is really a difficult to impossible feat to tell your children that their Dad killed himself.That was a very unusual day. We were divorced at the time and he was living with his brother. Their cousin was helping them move into an apartment a few days earlier. I got a call at work from the cousin just panicked to find her cousin, my ex, dead in bed. She had gone over to check on him and to bring more belongings.She kept asking, “What do I do?, What do I do?” I just told her to call the police to report it and I would be over presently.I assumed he felt he was wasting his life, so why not. It would be better for himself and everyone involved. He just gave up. He had nothing to live for in the state the drugs put him in and he could not live without them. He was supposed to go to psychotherapy but never wanted to do that.By the time I got there the police were there along with the Medical Examiner taking note of the scene. They found him dead and had fallen asleep with a cigarette hanging over an ashtray burned to the nub which was how he went to sleep. He smoked like a chimney. An addiction he had since he was a teen among other things. The Medical Examiner saw all the vials of drugs that he had been prescribed and just shook her head.His brother and cousin were in the living room really upset and crying, etc. His brother saying, “If I had only . . . .” I told him not to do that as his brother didn’t want any help and couldn’t let anyone do anything for him. He was stubborn like that.I did not cry. I was relieved of this burden in my life. I felt free, finally.After a bit he was wheeled out. They put up a sheet so no one could see him in his final state. I did not cry. I was relieved of this burden in my life. I felt free, finally.PAINI went back to work to check on things so I could leave for the day. I had to tell my children what happened.One of them had called the office complaining of being sick to his stomach. I went to the school and picked him up but left the other to finish out his day. No reason really to bring this to his attention before I was ready.I told the son that I had picked up from school what had happened that day after we got home. He was very upset and cried and I held him. He said he felt better after that. Then he went to take a nap.I waited for the other son to come home from school on the bus and then told him what happened. He was in the middle of gaming, sniffed a minute and went on playing. I thought that was not good but I thought it was better to wait for him to ask any questions then to cause more pain.They both knew how their Dad was being through multiple psychotic episodes that just resulted in him going to the VA to get his medications adjusted and staying for a few weeks until he calmed down. He had also scared them a few times and I was afraid he would eventually hurt them.A week or so later we had a small service with only a few people showing up. He had previously ostracized himself from his family, cousins, aunts, uncles, etc. because of his bad behavior that they had to endure most of their whole life. His Mom and Dad had passed away prior to this.The children released balloons and said goodbye. His brother and cousin took care of the burial. We didn’t go to the funeral either. I was too damned angry at him and I didn’t want the boys to have to go through whatever all that would have come to.LESSONS LEARNEDGod, Life, the Universe puts you here on Earth to teach you lessons so you can get more out of life.The StageEighteen years of marriage.Mental instability.Psychotic episodes.AngerAbuse — financially, mentally, emotionally and threats of physical violence.HomelessnessMove to another country out of group agreement.Twin boysMissing in Florida.Alcohol and drugsPrescription psychotic drugsIsolationYou can read more about this here.The Narcissist and the LadyKeep It All A Secretmedium.comWhat I have learned so far:Mental Strength — I learned to rely on myself and to find stability in my life by getting sanity back.For years I did not want to think for myself. I wanted him to think for me and create our life. For a long time he acted as if he could. When many setbacks occurred he went into a deep depression and started sleeping all day, every day.When that started I did not have the mental cohesiveness to cope and organize. I also did not have the financial independence to make our life better in the down times.My Voice — I learned to have a voice.I was always shy and afraid of everything. I was always second guessing myself and being very introverted. I was a very quiet person. I still am but in a different way. I found that if I didn’t speak up for what I wanted I would never get out, ever get it, and things would never get better.Wisdom — I learned a lot about a lot of things.I am glad that I was forty-four when I had the twins. He threatened to harm them more than once inside and outside the womb.If I had been younger I don’t think I could have cared for them and kept them safe as I was a follower instead of a leader. I was also extremely self-centered. You can’t be any of that when you have babies or baby.I also learned that if someone tells you who they are believe them. This was mentioned by Maya Angelo, the wisest person and the most beautiful teacher of the world. Very sad she is gone now but her books and sayings will live forever.I didn’t believe him when he told me he used to be a drug dealer, carried a gun, and spent 28 months in prison. I just didn’t believe him. It was too much for my poor, sheltered, inexperienced mind to comprehend. I know better now.Do Not Isolate Yourself — Stay connected to your family, friends, church members, communities. You can’t do anything all by yourself. Others can help and usually are willing.When we moved to Costa Rica and he said I did not need to know the language to live there, I believed him. That was wrong, just wrong.Costa Rica is a Spanish speaking country. My husband lived in Italy as a child so he was familiar with the Italian language and Spanish are similar.It would have been smart of me to have learned some Spanish before going there. I was willing but he shut me off to everyone. When we moved there people would come over and drink or party and I was left alone in another room or looked at funny. As if I was odd. I was also the one to furnish and clean up after these visitors both American and Costa Rican. No one was interested in me or how I felt about anything. He totally ridiculed me to others behind my back.We did not have a phone to call the USA. We did not have a television to enjoy some entertainment. I had no friends or if I did he ran them off with his destructive actions. He would be so obnoxious and angry when he drank that they did not want to come around again.It was like living in a bubble. You heard sounds but no meaning. This went on for a year. Remember Charlie Brown when adults talked, it was “wha, wha, wha, wha.” Same with me because I did not know Spanish.I also felt emotionally frozen, mentally flat, and alone.When I got pregnant I did find a doctor who spoke English. He was very kind and I liked him a lot but he never thought I was having twins. He was a General Practitioner/Family doctor. He was not the one that did the sonogram where we only saw one baby. But still I was bigger than a mother having one child should be. He should have thought differently or referred me to someone else.We all went out to eat a few times but my husband always took over the conversation and monopolized our fun. He drank and became obnoxious and disrespectful to a lot of people. I think the doctor didn’t like him either. The doctor also never came to the birth or to the hospital later. That’s probably why.Money — Don’t abuse it.We suffered a lot over those years. He worked for himself so sometimes there was a lot of money, sometimes there wasn’t. I worked as office support most of the time which is okay pay but not enough when there is an emergency. Even when you can’t pay bills or buy food that’s stressful.I did not have much earning power then and sometimes he would just not work. He slept a lot. I suppose he always suffered from depression and I did not know it. I thought it was just being lazy.I could not make my own decisions about money either until after he was gone. That was a huge freedom I had. I knew how to budget, pay bills, etc. but I did not know how to deal with no money and you still had to pay bills and such. It was extremely stressful.Abusive behavior when money is concerned is just wrong. He was an alcoholic and would go to bars and burn $100 dollar bills while people watched. Money we could have used for whatever. What made him act like that? Hard to say.Now I have earning power, and was the breadwinner for a long time. Retirement has put a stick in that but I still am the one that pays the bills and buys the food. I can make my own decisions where money is concerned as well.Other thoughtsI still have some issues when it comes to people, trust, love, other people’s motivations, etc. I suppose therapy could help.I am in a relationship now after twelve years with no one. I just don’t want anything to go badly. We have the freedom to be each other. No one tries to change the other. We just root for each other. We help each other and enjoy each other’s company. We care for each other and we are respectful to each other. It’s going on three years and I hope it lasts for awhile.That was what was missing a long time ago.Respect! It is very important.FinallyOne take-away from this would be to never give in to loneliness, isolation, defeat, ridicule, stress, anxiety or to threats.Keep in your mind that it will be over one day and you will have your freedom again. You will come out stronger as well.Jo Ann Harris is an author, parent, book devotee, writer, copywriter, and film fanatic. She is an autodidact who learns about everything and rows her own boat.

Mental Health Series,https://medium.com/@elizpellokila/mental-health-series-1034748a5c8a?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"Desperate,Mentall Illness,Mental Health,Depression,Mental Health Awareness","Chapter 1: DesperateHaving lost all hope.Feeling, showing, or involving a hopeless sense that a situation is so bad as to be impossible to deal with.Don’t you realize that everything that looks okay is not always “okay”? There are a lot of people who struggles and suffers in so many problems in their life.I’ve been in this situation lately. The world always seems against you. You lose all your hope, trust, and feel like a failure. I think that I’m a complete failure and worthless.Desperate is different from depression. Nevertheless, desperate can cause depression. A lot of things can cause depression or then will end up with mental illness. And there is also a lot of stuff that strong desperate up.In particular, like my friend’s said. Failure is relative. And so desperate — or, in this case, losing hope. The crash that I’ve been experiencing lately really drives me to depression. It isn’t straightforward when you lose your faith and give up on everything that you’ve manifested for it.Why do people get so desperate?A lot of people desperate because they can’t get what they’ve planned, frantic because they can’t revenge with a thing that will make their enemies mum, desperately seeking validation, or desperate because they were left by their loved one and so many more.Desperate is not only a condition when you want to hurt yourself or either kill yourself. It can also make someone want to harm others to express their hurts.How to deal with it?Like I’ve stated, desperate is different from depression. When you’re depressed, you lack energy, and thus you’re fatigued, resulting in some physical ailments like digestive problems, body ache, loss of appetite, etc. Like you feel you can’t do something because you know you’ll fail.But when you’re desperate, you’re loaded with energy to accomplish the task or get the work done. Also, you’re prepared to go to any extent by taking all sorts of risks — which what I’ve done recently. I still have so much ambition in myself self, but the world is not on my side, so I failed, and I’m losing my hope. Yet, when I fall, it will hit me so hard because it seems I’ve drained so much energy and time to achieve what I want.The best way to cope with desperate is to break for a while. Break, but don’t stop. You are just facing the bitterness of life, so you have to reflects what the world or God wants you to be.I needed somewhere to cry and not feel so alone, been going through a lot for a long time. I think for all of you, and I’m so sorry we’re all going through these feelings. It’s okay. For the right thoughts are not always your thoughts, neither are your ways my waysThe thing is, those of us who are drowning and cope with depression because of desperate might not realize it. Feel like a failure is okay. But, don’t forget to recover and stand up better. Those of us who are unspeakably ill might not even know that such an illness exists. Always mark in your mind that some mental illness isn’t something to be ashamed of.It’s okay to be sad. It’s okay to feel blue. I’m here to listen to all your miseries.Written byEliz PellokilaShe loves random and bizarre things.

N/A,https://medium.com/@Molly8/decompensation-e883858d1d06?source=tag_archive---------5-----------------------,"Prison Reform,Mentall Illness,Corrections,Frontline","Decompensation:How The Asylums of Last Resort are Failing Our Most Vulnerable PopulationsMolly HuffColorado Mesa UniversityDecompensation, by Todd (Hyung-Rae) Tarselli, a mentally ill prisoner in a super-maximum Pennsylvania facilityThe SummaryEssentially, this documentary was a representative example of the mental health crisis in America today; while Ohio and its correctional system specifically was the focus of the film, these scenarios and stories could have been from any prison — any state — in our country. The film estimated that there are approximately ten times as many mentally ill individuals incarcerated in America as there are mentally ill people in mental health treatment facilities and environments, a statistic that is backed up by the Torrey et. al. statewide study conducted in 2014 in Virginia; our textbook cites various studies that claim a range from less than a quarter to almost half of all US inmates “had a mental health problem” (Erickson & Erickson, 2008). Whatever the true number, it would seem that a system already overcapacity is also under the added and considerable burden of housing and dealing with the majority of the nation’s mentally ill.Because prisons and jails are not designed, staffed, or organized with mental health or treatment in mind, the hundreds of thousands of individuals with mental illnesses who find themselves incarcerated every year face an almost inevitable path of infractions, segregation, longer sentences, and the total collapse of any coping skills they may have had up until that point, also known as decompensation. Essentially, because “the prison does not exist to provide mental health treatment,” but rather to provide “safety and security to the community,” behavior that is symptomatic of the individual’s mental illness will inevitably be seen as disciplinary misconduct and treated accordingly by a staff that is prepped to quell violence and disruption harshly and unanimously (Navasky & O’Connor, 2005). To be specific, the disruptive behavior that is often a direct result of their mental illness and anguish results in extended stays in segregation and near-constant visits from extraction teams, the SWAT teams of the incarceration world who wear riot gear and bum-rush these individuals into brute submission. A life spent largely in solitary confinement with only delusions and psychotic episodes for company, punctuated by the occasional extraction visit, all but ensures that, as pointed out by the film, those who enter incarceration mentally ill invariably get worse and those who enter mentally normative invariably become to some degree mentally ill. Indeed, a federal judge stated in the opinion written after Madrid v. Gomez that placing these vulnerable inmates into solitary confinement “is the mental equivalent of putting an asthmatic in a place with little air to breathe” (Haney, 2017).Cause of the IssueDeinstitutionalization is inarguably the root cause of our prisons and jails becoming the de facto mental health solution of the United States. One thing that is crucial to understanding many themes and trends within the criminal justice history of the United States is the historical tendency for our policies and practices to swing from one end of the pendulum (the crime-control model, in which public safety is the number one priority) to the other (due process, wherein concern for the constitutional rights of individuals brought before the state take precedence). Indeed, it was the accepted practice to house the mentally ill in jails and prisons for the beginning of our nation’s history — just as we do today — until the nineteenth century, when the switch was made to the state-run hospitals and asylums that quickly became overrun and understaffed. In turn, this became the norm until the aforementioned deinstitutionalization of the mid-twentieth century (Torrey et. al., 2016). While many people would perhaps be quick to assume that the mass closure and downsizing of most state mental hospitals in America was the result of callous financial and political games, it was actually an empathetic and compassionate (if not short-sighted) response to what had become atrocious conditions and overcrowding, leaving the country’s most vulnerable in deplorable conditions. The well-intentioned idea was that the warehousing of mentally ill people in these asylums would be replaced by intimate and personalized community treatment, wherein society would take care of their own from the bottom up. While this is the ideal solution, the doors of state mental hospitals were closed en masse with very little of the necessary community infrastructure in place or even the ability to do so. The results were predictable, in hindsight: an exodus of people with very little social support or coping skills to the streets and underpasses of America.Simultaneously, the pendulum of the American criminal justice system has been swinging inexorably back towards the crime-control model ever since the civil rights era, meaning that the socially unacceptable or even frightening or bewildering behavior displayed by a mentally ill and homeless person going about their day began to be routinely greeted with arrest and incarceration. Haney speaks to the “decontextualization of criminality, which has greatly expanded the reach of the criminal justice system and removed consideration of social factors…from the sentencing calculus”; the routine arrest of people who are at worst in a state of psychosis is the culmination of this trend.Whereas the index crimes for the vast majority of the incarcerated mentally ill in America are nonviolent and extremely minor, upon incarceration their behavior is naturally exacerbated and worsened by the environment itself, which has marked effects on even the correctional officers and administrative staff who get to leave at the end of the workday. The fear and violence of the prison environment is almost entirely antithetical to the one in which mentally ill individuals should be. One inmate filmed for the documentary perfectly illustrated the results of what Haney termed an “ecology of cruelty”: Carl McEachron, sent to prison for a crime that carried with it a maximum sentence of 3 years, had spent 16 years in prison at the time of filming due to infractions and violations directly related to his mental illness (Haney, 2017; Navasky & O’Connor, 2005).Solutions to the IssueWhile a feasible solution may appear too daunting to consider, there is a welcome and encouraging consensus in the literature regarding how to begin to mediate this public health crisis. For example, almost all professionals even tangentially involved in this problem agree that “individuals with severe mental disorders who are in need of treatment belong in hospitals, not in prisons and jails” (Torrey et. al., 2016). The mass implementation of Crisis Intervention Training across law enforcement agencies, as well as their partnership with Acute Trauma Units and advocacy services, could prevent thousands of arrests and recidivisms every year. Keeping these people in the community and on top of their medication management and well-being makes good fiscal as well as moral sense, not to mention the public safety component. As the director of Ohio’s corrections stated in the documentary, he became not only a prison warden but a mental health director when he accepted the job; no aspect of our current correctional system is prepared for or geared towards this type of massive social responsibility.My Thoughts/Opinions on the FilmI was extremely struck by the footage that this documentary showed from the archives of the prisons themselves: watching mentally disturbed and possibly psychotic inmates get tactically and brutally subdued by men in masks and riot gear and dragged out of the tiny cells in which they spend their entire lives gave me a chilling sense of perspective into the type of horrifying reality these individuals live in when they are left in a cell without adequate treatment or medication. Our textbook decried the asylums and hospitals that prisons replaced, where “hoods were placed on patients’ heads in an effort to quiet their minds” (Erickson & Erickson, 2008). This film did an excellent job of showing just how far contemporary prisons have gone in their efforts to fill their predecessor’s shoes.CitationsErickson, P. E., & Erickson, S. K. (2008).

Recognizing Emerging Mental Illness,https://medium.com/@kartardiamond/recognizing-emerging-mental-illness-e6effce5cab7?source=tag_archive---------6-----------------------,"Mentall Illness,Misdiagnosis,Self Medicating,Drug Use","Photo by MaximoRecognizing mental illness when it first emerges can be extremely difficult, even for family members who are so familiar with the personality and character of their suffering loved one. This can be an agonizing and fear-inducing predicament for obvious reasons. What makes the recognition of mental illness so challenging can be blamed on several factors.Firstly, the average person is not expected to be educated about mental illness, unless they already have someone in their life with a well-established mental illness. Some cultures make people extraordinarily uncomfortable with even speculating that a family member could be ill and they procrastinate in seeking out professional help or even discussing it privately. Because there is a lot of stigma associated with mental illnesses, both the sufferer and their family may want to assume anything else could be going on besides a diagnosis which can alter a person’s life forever and profoundly.When mental illness first manifests, if the person experiencing it is young, like a teenager, their odd behaviors and symptoms could be hastily written off as the result of teenage hormones. Young males especially can engage in risky, aggressive, or manic behaviors that are misinterpreted precisely because of their youth and immaturity.Because of the prevalence of drug abuse in our society, it’s also a common reflexive response for family members to think that their ill child or sibling may be acting strange and unpredictable because they are under the influence of drugs or alcohol. In fact, even when we suspect that a person may have psychological issues, we still consider the possibility that their most disturbing symptoms could be caused by self-medicating with drugs. During one of my own son’s longer hospitalizations, I was stunned to find out he was not under the influence of street drugs when he committed some very anti-social behaviors.Another reason why it is so hard to recognize emerging mental illness is because some people are actually fairly good at hiding it for a while, intentionally or not. Parents are often told to notice if their child suddenly withdraws from their friends, starts doing poorly in school, or seems to have a sudden personality shift. These are important clues, but some kids or young adults can still pretend they are doing fine when they are not, until something really dramatic or explosive happens, taking everyone by surprise.We also need to separate out what may be defined clinically as a personality disorder or a mood disorder, compared with full-blown serious mental illness. For example, anxiety can be very concerning and debilitating. Some behaviors associated with anxiety can even reveal and underlying psychotic process. But there is a world of difference between general anxiety disorder and schizophrenia.There are clinical descriptions of what constitutes a mental illness, but some of those behaviors and symptoms need to occur continuously over at least a six month period of time before it can be confirmed. It is also very common for diagnoses to change as more and different symptoms emerge. Psychiatrists do their best to be accurate, but they do not have any type of physical examination to determine a mental disorder. In fact, sometimes they can only come to conclusions based on what the mentally ill person admits to them. When a person with a thought disorder relays their own symptoms, their perceptions and memories could be far from accurate or objective. Further, it is also common for people to have a co-occurring diagnosis. For example, a person may have both anxiety and depression. A person diagnosed with both schizophrenia and a mood disorder is referred to as schizoaffective disorder. The term “dual diagnosis” now implies a mental illness along with a substance abuse disorder.Some medications address targeted issues, but with a misdiagnosis the side effects can be substantial. For instance, if a person initially acts depressed, they may be prescribed an anti-depressant. If the person actually has bipolar disorder, the anti-depressant could propel the person into a manic episode. Most of us have heard the commercials on TV with the long list of scary side-effects from medications. The wrong prescription could increase a person’s symptoms or cause completely different ones, including suicidal ideation.Roughly 20% of the general population will experience some form of psychological stress at points in their life which is significant enough to warrant professional help. Being depressed over genuinely stressful life events like divorce or job loss will eventually subside when circumstances improve and when temporary therapy or other treatments are utilized. Serious mental illness, however, needs to be managed for a life time, often with unsatisfactory results.One thing for sure is that the more we openly discuss mental illness, the less stigmatized it will become. In turn, more people will seek out treatment sooner and compliance to medication or therapy will also be more successful.Written byKartar DiamondFeng Shui consultant, author & teacher since 1992. www.FengShuiSolutions.net I also write about other metaphysical topics and mental health advocacy.Follow1 1 1 Mentall IllnessMisdiagnosisSelf MedicatingDrug UseMore from Kartar DiamondFollowFeng Shui consultant, author & teacher since 1992. www.FengShuiSolutions.net I also write about other metaphysical topics and mental health advocacy.More From MediumWhy Disconnecting Made Me Feel More ConnectedEvan McCoy in Invisible IllnessWhen Everyone Thinks You’re Overreacting, But You’re NotRuss W in Invisible IllnessThe Underestimated Ways Depression Can Enrich Your LifeCarine Ru in Invisible IllnessDoes My Inflamed Brain Make Me Suicidal?Toni Tails in SURVIVORSHow Pottery Helped Me Overcome My AnxietyDaniel A in The AscentWhat It’s Like to Know You’ll Be on Antidepressants for LifeDanielle Tcholakian in The Cut10 Quotes to Help You Find Hope During the Coronavirus PandemicCynthia Perkins, M.Ed. in Invisible IllnessAnxiety: How My First Bully Became My Oldest FriendCharlotte Buelow in The AscentAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

It can be defined as a pattern that causes distress or impairment of personal functioning, affecting how a person behaves, feels, perceives, or thinks. When we think of mental illness we may think of extreme cases where it is preventing a person from living their day to day life. The notion of ‘functioning’ is subjective. Even if you haven’t been diagnosed with a mental disorder, what if there was something lingering in the background, affecting your life in ways that are not as subtle as you think?I immersed myself in research and discovered Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder or OCPD. Health professionals describe it as “a personality disorder characterized by excessive concern with orderliness, perfectionism, attention to details, mental and interpersonal control, and a need for control over one’s environment, which interferes with flexibility, openness to experience.” Developed as a coping mechanism unconsciously in childhood, I now realize it is actually preventing me from manifesting the life I want to live as an adult.My research uncovered that people who have OCPD likely grew up with over-involved and overprotective parents who expected their strict rules to be followed. Disobedience to those rules was followed by punishment and grounding. These children, as a result, learned that in order to survive at home they needed to be perfect. They received praise for ‘being good’. Experts say that this can be labeled as learned behaviour, or in other words, a coping mechanism. Children start to believe that they need to follow the rules and be a good girl/boy, because if they don’t, they would disrupt everything in their environment, and therefore, it was their responsibility to ‘keep it together’.What a tall order.What I ‘learned’ is that I must do everything in my power to keep the order, to prevent the adults from freaking out, to prevent being grounded. As an adult, this developed a belief that, if I go toward what I desire (or break cultural rules), I will be punished. How do I avoid this so-called punishment? I try to control everything — things that are in my control and things that are not. (The illusion is that I think I can control everything). I’ve become accustomed to thinking that everything needs to be a certain way in order for me to feel safe and good about myself. There is a complete lack of trust in life and the unknown. There is very little room for risk-taking.Therefore I feel like I can conclude that for me personally, not manifesting my desires is my subconscious attempt at survival. I always thought I was living my best life, but when I reflect back on what living has looked like for me, it was merely survival, since I was too afraid to go after what I truly desired, in fear of punishment.How does such a person go in the direction of their dreams? How does someone manifest that which they want for themselves? They don’t. It doesn’t feel safe. It is better to manifest that which others approve of, leading to manifesting what is accepted culturally or socially, or even literally manifesting for others (making sure others are okay first, attending to their needs before your own).A perfectionist in the makingFor example, I have realized with my OCPD that I need to feel accomplished. As such, it is rare for me to take a day off and not check something off my list. I would consider that a waste of a day. I was so obsessed with efficiency that I would schedule activities weeks in advance, my calendar would be so detailed and planned out, there was no possibility to deviate from it. If everything is to be done from a place of accomplishment and the need to check off boxes, it would make sense that my life revolves around work. One way I centered my life around work was by living close to the office so that my commute would be short, so that I could maximize my day, so that I would have time after work to go to more places faster. Do you see the control? The thought of getting a dog was so overwhelming because it would throw a wrench in my calendar. The thought of jeopardizing my efficiency would send me into a panic. I would feel completely trapped by this mental narrative.OCPD has a positive side (there are two sides to any coin). It can make you productive, motivated, and efficient (a trait that’s extremely valuable at work). Individuals with OCPD are detail-oriented, take initiative, are reliable, loyal, and responsible. They think of the worst-case scenario all the time and then plan for it. It can make them an invaluable asset to a business and their boss.So, the point here is not to try to eliminate the OCPD or pretend it is not there. The alternative is to first understand where it comes from, and then to embrace where it can add value to my life, instead of letting it control me. Big difference. So instead of eliminating something that will likely never go away, I want to be able to pinpoint how it has had a negative effect on my life; how it has created a story and an illusion that I’m living and thriving, when I’m really not. The idea is to challenge the story created by OCPD in order to extend trust in life, the universe, whatever you want to call it. Stepping out of the confines of my made-up schedule and need to control outcomes can actually lead to better, unimaginable outcomes. With OCPD, you only know what you know, and you don’t even try to know what you don’t know. That is not a life well-lived.How do I catch myself now? When I start to spiral I ask myself a number of questions, such as:Am I controlling the outcome here?How am I being inflexible and what is it I am trying to protect myself from?Am I rescuing someone else? Why?Am I impressing someone else, or seeking to be validated?Am I making up chaos (story) in my head?These days I am trying to challenge my OCPD and the story it has created by consciously throwing a wrench in my schedule. And trying to move further away from downtown to escape that ‘go go go’ mentality. My OCPD will always be there, but with this newfound awareness, I want to consciously direct it in ways where it will be useful, and challenge it when it is not.Have you ever tried to identify what could be a mental health issue for you?

Mental Illness and Abuse. How Living Through It Can Make You Stronger,https://medium.com/@joannharris-53598/mental-illness-and-abuse-how-living-through-it-can-make-you-stronger-279ad060776c?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Addiction,Mentall Illness,Abuse,Emotional Abuse,Money","If you live or have lived with someone who had/has mental illness resulting in abuse to you I have a few insights from the pain I endured at the time that was happening to me.Somehow I always knew it would not last forever. I knew at some point it would be over one way or another. It took many years to accomplish this but it did end.His was acting wild, erratic, hyper-emotional, unstable, abusive, which resulted in being more of an alcoholic than I had ever scene. He would say he was going out for smokes and never return. The first time he did this it put me in panic mode. I called everyone of his friends to see if he was with them. Then it all bounced back on me as I asked myself if I had done something to cause this as I had never had such a thing happen to me before. We had only known each other a year or so and it never came up.He would finally come back the next day without any explanation. I asked him about what happened trying to get some understanding, but he didn’t feel he needed to explain. “Don’t bust my balls about it!” I left him alone.MENTAL ILLNESSIt all started for me about four to six years or so before my twin boys were born in another country. They are now twenty-five and doing well. Their Dad committed suicide from having schizo-effective disorder and being on so many psychiatric drugs so he could function. He felt that as well.In the end he fell and didn’t get treatment immediately. He was obnoxious, angry, and wouldn’t let anyone help him. He went to a doctor but lied about all the medications he was on. The doctor prescribed Morphine for his pain.DEATHThis was a grave mistake because my husband had an addictive nature. He also had been a drug addict in his early life, so he ultimately took an overdose on purpose. His boys were eleven.It is really a difficult to impossible feat to tell your children that their Dad killed himself.That was a very unusual day. We were divorced at the time and he was living with his brother. Their cousin was helping them move into an apartment a few days earlier. I got a call at work from the cousin just panicked to find her cousin, my ex, dead in bed. She had gone over to check on him and to bring more belongings.She kept asking, “What do I do?, What do I do?” I just told her to call the police to report it and I would be over presently.I assumed he felt he was wasting his life, so why not. It would be better for himself and everyone involved. He just gave up. He had nothing to live for in the state the drugs put him in and he could not live without them. He was supposed to go to psychotherapy but never wanted to do that.By the time I got there the police were there along with the Medical Examiner taking note of the scene. They found him dead and had fallen asleep with a cigarette hanging over an ashtray burned to the nub which was how he went to sleep. He smoked like a chimney. An addiction he had since he was a teen among other things. The Medical Examiner saw all the vials of drugs that he had been prescribed and just shook her head.His brother and cousin were in the living room really upset and crying, etc. His brother saying, “If I had only . . . .” I told him not to do that as his brother didn’t want any help and couldn’t let anyone do anything for him. He was stubborn like that.I did not cry. I was relieved of this burden in my life. I felt free, finally.After a bit he was wheeled out. They put up a sheet so no one could see him in his final state. I did not cry. I was relieved of this burden in my life. I felt free, finally.PAINI went back to work to check on things so I could leave for the day. I had to tell my children what happened.One of them had called the office complaining of being sick to his stomach. I went to the school and picked him up but left the other to finish out his day. No reason really to bring this to his attention before I was ready.I told the son that I had picked up from school what had happened that day after we got home. He was very upset and cried and I held him. He said he felt better after that. Then he went to take a nap.I waited for the other son to come home from school on the bus and then told him what happened. He was in the middle of gaming, sniffed a minute and went on playing. I thought that was not good but I thought it was better to wait for him to ask any questions then to cause more pain.They both knew how their Dad was being through multiple psychotic episodes that just resulted in him going to the VA to get his medications adjusted and staying for a few weeks until he calmed down. He had also scared them a few times and I was afraid he would eventually hurt them.A week or so later we had a small service with only a few people showing up. He had previously ostracized himself from his family, cousins, aunts, uncles, etc. because of his bad behavior that they had to endure most of their whole life. His Mom and Dad had passed away prior to this.The children released balloons and said goodbye. His brother and cousin took care of the burial. We didn’t go to the funeral either. I was too damned angry at him and I didn’t want the boys to have to go through whatever all that would have come to.LESSONS LEARNEDGod, Life, the Universe puts you here on Earth to teach you lessons so you can get more out of life.The StageEighteen years of marriage.Mental instability.Psychotic episodes.AngerAbuse — financially, mentally, emotionally and threats of physical violence.HomelessnessMove to another country out of group agreement.Twin boysMissing in Florida.Alcohol and drugsPrescription psychotic drugsIsolationYou can read more about this here.The Narcissist and the LadyKeep It All A Secretmedium.comWhat I have learned so far:Mental Strength — I learned to rely on myself and to find stability in my life by getting sanity back.For years I did not want to think for myself. I wanted him to think for me and create our life. For a long time he acted as if he could. When many setbacks occurred he went into a deep depression and started sleeping all day, every day.When that started I did not have the mental cohesiveness to cope and organize. I also did not have the financial independence to make our life better in the down times.My Voice — I learned to have a voice.I was always shy and afraid of everything. I was always second guessing myself and being very introverted. I was a very quiet person. I still am but in a different way. I found that if I didn’t speak up for what I wanted I would never get out, ever get it, and things would never get better.Wisdom — I learned a lot about a lot of things.I am glad that I was forty-four when I had the twins. He threatened to harm them more than once inside and outside the womb.If I had been younger I don’t think I could have cared for them and kept them safe as I was a follower instead of a leader. I was also extremely self-centered. You can’t be any of that when you have babies or baby.I also learned that if someone tells you who they are believe them. This was mentioned by Maya Angelo, the wisest person and the most beautiful teacher of the world. Very sad she is gone now but her books and sayings will live forever.I didn’t believe him when he told me he used to be a drug dealer, carried a gun, and spent 28 months in prison. I just didn’t believe him. It was too much for my poor, sheltered, inexperienced mind to comprehend. I know better now.Do Not Isolate Yourself — Stay connected to your family, friends, church members, communities. You can’t do anything all by yourself. Others can help and usually are willing.When we moved to Costa Rica and he said I did not need to know the language to live there, I believed him. That was wrong, just wrong.Costa Rica is a Spanish speaking country. My husband lived in Italy as a child so he was familiar with the Italian language and Spanish are similar.It would have been smart of me to have learned some Spanish before going there. I was willing but he shut me off to everyone. When we moved there people would come over and drink or party and I was left alone in another room or looked at funny. As if I was odd. I was also the one to furnish and clean up after these visitors both American and Costa Rican. No one was interested in me or how I felt about anything. He totally ridiculed me to others behind my back.We did not have a phone to call the USA. We did not have a television to enjoy some entertainment. I had no friends or if I did he ran them off with his destructive actions. He would be so obnoxious and angry when he drank that they did not want to come around again.It was like living in a bubble. You heard sounds but no meaning. This went on for a year. Remember Charlie Brown when adults talked, it was “wha, wha, wha, wha.” Same with me because I did not know Spanish.I also felt emotionally frozen, mentally flat, and alone.When I got pregnant I did find a doctor who spoke English. He was very kind and I liked him a lot but he never thought I was having twins. He was a General Practitioner/Family doctor. He was not the one that did the sonogram where we only saw one baby. But still I was bigger than a mother having one child should be. He should have thought differently or referred me to someone else.We all went out to eat a few times but my husband always took over the conversation and monopolized our fun. He drank and became obnoxious and disrespectful to a lot of people. I think the doctor didn’t like him either. The doctor also never came to the birth or to the hospital later. That’s probably why.Money — Don’t abuse it.We suffered a lot over those years. He worked for himself so sometimes there was a lot of money, sometimes there wasn’t. I worked as office support most of the time which is okay pay but not enough when there is an emergency. Even when you can’t pay bills or buy food that’s stressful.I did not have much earning power then and sometimes he would just not work. He slept a lot. I suppose he always suffered from depression and I did not know it. I thought it was just being lazy.I could not make my own decisions about money either until after he was gone. That was a huge freedom I had. I knew how to budget, pay bills, etc. but I did not know how to deal with no money and you still had to pay bills and such. It was extremely stressful.Abusive behavior when money is concerned is just wrong. He was an alcoholic and would go to bars and burn $100 dollar bills while people watched. Money we could have used for whatever. What made him act like that? Hard to say.Now I have earning power, and was the breadwinner for a long time. Retirement has put a stick in that but I still am the one that pays the bills and buys the food. I can make my own decisions where money is concerned as well.Other thoughtsI still have some issues when it comes to people, trust, love, other people’s motivations, etc. I suppose therapy could help.I am in a relationship now after twelve years with no one. I just don’t want anything to go badly. We have the freedom to be each other. No one tries to change the other. We just root for each other. We help each other and enjoy each other’s company. We care for each other and we are respectful to each other. It’s going on three years and I hope it lasts for awhile.That was what was missing a long time ago.Respect! It is very important.FinallyOne take-away from this would be to never give in to loneliness, isolation, defeat, ridicule, stress, anxiety or to threats.Keep in your mind that it will be over one day and you will have your freedom again. You will come out stronger as well.Jo Ann Harris is an author, parent, book devotee, writer, copywriter, and film fanatic. She is an autodidact who learns about everything and rows her own boat.

Mental Health Series,https://medium.com/@elizpellokila/mental-health-series-1034748a5c8a?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"Desperate,Mentall Illness,Mental Health,Depression,Mental Health Awareness","Chapter 1: DesperateHaving lost all hope.Feeling, showing, or involving a hopeless sense that a situation is so bad as to be impossible to deal with.Don’t you realize that everything that looks okay is not always “okay”? There are a lot of people who struggles and suffers in so many problems in their life.I’ve been in this situation lately. The world always seems against you. You lose all your hope, trust, and feel like a failure. I think that I’m a complete failure and worthless.Desperate is different from depression. Nevertheless, desperate can cause depression. A lot of things can cause depression or then will end up with mental illness. And there is also a lot of stuff that strong desperate up.In particular, like my friend’s said. Failure is relative. And so desperate — or, in this case, losing hope. The crash that I’ve been experiencing lately really drives me to depression. It isn’t straightforward when you lose your faith and give up on everything that you’ve manifested for it.Why do people get so desperate?A lot of people desperate because they can’t get what they’ve planned, frantic because they can’t revenge with a thing that will make their enemies mum, desperately seeking validation, or desperate because they were left by their loved one and so many more.Desperate is not only a condition when you want to hurt yourself or either kill yourself. It can also make someone want to harm others to express their hurts.How to deal with it?Like I’ve stated, desperate is different from depression. When you’re depressed, you lack energy, and thus you’re fatigued, resulting in some physical ailments like digestive problems, body ache, loss of appetite, etc. Like you feel you can’t do something because you know you’ll fail.But when you’re desperate, you’re loaded with energy to accomplish the task or get the work done. Also, you’re prepared to go to any extent by taking all sorts of risks — which what I’ve done recently. I still have so much ambition in myself self, but the world is not on my side, so I failed, and I’m losing my hope. Yet, when I fall, it will hit me so hard because it seems I’ve drained so much energy and time to achieve what I want.The best way to cope with desperate is to break for a while. Break, but don’t stop. You are just facing the bitterness of life, so you have to reflects what the world or God wants you to be.I needed somewhere to cry and not feel so alone, been going through a lot for a long time. I think for all of you, and I’m so sorry we’re all going through these feelings. It’s okay. For the right thoughts are not always your thoughts, neither are your ways my waysThe thing is, those of us who are drowning and cope with depression because of desperate might not realize it. Feel like a failure is okay. But, don’t forget to recover and stand up better. Those of us who are unspeakably ill might not even know that such an illness exists. Always mark in your mind that some mental illness isn’t something to be ashamed of.It’s okay to be sad. It’s okay to feel blue. I’m here to listen to all your miseries.Written byEliz PellokilaShe loves random and bizarre things.

N/A,https://medium.com/@Molly8/decompensation-e883858d1d06?source=tag_archive---------5-----------------------,"Prison Reform,Mentall Illness,Corrections,Frontline","Decompensation:How The Asylums of Last Resort are Failing Our Most Vulnerable PopulationsMolly HuffColorado Mesa UniversityDecompensation, by Todd (Hyung-Rae) Tarselli, a mentally ill prisoner in a super-maximum Pennsylvania facilityThe SummaryEssentially, this documentary was a representative example of the mental health crisis in America today; while Ohio and its correctional system specifically was the focus of the film, these scenarios and stories could have been from any prison — any state — in our country. The film estimated that there are approximately ten times as many mentally ill individuals incarcerated in America as there are mentally ill people in mental health treatment facilities and environments, a statistic that is backed up by the Torrey et. al. statewide study conducted in 2014 in Virginia; our textbook cites various studies that claim a range from less than a quarter to almost half of all US inmates “had a mental health problem” (Erickson & Erickson, 2008). Whatever the true number, it would seem that a system already overcapacity is also under the added and considerable burden of housing and dealing with the majority of the nation’s mentally ill.Because prisons and jails are not designed, staffed, or organized with mental health or treatment in mind, the hundreds of thousands of individuals with mental illnesses who find themselves incarcerated every year face an almost inevitable path of infractions, segregation, longer sentences, and the total collapse of any coping skills they may have had up until that point, also known as decompensation. Essentially, because “the prison does not exist to provide mental health treatment,” but rather to provide “safety and security to the community,” behavior that is symptomatic of the individual’s mental illness will inevitably be seen as disciplinary misconduct and treated accordingly by a staff that is prepped to quell violence and disruption harshly and unanimously (Navasky & O’Connor, 2005). To be specific, the disruptive behavior that is often a direct result of their mental illness and anguish results in extended stays in segregation and near-constant visits from extraction teams, the SWAT teams of the incarceration world who wear riot gear and bum-rush these individuals into brute submission. A life spent largely in solitary confinement with only delusions and psychotic episodes for company, punctuated by the occasional extraction visit, all but ensures that, as pointed out by the film, those who enter incarceration mentally ill invariably get worse and those who enter mentally normative invariably become to some degree mentally ill. Indeed, a federal judge stated in the opinion written after Madrid v. Gomez that placing these vulnerable inmates into solitary confinement “is the mental equivalent of putting an asthmatic in a place with little air to breathe” (Haney, 2017).Cause of the IssueDeinstitutionalization is inarguably the root cause of our prisons and jails becoming the de facto mental health solution of the United States. One thing that is crucial to understanding many themes and trends within the criminal justice history of the United States is the historical tendency for our policies and practices to swing from one end of the pendulum (the crime-control model, in which public safety is the number one priority) to the other (due process, wherein concern for the constitutional rights of individuals brought before the state take precedence). Indeed, it was the accepted practice to house the mentally ill in jails and prisons for the beginning of our nation’s history — just as we do today — until the nineteenth century, when the switch was made to the state-run hospitals and asylums that quickly became overrun and understaffed. In turn, this became the norm until the aforementioned deinstitutionalization of the mid-twentieth century (Torrey et. al., 2016). While many people would perhaps be quick to assume that the mass closure and downsizing of most state mental hospitals in America was the result of callous financial and political games, it was actually an empathetic and compassionate (if not short-sighted) response to what had become atrocious conditions and overcrowding, leaving the country’s most vulnerable in deplorable conditions. The well-intentioned idea was that the warehousing of mentally ill people in these asylums would be replaced by intimate and personalized community treatment, wherein society would take care of their own from the bottom up. While this is the ideal solution, the doors of state mental hospitals were closed en masse with very little of the necessary community infrastructure in place or even the ability to do so. The results were predictable, in hindsight: an exodus of people with very little social support or coping skills to the streets and underpasses of America.Simultaneously, the pendulum of the American criminal justice system has been swinging inexorably back towards the crime-control model ever since the civil rights era, meaning that the socially unacceptable or even frightening or bewildering behavior displayed by a mentally ill and homeless person going about their day began to be routinely greeted with arrest and incarceration. Haney speaks to the “decontextualization of criminality, which has greatly expanded the reach of the criminal justice system and removed consideration of social factors…from the sentencing calculus”; the routine arrest of people who are at worst in a state of psychosis is the culmination of this trend.Whereas the index crimes for the vast majority of the incarcerated mentally ill in America are nonviolent and extremely minor, upon incarceration their behavior is naturally exacerbated and worsened by the environment itself, which has marked effects on even the correctional officers and administrative staff who get to leave at the end of the workday. The fear and violence of the prison environment is almost entirely antithetical to the one in which mentally ill individuals should be. One inmate filmed for the documentary perfectly illustrated the results of what Haney termed an “ecology of cruelty”: Carl McEachron, sent to prison for a crime that carried with it a maximum sentence of 3 years, had spent 16 years in prison at the time of filming due to infractions and violations directly related to his mental illness (Haney, 2017; Navasky & O’Connor, 2005).Solutions to the IssueWhile a feasible solution may appear too daunting to consider, there is a welcome and encouraging consensus in the literature regarding how to begin to mediate this public health crisis. For example, almost all professionals even tangentially involved in this problem agree that “individuals with severe mental disorders who are in need of treatment belong in hospitals, not in prisons and jails” (Torrey et. al., 2016). The mass implementation of Crisis Intervention Training across law enforcement agencies, as well as their partnership with Acute Trauma Units and advocacy services, could prevent thousands of arrests and recidivisms every year. Keeping these people in the community and on top of their medication management and well-being makes good fiscal as well as moral sense, not to mention the public safety component. As the director of Ohio’s corrections stated in the documentary, he became not only a prison warden but a mental health director when he accepted the job; no aspect of our current correctional system is prepared for or geared towards this type of massive social responsibility.My Thoughts/Opinions on the FilmI was extremely struck by the footage that this documentary showed from the archives of the prisons themselves: watching mentally disturbed and possibly psychotic inmates get tactically and brutally subdued by men in masks and riot gear and dragged out of the tiny cells in which they spend their entire lives gave me a chilling sense of perspective into the type of horrifying reality these individuals live in when they are left in a cell without adequate treatment or medication. Our textbook decried the asylums and hospitals that prisons replaced, where “hoods were placed on patients’ heads in an effort to quiet their minds” (Erickson & Erickson, 2008). This film did an excellent job of showing just how far contemporary prisons have gone in their efforts to fill their predecessor’s shoes.CitationsErickson, P. E., & Erickson, S. K. (2008).

Recognizing Emerging Mental Illness,https://medium.com/@kartardiamond/recognizing-emerging-mental-illness-e6effce5cab7?source=tag_archive---------6-----------------------,"Mentall Illness,Misdiagnosis,Self Medicating,Drug Use","Photo by MaximoRecognizing mental illness when it first emerges can be extremely difficult, even for family members who are so familiar with the personality and character of their suffering loved one. This can be an agonizing and fear-inducing predicament for obvious reasons. What makes the recognition of mental illness so challenging can be blamed on several factors.Firstly, the average person is not expected to be educated about mental illness, unless they already have someone in their life with a well-established mental illness. Some cultures make people extraordinarily uncomfortable with even speculating that a family member could be ill and they procrastinate in seeking out professional help or even discussing it privately. Because there is a lot of stigma associated with mental illnesses, both the sufferer and their family may want to assume anything else could be going on besides a diagnosis which can alter a person’s life forever and profoundly.When mental illness first manifests, if the person experiencing it is young, like a teenager, their odd behaviors and symptoms could be hastily written off as the result of teenage hormones. Young males especially can engage in risky, aggressive, or manic behaviors that are misinterpreted precisely because of their youth and immaturity.Because of the prevalence of drug abuse in our society, it’s also a common reflexive response for family members to think that their ill child or sibling may be acting strange and unpredictable because they are under the influence of drugs or alcohol. In fact, even when we suspect that a person may have psychological issues, we still consider the possibility that their most disturbing symptoms could be caused by self-medicating with drugs. During one of my own son’s longer hospitalizations, I was stunned to find out he was not under the influence of street drugs when he committed some very anti-social behaviors.Another reason why it is so hard to recognize emerging mental illness is because some people are actually fairly good at hiding it for a while, intentionally or not. Parents are often told to notice if their child suddenly withdraws from their friends, starts doing poorly in school, or seems to have a sudden personality shift. These are important clues, but some kids or young adults can still pretend they are doing fine when they are not, until something really dramatic or explosive happens, taking everyone by surprise.We also need to separate out what may be defined clinically as a personality disorder or a mood disorder, compared with full-blown serious mental illness. For example, anxiety can be very concerning and debilitating. Some behaviors associated with anxiety can even reveal and underlying psychotic process. But there is a world of difference between general anxiety disorder and schizophrenia.There are clinical descriptions of what constitutes a mental illness, but some of those behaviors and symptoms need to occur continuously over at least a six month period of time before it can be confirmed. It is also very common for diagnoses to change as more and different symptoms emerge. Psychiatrists do their best to be accurate, but they do not have any type of physical examination to determine a mental disorder. In fact, sometimes they can only come to conclusions based on what the mentally ill person admits to them. When a person with a thought disorder relays their own symptoms, their perceptions and memories could be far from accurate or objective. Further, it is also common for people to have a co-occurring diagnosis. For example, a person may have both anxiety and depression. A person diagnosed with both schizophrenia and a mood disorder is referred to as schizoaffective disorder. The term “dual diagnosis” now implies a mental illness along with a substance abuse disorder.Some medications address targeted issues, but with a misdiagnosis the side effects can be substantial. For instance, if a person initially acts depressed, they may be prescribed an anti-depressant. If the person actually has bipolar disorder, the anti-depressant could propel the person into a manic episode. Most of us have heard the commercials on TV with the long list of scary side-effects from medications. The wrong prescription could increase a person’s symptoms or cause completely different ones, including suicidal ideation.Roughly 20% of the general population will experience some form of psychological stress at points in their life which is significant enough to warrant professional help. Being depressed over genuinely stressful life events like divorce or job loss will eventually subside when circumstances improve and when temporary therapy or other treatments are utilized. Serious mental illness, however, needs to be managed for a life time, often with unsatisfactory results.One thing for sure is that the more we openly discuss mental illness, the less stigmatized it will become. In turn, more people will seek out treatment sooner and compliance to medication or therapy will also be more successful.Written byKartar DiamondFeng Shui consultant, author & teacher since 1992. www.FengShuiSolutions.net I also write about other metaphysical topics and mental health advocacy.Follow1 1 1 Mentall IllnessMisdiagnosisSelf MedicatingDrug UseMore from Kartar DiamondFollowFeng Shui consultant, author & teacher since 1992. www.FengShuiSolutions.net I also write about other metaphysical topics and mental health advocacy.More From MediumWhy Disconnecting Made Me Feel More ConnectedEvan McCoy in Invisible IllnessWhen Everyone Thinks You’re Overreacting, But You’re NotRuss W in Invisible IllnessThe Underestimated Ways Depression Can Enrich Your LifeCarine Ru in Invisible IllnessDoes My Inflamed Brain Make Me Suicidal?Toni Tails in SURVIVORSHow Pottery Helped Me Overcome My AnxietyDaniel A in The AscentWhat It’s Like to Know You’ll Be on Antidepressants for LifeDanielle Tcholakian in The Cut10 Quotes to Help You Find Hope During the Coronavirus PandemicCynthia Perkins, M.Ed. in Invisible IllnessAnxiety: How My First Bully Became My Oldest FriendCharlotte Buelow in The AscentAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

My story of OCPD: how I subconsciously stopped myself from living my best life,https://medium.com/@ivana.musich/my-story-of-ocpd-how-i-subconsciously-stopped-myself-from-living-my-best-life-9f961034e303?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Mentall Illness,Mental Health,Self,Self Improvement,Ocd","Mental illness, or whatever I thought that meant, did not apply to me. I did not suffer from one, nor have I been diagnosed with one. This all changed when a friend, who happens to be a life coach, challenged me to read more about mental disorders. One disorder in particular resonated very closely with my life.What is mental illness anyway? It can be defined as a pattern that causes distress or impairment of personal functioning, affecting how a person behaves, feels, perceives, or thinks. When we think of mental illness we may think of extreme cases where it is preventing a person from living their day to day life. The notion of ‘functioning’ is subjective. Even if you haven’t been diagnosed with a mental disorder, what if there was something lingering in the background, affecting your life in ways that are not as subtle as you think?I immersed myself in research and discovered Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder or OCPD. Health professionals describe it as “a personality disorder characterized by excessive concern with orderliness, perfectionism, attention to details, mental and interpersonal control, and a need for control over one’s environment, which interferes with flexibility, openness to experience.” Developed as a coping mechanism unconsciously in childhood, I now realize it is actually preventing me from manifesting the life I want to live as an adult.My research uncovered that people who have OCPD likely grew up with over-involved and overprotective parents who expected their strict rules to be followed. Disobedience to those rules was followed by punishment and grounding. These children, as a result, learned that in order to survive at home they needed to be perfect. They received praise for ‘being good’. Experts say that this can be labeled as learned behaviour, or in other words, a coping mechanism. Children start to believe that they need to follow the rules and be a good girl/boy, because if they don’t, they would disrupt everything in their environment, and therefore, it was their responsibility to ‘keep it together’.What a tall order.What I ‘learned’ is that I must do everything in my power to keep the order, to prevent the adults from freaking out, to prevent being grounded. As an adult, this developed a belief that, if I go toward what I desire (or break cultural rules), I will be punished. How do I avoid this so-called punishment? I try to control everything — things that are in my control and things that are not. (The illusion is that I think I can control everything). I’ve become accustomed to thinking that everything needs to be a certain way in order for me to feel safe and good about myself. There is a complete lack of trust in life and the unknown. There is very little room for risk-taking.Therefore I feel like I can conclude that for me personally, not manifesting my desires is my subconscious attempt at survival. I always thought I was living my best life, but when I reflect back on what living has looked like for me, it was merely survival, since I was too afraid to go after what I truly desired, in fear of punishment.How does such a person go in the direction of their dreams? How does someone manifest that which they want for themselves? They don’t. It doesn’t feel safe. It is better to manifest that which others approve of, leading to manifesting what is accepted culturally or socially, or even literally manifesting for others (making sure others are okay first, attending to their needs before your own).A perfectionist in the makingFor example, I have realized with my OCPD that I need to feel accomplished. As such, it is rare for me to take a day off and not check something off my list. I would consider that a waste of a day. I was so obsessed with efficiency that I would schedule activities weeks in advance, my calendar would be so detailed and planned out, there was no possibility to deviate from it. If everything is to be done from a place of accomplishment and the need to check off boxes, it would make sense that my life revolves around work. One way I centered my life around work was by living close to the office so that my commute would be short, so that I could maximize my day, so that I would have time after work to go to more places faster. Do you see the control? The thought of getting a dog was so overwhelming because it would throw a wrench in my calendar. The thought of jeopardizing my efficiency would send me into a panic. I would feel completely trapped by this mental narrative.OCPD has a positive side (there are two sides to any coin). It can make you productive, motivated, and efficient (a trait that’s extremely valuable at work). Individuals with OCPD are detail-oriented, take initiative, are reliable, loyal, and responsible. They think of the worst-case scenario all the time and then plan for it. It can make them an invaluable asset to a business and their boss.So, the point here is not to try to eliminate the OCPD or pretend it is not there. The alternative is to first understand where it comes from, and then to embrace where it can add value to my life, instead of letting it control me. Big difference. So instead of eliminating something that will likely never go away, I want to be able to pinpoint how it has had a negative effect on my life; how it has created a story and an illusion that I’m living and thriving, when I’m really not. The idea is to challenge the story created by OCPD in order to extend trust in life, the universe, whatever you want to call it. Stepping out of the confines of my made-up schedule and need to control outcomes can actually lead to better, unimaginable outcomes. With OCPD, you only know what you know, and you don’t even try to know what you don’t know. That is not a life well-lived.How do I catch myself now? When I start to spiral I ask myself a number of questions, such as:Am I controlling the outcome here?How am I being inflexible and what is it I am trying to protect myself from?Am I rescuing someone else? Why?Am I impressing someone else, or seeking to be validated?Am I making up chaos (story) in my head?These days I am trying to challenge my OCPD and the story it has created by consciously throwing a wrench in my schedule. And trying to move further away from downtown to escape that ‘go go go’ mentality. My OCPD will always be there, but with this newfound awareness, I want to consciously direct it in ways where it will be useful, and challenge it when it is not.Have you ever tried to identify what could be a mental health issue for you?

Mental Illness and Abuse. How Living Through It Can Make You Stronger,https://medium.com/@joannharris-53598/mental-illness-and-abuse-how-living-through-it-can-make-you-stronger-279ad060776c?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Addiction,Mentall Illness,Abuse,Emotional Abuse,Money","If you live or have lived with someone who had/has mental illness resulting in abuse to you I have a few insights from the pain I endured at the time that was happening to me.Somehow I always knew it would not last forever. I knew at some point it would be over one way or another. It took many years to accomplish this but it did end.His was acting wild, erratic, hyper-emotional, unstable, abusive, which resulted in being more of an alcoholic than I had ever scene. He would say he was going out for smokes and never return. The first time he did this it put me in panic mode. I called everyone of his friends to see if he was with them. Then it all bounced back on me as I asked myself if I had done something to cause this as I had never had such a thing happen to me before. We had only known each other a year or so and it never came up.He would finally come back the next day without any explanation. I asked him about what happened trying to get some understanding, but he didn’t feel he needed to explain. “Don’t bust my balls about it!” I left him alone.MENTAL ILLNESSIt all started for me about four to six years or so before my twin boys were born in another country. They are now twenty-five and doing well. Their Dad committed suicide from having schizo-effective disorder and being on so many psychiatric drugs so he could function. He felt that as well.In the end he fell and didn’t get treatment immediately. He was obnoxious, angry, and wouldn’t let anyone help him. He went to a doctor but lied about all the medications he was on. The doctor prescribed Morphine for his pain.DEATHThis was a grave mistake because my husband had an addictive nature. He also had been a drug addict in his early life, so he ultimately took an overdose on purpose. His boys were eleven.It is really a difficult to impossible feat to tell your children that their Dad killed himself.That was a very unusual day. We were divorced at the time and he was living with his brother. Their cousin was helping them move into an apartment a few days earlier. I got a call at work from the cousin just panicked to find her cousin, my ex, dead in bed. She had gone over to check on him and to bring more belongings.She kept asking, “What do I do?, What do I do?” I just told her to call the police to report it and I would be over presently.I assumed he felt he was wasting his life, so why not. It would be better for himself and everyone involved. He just gave up. He had nothing to live for in the state the drugs put him in and he could not live without them. He was supposed to go to psychotherapy but never wanted to do that.By the time I got there the police were there along with the Medical Examiner taking note of the scene. They found him dead and had fallen asleep with a cigarette hanging over an ashtray burned to the nub which was how he went to sleep. He smoked like a chimney. An addiction he had since he was a teen among other things. The Medical Examiner saw all the vials of drugs that he had been prescribed and just shook her head.His brother and cousin were in the living room really upset and crying, etc. His brother saying, “If I had only . . . .” I told him not to do that as his brother didn’t want any help and couldn’t let anyone do anything for him. He was stubborn like that.I did not cry. I was relieved of this burden in my life. I felt free, finally.After a bit he was wheeled out. They put up a sheet so no one could see him in his final state. I did not cry. I was relieved of this burden in my life. I felt free, finally.PAINI went back to work to check on things so I could leave for the day. I had to tell my children what happened.One of them had called the office complaining of being sick to his stomach. I went to the school and picked him up but left the other to finish out his day. No reason really to bring this to his attention before I was ready.I told the son that I had picked up from school what had happened that day after we got home. He was very upset and cried and I held him. He said he felt better after that. Then he went to take a nap.I waited for the other son to come home from school on the bus and then told him what happened. He was in the middle of gaming, sniffed a minute and went on playing. I thought that was not good but I thought it was better to wait for him to ask any questions then to cause more pain.They both knew how their Dad was being through multiple psychotic episodes that just resulted in him going to the VA to get his medications adjusted and staying for a few weeks until he calmed down. He had also scared them a few times and I was afraid he would eventually hurt them.A week or so later we had a small service with only a few people showing up. He had previously ostracized himself from his family, cousins, aunts, uncles, etc. because of his bad behavior that they had to endure most of their whole life. His Mom and Dad had passed away prior to this.The children released balloons and said goodbye. His brother and cousin took care of the burial. We didn’t go to the funeral either. I was too damned angry at him and I didn’t want the boys to have to go through whatever all that would have come to.LESSONS LEARNEDGod, Life, the Universe puts you here on Earth to teach you lessons so you can get more out of life.The StageEighteen years of marriage.Mental instability.Psychotic episodes.AngerAbuse — financially, mentally, emotionally and threats of physical violence.HomelessnessMove to another country out of group agreement.Twin boysMissing in Florida.Alcohol and drugsPrescription psychotic drugsIsolationYou can read more about this here.The Narcissist and the LadyKeep It All A Secretmedium.comWhat I have learned so far:Mental Strength — I learned to rely on myself and to find stability in my life by getting sanity back.For years I did not want to think for myself. I wanted him to think for me and create our life. For a long time he acted as if he could. When many setbacks occurred he went into a deep depression and started sleeping all day, every day.When that started I did not have the mental cohesiveness to cope and organize. I also did not have the financial independence to make our life better in the down times.My Voice — I learned to have a voice.I was always shy and afraid of everything. I was always second guessing myself and being very introverted. I was a very quiet person. I still am but in a different way. I found that if I didn’t speak up for what I wanted I would never get out, ever get it, and things would never get better.Wisdom — I learned a lot about a lot of things.I am glad that I was forty-four when I had the twins. He threatened to harm them more than once inside and outside the womb.If I had been younger I don’t think I could have cared for them and kept them safe as I was a follower instead of a leader. I was also extremely self-centered. You can’t be any of that when you have babies or baby.I also learned that if someone tells you who they are believe them. This was mentioned by Maya Angelo, the wisest person and the most beautiful teacher of the world. Very sad she is gone now but her books and sayings will live forever.I didn’t believe him when he told me he used to be a drug dealer, carried a gun, and spent 28 months in prison. I just didn’t believe him. It was too much for my poor, sheltered, inexperienced mind to comprehend. I know better now.Do Not Isolate Yourself — Stay connected to your family, friends, church members, communities. You can’t do anything all by yourself. Others can help and usually are willing.When we moved to Costa Rica and he said I did not need to know the language to live there, I believed him. That was wrong, just wrong.Costa Rica is a Spanish speaking country. My husband lived in Italy as a child so he was familiar with the Italian language and Spanish are similar.It would have been smart of me to have learned some Spanish before going there. I was willing but he shut me off to everyone. When we moved there people would come over and drink or party and I was left alone in another room or looked at funny. As if I was odd. I was also the one to furnish and clean up after these visitors both American and Costa Rican. No one was interested in me or how I felt about anything. He totally ridiculed me to others behind my back.We did not have a phone to call the USA. We did not have a television to enjoy some entertainment. I had no friends or if I did he ran them off with his destructive actions. He would be so obnoxious and angry when he drank that they did not want to come around again.It was like living in a bubble. You heard sounds but no meaning. This went on for a year. Remember Charlie Brown when adults talked, it was “wha, wha, wha, wha.” Same with me because I did not know Spanish.I also felt emotionally frozen, mentally flat, and alone.When I got pregnant I did find a doctor who spoke English. He was very kind and I liked him a lot but he never thought I was having twins. He was a General Practitioner/Family doctor. He was not the one that did the sonogram where we only saw one baby. But still I was bigger than a mother having one child should be. He should have thought differently or referred me to someone else.We all went out to eat a few times but my husband always took over the conversation and monopolized our fun. He drank and became obnoxious and disrespectful to a lot of people. I think the doctor didn’t like him either. The doctor also never came to the birth or to the hospital later. That’s probably why.Money — Don’t abuse it.We suffered a lot over those years. He worked for himself so sometimes there was a lot of money, sometimes there wasn’t. I worked as office support most of the time which is okay pay but not enough when there is an emergency. Even when you can’t pay bills or buy food that’s stressful.I did not have much earning power then and sometimes he would just not work. He slept a lot. I suppose he always suffered from depression and I did not know it. I thought it was just being lazy.I could not make my own decisions about money either until after he was gone. That was a huge freedom I had. I knew how to budget, pay bills, etc. but I did not know how to deal with no money and you still had to pay bills and such. It was extremely stressful.Abusive behavior when money is concerned is just wrong. He was an alcoholic and would go to bars and burn $100 dollar bills while people watched. Money we could have used for whatever. What made him act like that? Hard to say.Now I have earning power, and was the breadwinner for a long time. Retirement has put a stick in that but I still am the one that pays the bills and buys the food. I can make my own decisions where money is concerned as well.Other thoughtsI still have some issues when it comes to people, trust, love, other people’s motivations, etc. I suppose therapy could help.I am in a relationship now after twelve years with no one. I just don’t want anything to go badly. We have the freedom to be each other. No one tries to change the other. We just root for each other. We help each other and enjoy each other’s company. We care for each other and we are respectful to each other. It’s going on three years and I hope it lasts for awhile.That was what was missing a long time ago.Respect! It is very important.FinallyOne take-away from this would be to never give in to loneliness, isolation, defeat, ridicule, stress, anxiety or to threats.Keep in your mind that it will be over one day and you will have your freedom again. You will come out stronger as well.Jo Ann Harris is an author, parent, book devotee, writer, copywriter, and film fanatic. She is an autodidact who learns about everything and rows her own boat.

You lose all your hope, trust, and feel like a failure. I think that I’m a complete failure and worthless.Desperate is different from depression. Nevertheless, desperate can cause depression.

It isn’t straightforward when you lose your faith and give up on everything that you’ve manifested for it.Why do people get so desperate?A lot of people desperate because they can’t get what they’ve planned, frantic because they can’t revenge with a thing that will make their enemies mum, desperately seeking validation, or desperate because they were left by their loved one and so many more.Desperate is not only a condition when you want to hurt yourself or either kill yourself. It can also make someone want to harm others to express their hurts.How to deal with it?Like I’ve stated, desperate is different from depression. When you’re depressed, you lack energy, and thus you’re fatigued, resulting in some physical ailments like digestive problems, body ache, loss of appetite, etc. Like you feel you can’t do something because you know you’ll fail.But when you’re desperate, you’re loaded with energy to accomplish the task or get the work done. Also, you’re prepared to go to any extent by taking all sorts of risks — which what I’ve done recently. I still have so much ambition in myself self, but the world is not on my side, so I failed, and I’m losing my hope. Yet, when I fall, it will hit me so hard because it seems I’ve drained so much energy and time to achieve what I want.The best way to cope with desperate is to break for a while. Break, but don’t stop. You are just facing the bitterness of life, so you have to reflects what the world or God wants you to be.I needed somewhere to cry and not feel so alone, been going through a lot for a long time. I think for all of you, and I’m so sorry we’re all going through these feelings. It’s okay. For the right thoughts are not always your thoughts, neither are your ways my waysThe thing is, those of us who are drowning and cope with depression because of desperate might not realize it. Feel like a failure is okay. But, don’t forget to recover and stand up better. Those of us who are unspeakably ill might not even know that such an illness exists. Always mark in your mind that some mental illness isn’t something to be ashamed of.It’s okay to be sad. It’s okay to feel blue. I’m here to listen to all your miseries.Written byEliz PellokilaShe loves random and bizarre things.

N/A,https://medium.com/@Molly8/decompensation-e883858d1d06?source=tag_archive---------5-----------------------,"Prison Reform,Mentall Illness,Corrections,Frontline","Decompensation:How The Asylums of Last Resort are Failing Our Most Vulnerable PopulationsMolly HuffColorado Mesa UniversityDecompensation, by Todd (Hyung-Rae) Tarselli, a mentally ill prisoner in a super-maximum Pennsylvania facilityThe SummaryEssentially, this documentary was a representative example of the mental health crisis in America today; while Ohio and its correctional system specifically was the focus of the film, these scenarios and stories could have been from any prison — any state — in our country. The film estimated that there are approximately ten times as many mentally ill individuals incarcerated in America as there are mentally ill people in mental health treatment facilities and environments, a statistic that is backed up by the Torrey et. al. statewide study conducted in 2014 in Virginia; our textbook cites various studies that claim a range from less than a quarter to almost half of all US inmates “had a mental health problem” (Erickson & Erickson, 2008). Whatever the true number, it would seem that a system already overcapacity is also under the added and considerable burden of housing and dealing with the majority of the nation’s mentally ill.Because prisons and jails are not designed, staffed, or organized with mental health or treatment in mind, the hundreds of thousands of individuals with mental illnesses who find themselves incarcerated every year face an almost inevitable path of infractions, segregation, longer sentences, and the total collapse of any coping skills they may have had up until that point, also known as decompensation. Essentially, because “the prison does not exist to provide mental health treatment,” but rather to provide “safety and security to the community,” behavior that is symptomatic of the individual’s mental illness will inevitably be seen as disciplinary misconduct and treated accordingly by a staff that is prepped to quell violence and disruption harshly and unanimously (Navasky & O’Connor, 2005). To be specific, the disruptive behavior that is often a direct result of their mental illness and anguish results in extended stays in segregation and near-constant visits from extraction teams, the SWAT teams of the incarceration world who wear riot gear and bum-rush these individuals into brute submission. A life spent largely in solitary confinement with only delusions and psychotic episodes for company, punctuated by the occasional extraction visit, all but ensures that, as pointed out by the film, those who enter incarceration mentally ill invariably get worse and those who enter mentally normative invariably become to some degree mentally ill. Indeed, a federal judge stated in the opinion written after Madrid v. Gomez that placing these vulnerable inmates into solitary confinement “is the mental equivalent of putting an asthmatic in a place with little air to breathe” (Haney, 2017).Cause of the IssueDeinstitutionalization is inarguably the root cause of our prisons and jails becoming the de facto mental health solution of the United States. One thing that is crucial to understanding many themes and trends within the criminal justice history of the United States is the historical tendency for our policies and practices to swing from one end of the pendulum (the crime-control model, in which public safety is the number one priority) to the other (due process, wherein concern for the constitutional rights of individuals brought before the state take precedence). Indeed, it was the accepted practice to house the mentally ill in jails and prisons for the beginning of our nation’s history — just as we do today — until the nineteenth century, when the switch was made to the state-run hospitals and asylums that quickly became overrun and understaffed. In turn, this became the norm until the aforementioned deinstitutionalization of the mid-twentieth century (Torrey et. al., 2016). While many people would perhaps be quick to assume that the mass closure and downsizing of most state mental hospitals in America was the result of callous financial and political games, it was actually an empathetic and compassionate (if not short-sighted) response to what had become atrocious conditions and overcrowding, leaving the country’s most vulnerable in deplorable conditions. The well-intentioned idea was that the warehousing of mentally ill people in these asylums would be replaced by intimate and personalized community treatment, wherein society would take care of their own from the bottom up. While this is the ideal solution, the doors of state mental hospitals were closed en masse with very little of the necessary community infrastructure in place or even the ability to do so. The results were predictable, in hindsight: an exodus of people with very little social support or coping skills to the streets and underpasses of America.Simultaneously, the pendulum of the American criminal justice system has been swinging inexorably back towards the crime-control model ever since the civil rights era, meaning that the socially unacceptable or even frightening or bewildering behavior displayed by a mentally ill and homeless person going about their day began to be routinely greeted with arrest and incarceration. Haney speaks to the “decontextualization of criminality, which has greatly expanded the reach of the criminal justice system and removed consideration of social factors…from the sentencing calculus”; the routine arrest of people who are at worst in a state of psychosis is the culmination of this trend.Whereas the index crimes for the vast majority of the incarcerated mentally ill in America are nonviolent and extremely minor, upon incarceration their behavior is naturally exacerbated and worsened by the environment itself, which has marked effects on even the correctional officers and administrative staff who get to leave at the end of the workday. The fear and violence of the prison environment is almost entirely antithetical to the one in which mentally ill individuals should be. One inmate filmed for the documentary perfectly illustrated the results of what Haney termed an “ecology of cruelty”: Carl McEachron, sent to prison for a crime that carried with it a maximum sentence of 3 years, had spent 16 years in prison at the time of filming due to infractions and violations directly related to his mental illness (Haney, 2017; Navasky & O’Connor, 2005).Solutions to the IssueWhile a feasible solution may appear too daunting to consider, there is a welcome and encouraging consensus in the literature regarding how to begin to mediate this public health crisis. For example, almost all professionals even tangentially involved in this problem agree that “individuals with severe mental disorders who are in need of treatment belong in hospitals, not in prisons and jails” (Torrey et. al., 2016). The mass implementation of Crisis Intervention Training across law enforcement agencies, as well as their partnership with Acute Trauma Units and advocacy services, could prevent thousands of arrests and recidivisms every year. Keeping these people in the community and on top of their medication management and well-being makes good fiscal as well as moral sense, not to mention the public safety component. As the director of Ohio’s corrections stated in the documentary, he became not only a prison warden but a mental health director when he accepted the job; no aspect of our current correctional system is prepared for or geared towards this type of massive social responsibility.My Thoughts/Opinions on the FilmI was extremely struck by the footage that this documentary showed from the archives of the prisons themselves: watching mentally disturbed and possibly psychotic inmates get tactically and brutally subdued by men in masks and riot gear and dragged out of the tiny cells in which they spend their entire lives gave me a chilling sense of perspective into the type of horrifying reality these individuals live in when they are left in a cell without adequate treatment or medication. Our textbook decried the asylums and hospitals that prisons replaced, where “hoods were placed on patients’ heads in an effort to quiet their minds” (Erickson & Erickson, 2008). This film did an excellent job of showing just how far contemporary prisons have gone in their efforts to fill their predecessor’s shoes.CitationsErickson, P. E., & Erickson, S. K. (2008).

Recognizing Emerging Mental Illness,https://medium.com/@kartardiamond/recognizing-emerging-mental-illness-e6effce5cab7?source=tag_archive---------6-----------------------,"Mentall Illness,Misdiagnosis,Self Medicating,Drug Use","Photo by MaximoRecognizing mental illness when it first emerges can be extremely difficult, even for family members who are so familiar with the personality and character of their suffering loved one. This can be an agonizing and fear-inducing predicament for obvious reasons. What makes the recognition of mental illness so challenging can be blamed on several factors.Firstly, the average person is not expected to be educated about mental illness, unless they already have someone in their life with a well-established mental illness. Some cultures make people extraordinarily uncomfortable with even speculating that a family member could be ill and they procrastinate in seeking out professional help or even discussing it privately. Because there is a lot of stigma associated with mental illnesses, both the sufferer and their family may want to assume anything else could be going on besides a diagnosis which can alter a person’s life forever and profoundly.When mental illness first manifests, if the person experiencing it is young, like a teenager, their odd behaviors and symptoms could be hastily written off as the result of teenage hormones. Young males especially can engage in risky, aggressive, or manic behaviors that are misinterpreted precisely because of their youth and immaturity.Because of the prevalence of drug abuse in our society, it’s also a common reflexive response for family members to think that their ill child or sibling may be acting strange and unpredictable because they are under the influence of drugs or alcohol. In fact, even when we suspect that a person may have psychological issues, we still consider the possibility that their most disturbing symptoms could be caused by self-medicating with drugs. During one of my own son’s longer hospitalizations, I was stunned to find out he was not under the influence of street drugs when he committed some very anti-social behaviors.Another reason why it is so hard to recognize emerging mental illness is because some people are actually fairly good at hiding it for a while, intentionally or not. Parents are often told to notice if their child suddenly withdraws from their friends, starts doing poorly in school, or seems to have a sudden personality shift. These are important clues, but some kids or young adults can still pretend they are doing fine when they are not, until something really dramatic or explosive happens, taking everyone by surprise.We also need to separate out what may be defined clinically as a personality disorder or a mood disorder, compared with full-blown serious mental illness. For example, anxiety can be very concerning and debilitating. Some behaviors associated with anxiety can even reveal and underlying psychotic process. But there is a world of difference between general anxiety disorder and schizophrenia.There are clinical descriptions of what constitutes a mental illness, but some of those behaviors and symptoms need to occur continuously over at least a six month period of time before it can be confirmed. It is also very common for diagnoses to change as more and different symptoms emerge. Psychiatrists do their best to be accurate, but they do not have any type of physical examination to determine a mental disorder. In fact, sometimes they can only come to conclusions based on what the mentally ill person admits to them. When a person with a thought disorder relays their own symptoms, their perceptions and memories could be far from accurate or objective. Further, it is also common for people to have a co-occurring diagnosis. For example, a person may have both anxiety and depression. A person diagnosed with both schizophrenia and a mood disorder is referred to as schizoaffective disorder. The term “dual diagnosis” now implies a mental illness along with a substance abuse disorder.Some medications address targeted issues, but with a misdiagnosis the side effects can be substantial. For instance, if a person initially acts depressed, they may be prescribed an anti-depressant. If the person actually has bipolar disorder, the anti-depressant could propel the person into a manic episode. Most of us have heard the commercials on TV with the long list of scary side-effects from medications. The wrong prescription could increase a person’s symptoms or cause completely different ones, including suicidal ideation.Roughly 20% of the general population will experience some form of psychological stress at points in their life which is significant enough to warrant professional help. Being depressed over genuinely stressful life events like divorce or job loss will eventually subside when circumstances improve and when temporary therapy or other treatments are utilized. Serious mental illness, however, needs to be managed for a life time, often with unsatisfactory results.One thing for sure is that the more we openly discuss mental illness, the less stigmatized it will become. In turn, more people will seek out treatment sooner and compliance to medication or therapy will also be more successful.Written byKartar DiamondFeng Shui consultant, author & teacher since 1992. www.FengShuiSolutions.net I also write about other metaphysical topics and mental health advocacy.Follow1 1 1 Mentall IllnessMisdiagnosisSelf MedicatingDrug UseMore from Kartar DiamondFollowFeng Shui consultant, author & teacher since 1992. www.FengShuiSolutions.net I also write about other metaphysical topics and mental health advocacy.More From MediumWhy Disconnecting Made Me Feel More ConnectedEvan McCoy in Invisible IllnessWhen Everyone Thinks You’re Overreacting, But You’re NotRuss W in Invisible IllnessThe Underestimated Ways Depression Can Enrich Your LifeCarine Ru in Invisible IllnessDoes My Inflamed Brain Make Me Suicidal?Toni Tails in SURVIVORSHow Pottery Helped Me Overcome My AnxietyDaniel A in The AscentWhat It’s Like to Know You’ll Be on Antidepressants for LifeDanielle Tcholakian in The Cut10 Quotes to Help You Find Hope During the Coronavirus PandemicCynthia Perkins, M.Ed. in Invisible IllnessAnxiety: How My First Bully Became My Oldest FriendCharlotte Buelow in The AscentAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

My story of OCPD: how I subconsciously stopped myself from living my best life,https://medium.com/@ivana.musich/my-story-of-ocpd-how-i-subconsciously-stopped-myself-from-living-my-best-life-9f961034e303?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Mentall Illness,Mental Health,Self,Self Improvement,Ocd","Mental illness, or whatever I thought that meant, did not apply to me. I did not suffer from one, nor have I been diagnosed with one. This all changed when a friend, who happens to be a life coach, challenged me to read more about mental disorders. One disorder in particular resonated very closely with my life.What is mental illness anyway? It can be defined as a pattern that causes distress or impairment of personal functioning, affecting how a person behaves, feels, perceives, or thinks. When we think of mental illness we may think of extreme cases where it is preventing a person from living their day to day life. The notion of ‘functioning’ is subjective. Even if you haven’t been diagnosed with a mental disorder, what if there was something lingering in the background, affecting your life in ways that are not as subtle as you think?I immersed myself in research and discovered Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder or OCPD. Health professionals describe it as “a personality disorder characterized by excessive concern with orderliness, perfectionism, attention to details, mental and interpersonal control, and a need for control over one’s environment, which interferes with flexibility, openness to experience.” Developed as a coping mechanism unconsciously in childhood, I now realize it is actually preventing me from manifesting the life I want to live as an adult.My research uncovered that people who have OCPD likely grew up with over-involved and overprotective parents who expected their strict rules to be followed. Disobedience to those rules was followed by punishment and grounding. These children, as a result, learned that in order to survive at home they needed to be perfect. They received praise for ‘being good’. Experts say that this can be labeled as learned behaviour, or in other words, a coping mechanism. Children start to believe that they need to follow the rules and be a good girl/boy, because if they don’t, they would disrupt everything in their environment, and therefore, it was their responsibility to ‘keep it together’.What a tall order.What I ‘learned’ is that I must do everything in my power to keep the order, to prevent the adults from freaking out, to prevent being grounded. As an adult, this developed a belief that, if I go toward what I desire (or break cultural rules), I will be punished. How do I avoid this so-called punishment? I try to control everything — things that are in my control and things that are not. (The illusion is that I think I can control everything). I’ve become accustomed to thinking that everything needs to be a certain way in order for me to feel safe and good about myself. There is a complete lack of trust in life and the unknown. There is very little room for risk-taking.Therefore I feel like I can conclude that for me personally, not manifesting my desires is my subconscious attempt at survival. I always thought I was living my best life, but when I reflect back on what living has looked like for me, it was merely survival, since I was too afraid to go after what I truly desired, in fear of punishment.How does such a person go in the direction of their dreams? How does someone manifest that which they want for themselves? They don’t. It doesn’t feel safe. It is better to manifest that which others approve of, leading to manifesting what is accepted culturally or socially, or even literally manifesting for others (making sure others are okay first, attending to their needs before your own).A perfectionist in the makingFor example, I have realized with my OCPD that I need to feel accomplished. As such, it is rare for me to take a day off and not check something off my list. I would consider that a waste of a day. I was so obsessed with efficiency that I would schedule activities weeks in advance, my calendar would be so detailed and planned out, there was no possibility to deviate from it. If everything is to be done from a place of accomplishment and the need to check off boxes, it would make sense that my life revolves around work. One way I centered my life around work was by living close to the office so that my commute would be short, so that I could maximize my day, so that I would have time after work to go to more places faster. Do you see the control? The thought of getting a dog was so overwhelming because it would throw a wrench in my calendar. The thought of jeopardizing my efficiency would send me into a panic. I would feel completely trapped by this mental narrative.OCPD has a positive side (there are two sides to any coin). It can make you productive, motivated, and efficient (a trait that’s extremely valuable at work). Individuals with OCPD are detail-oriented, take initiative, are reliable, loyal, and responsible. They think of the worst-case scenario all the time and then plan for it. It can make them an invaluable asset to a business and their boss.So, the point here is not to try to eliminate the OCPD or pretend it is not there. The alternative is to first understand where it comes from, and then to embrace where it can add value to my life, instead of letting it control me. Big difference. So instead of eliminating something that will likely never go away, I want to be able to pinpoint how it has had a negative effect on my life; how it has created a story and an illusion that I’m living and thriving, when I’m really not. The idea is to challenge the story created by OCPD in order to extend trust in life, the universe, whatever you want to call it. Stepping out of the confines of my made-up schedule and need to control outcomes can actually lead to better, unimaginable outcomes. With OCPD, you only know what you know, and you don’t even try to know what you don’t know. That is not a life well-lived.How do I catch myself now? When I start to spiral I ask myself a number of questions, such as:Am I controlling the outcome here?How am I being inflexible and what is it I am trying to protect myself from?Am I rescuing someone else? Why?Am I impressing someone else, or seeking to be validated?Am I making up chaos (story) in my head?These days I am trying to challenge my OCPD and the story it has created by consciously throwing a wrench in my schedule. And trying to move further away from downtown to escape that ‘go go go’ mentality. My OCPD will always be there, but with this newfound awareness, I want to consciously direct it in ways where it will be useful, and challenge it when it is not.Have you ever tried to identify what could be a mental health issue for you?

Mental Illness and Abuse. How Living Through It Can Make You Stronger,https://medium.com/@joannharris-53598/mental-illness-and-abuse-how-living-through-it-can-make-you-stronger-279ad060776c?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Addiction,Mentall Illness,Abuse,Emotional Abuse,Money","If you live or have lived with someone who had/has mental illness resulting in abuse to you I have a few insights from the pain I endured at the time that was happening to me.Somehow I always knew it would not last forever. I knew at some point it would be over one way or another. It took many years to accomplish this but it did end.His was acting wild, erratic, hyper-emotional, unstable, abusive, which resulted in being more of an alcoholic than I had ever scene. He would say he was going out for smokes and never return. The first time he did this it put me in panic mode. I called everyone of his friends to see if he was with them. Then it all bounced back on me as I asked myself if I had done something to cause this as I had never had such a thing happen to me before. We had only known each other a year or so and it never came up.He would finally come back the next day without any explanation. I asked him about what happened trying to get some understanding, but he didn’t feel he needed to explain. “Don’t bust my balls about it!” I left him alone.MENTAL ILLNESSIt all started for me about four to six years or so before my twin boys were born in another country. They are now twenty-five and doing well. Their Dad committed suicide from having schizo-effective disorder and being on so many psychiatric drugs so he could function. He felt that as well.In the end he fell and didn’t get treatment immediately. He was obnoxious, angry, and wouldn’t let anyone help him. He went to a doctor but lied about all the medications he was on. The doctor prescribed Morphine for his pain.DEATHThis was a grave mistake because my husband had an addictive nature. He also had been a drug addict in his early life, so he ultimately took an overdose on purpose. His boys were eleven.It is really a difficult to impossible feat to tell your children that their Dad killed himself.That was a very unusual day. We were divorced at the time and he was living with his brother. Their cousin was helping them move into an apartment a few days earlier. I got a call at work from the cousin just panicked to find her cousin, my ex, dead in bed. She had gone over to check on him and to bring more belongings.She kept asking, “What do I do?, What do I do?” I just told her to call the police to report it and I would be over presently.I assumed he felt he was wasting his life, so why not. It would be better for himself and everyone involved. He just gave up. He had nothing to live for in the state the drugs put him in and he could not live without them. He was supposed to go to psychotherapy but never wanted to do that.By the time I got there the police were there along with the Medical Examiner taking note of the scene. They found him dead and had fallen asleep with a cigarette hanging over an ashtray burned to the nub which was how he went to sleep. He smoked like a chimney. An addiction he had since he was a teen among other things. The Medical Examiner saw all the vials of drugs that he had been prescribed and just shook her head.His brother and cousin were in the living room really upset and crying, etc. His brother saying, “If I had only . . . .” I told him not to do that as his brother didn’t want any help and couldn’t let anyone do anything for him. He was stubborn like that.I did not cry. I was relieved of this burden in my life. I felt free, finally.After a bit he was wheeled out. They put up a sheet so no one could see him in his final state. I did not cry. I was relieved of this burden in my life. I felt free, finally.PAINI went back to work to check on things so I could leave for the day. I had to tell my children what happened.One of them had called the office complaining of being sick to his stomach. I went to the school and picked him up but left the other to finish out his day. No reason really to bring this to his attention before I was ready.I told the son that I had picked up from school what had happened that day after we got home. He was very upset and cried and I held him. He said he felt better after that. Then he went to take a nap.I waited for the other son to come home from school on the bus and then told him what happened. He was in the middle of gaming, sniffed a minute and went on playing. I thought that was not good but I thought it was better to wait for him to ask any questions then to cause more pain.They both knew how their Dad was being through multiple psychotic episodes that just resulted in him going to the VA to get his medications adjusted and staying for a few weeks until he calmed down. He had also scared them a few times and I was afraid he would eventually hurt them.A week or so later we had a small service with only a few people showing up. He had previously ostracized himself from his family, cousins, aunts, uncles, etc. because of his bad behavior that they had to endure most of their whole life. His Mom and Dad had passed away prior to this.The children released balloons and said goodbye. His brother and cousin took care of the burial. We didn’t go to the funeral either. I was too damned angry at him and I didn’t want the boys to have to go through whatever all that would have come to.LESSONS LEARNEDGod, Life, the Universe puts you here on Earth to teach you lessons so you can get more out of life.The StageEighteen years of marriage.Mental instability.Psychotic episodes.AngerAbuse — financially, mentally, emotionally and threats of physical violence.HomelessnessMove to another country out of group agreement.Twin boysMissing in Florida.Alcohol and drugsPrescription psychotic drugsIsolationYou can read more about this here.The Narcissist and the LadyKeep It All A Secretmedium.comWhat I have learned so far:Mental Strength — I learned to rely on myself and to find stability in my life by getting sanity back.For years I did not want to think for myself. I wanted him to think for me and create our life. For a long time he acted as if he could. When many setbacks occurred he went into a deep depression and started sleeping all day, every day.When that started I did not have the mental cohesiveness to cope and organize. I also did not have the financial independence to make our life better in the down times.My Voice — I learned to have a voice.I was always shy and afraid of everything. I was always second guessing myself and being very introverted. I was a very quiet person. I still am but in a different way. I found that if I didn’t speak up for what I wanted I would never get out, ever get it, and things would never get better.Wisdom — I learned a lot about a lot of things.I am glad that I was forty-four when I had the twins. He threatened to harm them more than once inside and outside the womb.If I had been younger I don’t think I could have cared for them and kept them safe as I was a follower instead of a leader. I was also extremely self-centered. You can’t be any of that when you have babies or baby.I also learned that if someone tells you who they are believe them. This was mentioned by Maya Angelo, the wisest person and the most beautiful teacher of the world. Very sad she is gone now but her books and sayings will live forever.I didn’t believe him when he told me he used to be a drug dealer, carried a gun, and spent 28 months in prison. I just didn’t believe him. It was too much for my poor, sheltered, inexperienced mind to comprehend. I know better now.Do Not Isolate Yourself — Stay connected to your family, friends, church members, communities. You can’t do anything all by yourself. Others can help and usually are willing.When we moved to Costa Rica and he said I did not need to know the language to live there, I believed him. That was wrong, just wrong.Costa Rica is a Spanish speaking country. My husband lived in Italy as a child so he was familiar with the Italian language and Spanish are similar.It would have been smart of me to have learned some Spanish before going there. I was willing but he shut me off to everyone. When we moved there people would come over and drink or party and I was left alone in another room or looked at funny. As if I was odd. I was also the one to furnish and clean up after these visitors both American and Costa Rican. No one was interested in me or how I felt about anything. He totally ridiculed me to others behind my back.We did not have a phone to call the USA. We did not have a television to enjoy some entertainment. I had no friends or if I did he ran them off with his destructive actions. He would be so obnoxious and angry when he drank that they did not want to come around again.It was like living in a bubble. You heard sounds but no meaning. This went on for a year. Remember Charlie Brown when adults talked, it was “wha, wha, wha, wha.” Same with me because I did not know Spanish.I also felt emotionally frozen, mentally flat, and alone.When I got pregnant I did find a doctor who spoke English. He was very kind and I liked him a lot but he never thought I was having twins. He was a General Practitioner/Family doctor. He was not the one that did the sonogram where we only saw one baby. But still I was bigger than a mother having one child should be. He should have thought differently or referred me to someone else.We all went out to eat a few times but my husband always took over the conversation and monopolized our fun. He drank and became obnoxious and disrespectful to a lot of people. I think the doctor didn’t like him either. The doctor also never came to the birth or to the hospital later. That’s probably why.Money — Don’t abuse it.We suffered a lot over those years. He worked for himself so sometimes there was a lot of money, sometimes there wasn’t. I worked as office support most of the time which is okay pay but not enough when there is an emergency. Even when you can’t pay bills or buy food that’s stressful.I did not have much earning power then and sometimes he would just not work. He slept a lot. I suppose he always suffered from depression and I did not know it. I thought it was just being lazy.I could not make my own decisions about money either until after he was gone. That was a huge freedom I had. I knew how to budget, pay bills, etc. but I did not know how to deal with no money and you still had to pay bills and such. It was extremely stressful.Abusive behavior when money is concerned is just wrong. He was an alcoholic and would go to bars and burn $100 dollar bills while people watched. Money we could have used for whatever. What made him act like that? Hard to say.Now I have earning power, and was the breadwinner for a long time. Retirement has put a stick in that but I still am the one that pays the bills and buys the food. I can make my own decisions where money is concerned as well.Other thoughtsI still have some issues when it comes to people, trust, love, other people’s motivations, etc. I suppose therapy could help.I am in a relationship now after twelve years with no one. I just don’t want anything to go badly. We have the freedom to be each other. No one tries to change the other. We just root for each other. We help each other and enjoy each other’s company. We care for each other and we are respectful to each other. It’s going on three years and I hope it lasts for awhile.That was what was missing a long time ago.Respect! It is very important.FinallyOne take-away from this would be to never give in to loneliness, isolation, defeat, ridicule, stress, anxiety or to threats.Keep in your mind that it will be over one day and you will have your freedom again. You will come out stronger as well.Jo Ann Harris is an author, parent, book devotee, writer, copywriter, and film fanatic. She is an autodidact who learns about everything and rows her own boat.

Mental Health Series,https://medium.com/@elizpellokila/mental-health-series-1034748a5c8a?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"Desperate,Mentall Illness,Mental Health,Depression,Mental Health Awareness","Chapter 1: DesperateHaving lost all hope.Feeling, showing, or involving a hopeless sense that a situation is so bad as to be impossible to deal with.Don’t you realize that everything that looks okay is not always “okay”? There are a lot of people who struggles and suffers in so many problems in their life.I’ve been in this situation lately. The world always seems against you. You lose all your hope, trust, and feel like a failure. I think that I’m a complete failure and worthless.Desperate is different from depression. Nevertheless, desperate can cause depression. A lot of things can cause depression or then will end up with mental illness. And there is also a lot of stuff that strong desperate up.In particular, like my friend’s said. Failure is relative. And so desperate — or, in this case, losing hope. The crash that I’ve been experiencing lately really drives me to depression. It isn’t straightforward when you lose your faith and give up on everything that you’ve manifested for it.Why do people get so desperate?A lot of people desperate because they can’t get what they’ve planned, frantic because they can’t revenge with a thing that will make their enemies mum, desperately seeking validation, or desperate because they were left by their loved one and so many more.Desperate is not only a condition when you want to hurt yourself or either kill yourself. It can also make someone want to harm others to express their hurts.How to deal with it?Like I’ve stated, desperate is different from depression. When you’re depressed, you lack energy, and thus you’re fatigued, resulting in some physical ailments like digestive problems, body ache, loss of appetite, etc. Like you feel you can’t do something because you know you’ll fail.But when you’re desperate, you’re loaded with energy to accomplish the task or get the work done. Also, you’re prepared to go to any extent by taking all sorts of risks — which what I’ve done recently. I still have so much ambition in myself self, but the world is not on my side, so I failed, and I’m losing my hope. Yet, when I fall, it will hit me so hard because it seems I’ve drained so much energy and time to achieve what I want.The best way to cope with desperate is to break for a while. Break, but don’t stop. You are just facing the bitterness of life, so you have to reflects what the world or God wants you to be.I needed somewhere to cry and not feel so alone, been going through a lot for a long time. I think for all of you, and I’m so sorry we’re all going through these feelings. It’s okay. For the right thoughts are not always your thoughts, neither are your ways my waysThe thing is, those of us who are drowning and cope with depression because of desperate might not realize it. Feel like a failure is okay. But, don’t forget to recover and stand up better. Those of us who are unspeakably ill might not even know that such an illness exists. Always mark in your mind that some mental illness isn’t something to be ashamed of.It’s okay to be sad. It’s okay to feel blue. I’m here to listen to all your miseries.Written byEliz PellokilaShe loves random and bizarre things.

N/A,https://medium.com/@Molly8/decompensation-e883858d1d06?source=tag_archive---------5-----------------------,"Prison Reform,Mentall Illness,Corrections,Frontline","Decompensation:How The Asylums of Last Resort are Failing Our Most Vulnerable PopulationsMolly HuffColorado Mesa UniversityDecompensation, by Todd (Hyung-Rae) Tarselli, a mentally ill prisoner in a super-maximum Pennsylvania facilityThe SummaryEssentially, this documentary was a representative example of the mental health crisis in America today; while Ohio and its correctional system specifically was the focus of the film, these scenarios and stories could have been from any prison — any state — in our country. The film estimated that there are approximately ten times as many mentally ill individuals incarcerated in America as there are mentally ill people in mental health treatment facilities and environments, a statistic that is backed up by the Torrey et. al. statewide study conducted in 2014 in Virginia; our textbook cites various studies that claim a range from less than a quarter to almost half of all US inmates “had a mental health problem” (Erickson & Erickson, 2008). Whatever the true number, it would seem that a system already overcapacity is also under the added and considerable burden of housing and dealing with the majority of the nation’s mentally ill.Because prisons and jails are not designed, staffed, or organized with mental health or treatment in mind, the hundreds of thousands of individuals with mental illnesses who find themselves incarcerated every year face an almost inevitable path of infractions, segregation, longer sentences, and the total collapse of any coping skills they may have had up until that point, also known as decompensation. Essentially, because “the prison does not exist to provide mental health treatment,” but rather to provide “safety and security to the community,” behavior that is symptomatic of the individual’s mental illness will inevitably be seen as disciplinary misconduct and treated accordingly by a staff that is prepped to quell violence and disruption harshly and unanimously (Navasky & O’Connor, 2005). To be specific, the disruptive behavior that is often a direct result of their mental illness and anguish results in extended stays in segregation and near-constant visits from extraction teams, the SWAT teams of the incarceration world who wear riot gear and bum-rush these individuals into brute submission. A life spent largely in solitary confinement with only delusions and psychotic episodes for company, punctuated by the occasional extraction visit, all but ensures that, as pointed out by the film, those who enter incarceration mentally ill invariably get worse and those who enter mentally normative invariably become to some degree mentally ill. Indeed, a federal judge stated in the opinion written after Madrid v. Gomez that placing these vulnerable inmates into solitary confinement “is the mental equivalent of putting an asthmatic in a place with little air to breathe” (Haney, 2017).Cause of the IssueDeinstitutionalization is inarguably the root cause of our prisons and jails becoming the de facto mental health solution of the United States. One thing that is crucial to understanding many themes and trends within the criminal justice history of the United States is the historical tendency for our policies and practices to swing from one end of the pendulum (the crime-control model, in which public safety is the number one priority) to the other (due process, wherein concern for the constitutional rights of individuals brought before the state take precedence). Indeed, it was the accepted practice to house the mentally ill in jails and prisons for the beginning of our nation’s history — just as we do today — until the nineteenth century, when the switch was made to the state-run hospitals and asylums that quickly became overrun and understaffed. In turn, this became the norm until the aforementioned deinstitutionalization of the mid-twentieth century (Torrey et. al., 2016). While many people would perhaps be quick to assume that the mass closure and downsizing of most state mental hospitals in America was the result of callous financial and political games, it was actually an empathetic and compassionate (if not short-sighted) response to what had become atrocious conditions and overcrowding, leaving the country’s most vulnerable in deplorable conditions. The well-intentioned idea was that the warehousing of mentally ill people in these asylums would be replaced by intimate and personalized community treatment, wherein society would take care of their own from the bottom up. While this is the ideal solution, the doors of state mental hospitals were closed en masse with very little of the necessary community infrastructure in place or even the ability to do so. The results were predictable, in hindsight: an exodus of people with very little social support or coping skills to the streets and underpasses of America.Simultaneously, the pendulum of the American criminal justice system has been swinging inexorably back towards the crime-control model ever since the civil rights era, meaning that the socially unacceptable or even frightening or bewildering behavior displayed by a mentally ill and homeless person going about their day began to be routinely greeted with arrest and incarceration. Haney speaks to the “decontextualization of criminality, which has greatly expanded the reach of the criminal justice system and removed consideration of social factors…from the sentencing calculus”; the routine arrest of people who are at worst in a state of psychosis is the culmination of this trend.Whereas the index crimes for the vast majority of the incarcerated mentally ill in America are nonviolent and extremely minor, upon incarceration their behavior is naturally exacerbated and worsened by the environment itself, which has marked effects on even the correctional officers and administrative staff who get to leave at the end of the workday. The fear and violence of the prison environment is almost entirely antithetical to the one in which mentally ill individuals should be. One inmate filmed for the documentary perfectly illustrated the results of what Haney termed an “ecology of cruelty”: Carl McEachron, sent to prison for a crime that carried with it a maximum sentence of 3 years, had spent 16 years in prison at the time of filming due to infractions and violations directly related to his mental illness (Haney, 2017; Navasky & O’Connor, 2005).Solutions to the IssueWhile a feasible solution may appear too daunting to consider, there is a welcome and encouraging consensus in the literature regarding how to begin to mediate this public health crisis. For example, almost all professionals even tangentially involved in this problem agree that “individuals with severe mental disorders who are in need of treatment belong in hospitals, not in prisons and jails” (Torrey et. al., 2016). The mass implementation of Crisis Intervention Training across law enforcement agencies, as well as their partnership with Acute Trauma Units and advocacy services, could prevent thousands of arrests and recidivisms every year. Keeping these people in the community and on top of their medication management and well-being makes good fiscal as well as moral sense, not to mention the public safety component. As the director of Ohio’s corrections stated in the documentary, he became not only a prison warden but a mental health director when he accepted the job; no aspect of our current correctional system is prepared for or geared towards this type of massive social responsibility.My Thoughts/Opinions on the FilmI was extremely struck by the footage that this documentary showed from the archives of the prisons themselves: watching mentally disturbed and possibly psychotic inmates get tactically and brutally subdued by men in masks and riot gear and dragged out of the tiny cells in which they spend their entire lives gave me a chilling sense of perspective into the type of horrifying reality these individuals live in when they are left in a cell without adequate treatment or medication. Our textbook decried the asylums and hospitals that prisons replaced, where “hoods were placed on patients’ heads in an effort to quiet their minds” (Erickson & Erickson, 2008). This film did an excellent job of showing just how far contemporary prisons have gone in their efforts to fill their predecessor’s shoes.CitationsErickson, P. E., & Erickson, S. K. (2008).

Recognizing Emerging Mental Illness,https://medium.com/@kartardiamond/recognizing-emerging-mental-illness-e6effce5cab7?source=tag_archive---------6-----------------------,"Mentall Illness,Misdiagnosis,Self Medicating,Drug Use","Photo by MaximoRecognizing mental illness when it first emerges can be extremely difficult, even for family members who are so familiar with the personality and character of their suffering loved one. This can be an agonizing and fear-inducing predicament for obvious reasons. What makes the recognition of mental illness so challenging can be blamed on several factors.Firstly, the average person is not expected to be educated about mental illness, unless they already have someone in their life with a well-established mental illness. Some cultures make people extraordinarily uncomfortable with even speculating that a family member could be ill and they procrastinate in seeking out professional help or even discussing it privately. Because there is a lot of stigma associated with mental illnesses, both the sufferer and their family may want to assume anything else could be going on besides a diagnosis which can alter a person’s life forever and profoundly.When mental illness first manifests, if the person experiencing it is young, like a teenager, their odd behaviors and symptoms could be hastily written off as the result of teenage hormones. Young males especially can engage in risky, aggressive, or manic behaviors that are misinterpreted precisely because of their youth and immaturity.Because of the prevalence of drug abuse in our society, it’s also a common reflexive response for family members to think that their ill child or sibling may be acting strange and unpredictable because they are under the influence of drugs or alcohol. In fact, even when we suspect that a person may have psychological issues, we still consider the possibility that their most disturbing symptoms could be caused by self-medicating with drugs. During one of my own son’s longer hospitalizations, I was stunned to find out he was not under the influence of street drugs when he committed some very anti-social behaviors.Another reason why it is so hard to recognize emerging mental illness is because some people are actually fairly good at hiding it for a while, intentionally or not. Parents are often told to notice if their child suddenly withdraws from their friends, starts doing poorly in school, or seems to have a sudden personality shift. These are important clues, but some kids or young adults can still pretend they are doing fine when they are not, until something really dramatic or explosive happens, taking everyone by surprise.We also need to separate out what may be defined clinically as a personality disorder or a mood disorder, compared with full-blown serious mental illness. For example, anxiety can be very concerning and debilitating. Some behaviors associated with anxiety can even reveal and underlying psychotic process. But there is a world of difference between general anxiety disorder and schizophrenia.There are clinical descriptions of what constitutes a mental illness, but some of those behaviors and symptoms need to occur continuously over at least a six month period of time before it can be confirmed. It is also very common for diagnoses to change as more and different symptoms emerge. Psychiatrists do their best to be accurate, but they do not have any type of physical examination to determine a mental disorder. In fact, sometimes they can only come to conclusions based on what the mentally ill person admits to them. When a person with a thought disorder relays their own symptoms, their perceptions and memories could be far from accurate or objective. Further, it is also common for people to have a co-occurring diagnosis. For example, a person may have both anxiety and depression. A person diagnosed with both schizophrenia and a mood disorder is referred to as schizoaffective disorder. The term “dual diagnosis” now implies a mental illness along with a substance abuse disorder.Some medications address targeted issues, but with a misdiagnosis the side effects can be substantial. For instance, if a person initially acts depressed, they may be prescribed an anti-depressant. If the person actually has bipolar disorder, the anti-depressant could propel the person into a manic episode. Most of us have heard the commercials on TV with the long list of scary side-effects from medications. The wrong prescription could increase a person’s symptoms or cause completely different ones, including suicidal ideation.Roughly 20% of the general population will experience some form of psychological stress at points in their life which is significant enough to warrant professional help. Being depressed over genuinely stressful life events like divorce or job loss will eventually subside when circumstances improve and when temporary therapy or other treatments are utilized. Serious mental illness, however, needs to be managed for a life time, often with unsatisfactory results.One thing for sure is that the more we openly discuss mental illness, the less stigmatized it will become. In turn, more people will seek out treatment sooner and compliance to medication or therapy will also be more successful.Written byKartar DiamondFeng Shui consultant, author & teacher since 1992. www.FengShuiSolutions.net I also write about other metaphysical topics and mental health advocacy.Follow1 1 1 Mentall IllnessMisdiagnosisSelf MedicatingDrug UseMore from Kartar DiamondFollowFeng Shui consultant, author & teacher since 1992. www.FengShuiSolutions.net I also write about other metaphysical topics and mental health advocacy.More From MediumWhy Disconnecting Made Me Feel More ConnectedEvan McCoy in Invisible IllnessWhen Everyone Thinks You’re Overreacting, But You’re NotRuss W in Invisible IllnessThe Underestimated Ways Depression Can Enrich Your LifeCarine Ru in Invisible IllnessDoes My Inflamed Brain Make Me Suicidal?Toni Tails in SURVIVORSHow Pottery Helped Me Overcome My AnxietyDaniel A in The AscentWhat It’s Like to Know You’ll Be on Antidepressants for LifeDanielle Tcholakian in The Cut10 Quotes to Help You Find Hope During the Coronavirus PandemicCynthia Perkins, M.Ed. in Invisible IllnessAnxiety: How My First Bully Became My Oldest FriendCharlotte Buelow in The AscentAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

I did not suffer from one, nor have I been diagnosed with one. This all changed when a friend, who happens to be a life coach, challenged me to read more about mental disorders. One disorder in particular resonated very closely with my life.What is mental illness anyway? It can be defined as a pattern that causes distress or impairment of personal functioning, affecting how a person behaves, feels, perceives, or thinks. When we think of mental illness we may think of extreme cases where it is preventing a person from living their day to day life. The notion of ‘functioning’ is subjective. Even if you haven’t been diagnosed with a mental disorder, what if there was something lingering in the background, affecting your life in ways that are not as subtle as you think?I immersed myself in research and discovered Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder or OCPD. Health professionals describe it as “a personality disorder characterized by excessive concern with orderliness, perfectionism, attention to details, mental and interpersonal control, and a need for control over one’s environment, which interferes with flexibility, openness to experience.” Developed as a coping mechanism unconsciously in childhood, I now realize it is actually preventing me from manifesting the life I want to live as an adult.My research uncovered that people who have OCPD likely grew up with over-involved and overprotective parents who expected their strict rules to be followed. Disobedience to those rules was followed by punishment and grounding. These children, as a result, learned that in order to survive at home they needed to be perfect. They received praise for ‘being good’. Experts say that this can be labeled as learned behaviour, or in other words, a coping mechanism. Children start to believe that they need to follow the rules and be a good girl/boy, because if they don’t, they would disrupt everything in their environment, and therefore, it was their responsibility to ‘keep it together’.What a tall order.What I ‘learned’ is that I must do everything in my power to keep the order, to prevent the adults from freaking out, to prevent being grounded. As an adult, this developed a belief that, if I go toward what I desire (or break cultural rules), I will be punished. How do I avoid this so-called punishment? I try to control everything — things that are in my control and things that are not. (The illusion is that I think I can control everything). I’ve become accustomed to thinking that everything needs to be a certain way in order for me to feel safe and good about myself. There is a complete lack of trust in life and the unknown. There is very little room for risk-taking.Therefore I feel like I can conclude that for me personally, not manifesting my desires is my subconscious attempt at survival. I always thought I was living my best life, but when I reflect back on what living has looked like for me, it was merely survival, since I was too afraid to go after what I truly desired, in fear of punishment.How does such a person go in the direction of their dreams? How does someone manifest that which they want for themselves? They don’t. It doesn’t feel safe. It is better to manifest that which others approve of, leading to manifesting what is accepted culturally or socially, or even literally manifesting for others (making sure others are okay first, attending to their needs before your own).A perfectionist in the makingFor example, I have realized with my OCPD that I need to feel accomplished. As such, it is rare for me to take a day off and not check something off my list. I would consider that a waste of a day. I was so obsessed with efficiency that I would schedule activities weeks in advance, my calendar would be so detailed and planned out, there was no possibility to deviate from it. If everything is to be done from a place of accomplishment and the need to check off boxes, it would make sense that my life revolves around work. One way I centered my life around work was by living close to the office so that my commute would be short, so that I could maximize my day, so that I would have time after work to go to more places faster. Do you see the control? The thought of getting a dog was so overwhelming because it would throw a wrench in my calendar. The thought of jeopardizing my efficiency would send me into a panic. I would feel completely trapped by this mental narrative.OCPD has a positive side (there are two sides to any coin). It can make you productive, motivated, and efficient (a trait that’s extremely valuable at work). Individuals with OCPD are detail-oriented, take initiative, are reliable, loyal, and responsible. They think of the worst-case scenario all the time and then plan for it. It can make them an invaluable asset to a business and their boss.So, the point here is not to try to eliminate the OCPD or pretend it is not there. The alternative is to first understand where it comes from, and then to embrace where it can add value to my life, instead of letting it control me. Big difference. So instead of eliminating something that will likely never go away, I want to be able to pinpoint how it has had a negative effect on my life; how it has created a story and an illusion that I’m living and thriving, when I’m really not. The idea is to challenge the story created by OCPD in order to extend trust in life, the universe, whatever you want to call it. Stepping out of the confines of my made-up schedule and need to control outcomes can actually lead to better, unimaginable outcomes. With OCPD, you only know what you know, and you don’t even try to know what you don’t know. That is not a life well-lived.How do I catch myself now? When I start to spiral I ask myself a number of questions, such as:Am I controlling the outcome here?How am I being inflexible and what is it I am trying to protect myself from?Am I rescuing someone else? Why?Am I impressing someone else, or seeking to be validated?Am I making up chaos (story) in my head?These days I am trying to challenge my OCPD and the story it has created by consciously throwing a wrench in my schedule. And trying to move further away from downtown to escape that ‘go go go’ mentality. My OCPD will always be there, but with this newfound awareness, I want to consciously direct it in ways where it will be useful, and challenge it when it is not.Have you ever tried to identify what could be a mental health issue for you?

Mental Illness and Abuse. How Living Through It Can Make You Stronger,https://medium.com/@joannharris-53598/mental-illness-and-abuse-how-living-through-it-can-make-you-stronger-279ad060776c?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Addiction,Mentall Illness,Abuse,Emotional Abuse,Money","If you live or have lived with someone who had/has mental illness resulting in abuse to you I have a few insights from the pain I endured at the time that was happening to me.Somehow I always knew it would not last forever. I knew at some point it would be over one way or another. It took many years to accomplish this but it did end.His was acting wild, erratic, hyper-emotional, unstable, abusive, which resulted in being more of an alcoholic than I had ever scene. He would say he was going out for smokes and never return. The first time he did this it put me in panic mode. I called everyone of his friends to see if he was with them. Then it all bounced back on me as I asked myself if I had done something to cause this as I had never had such a thing happen to me before. We had only known each other a year or so and it never came up.He would finally come back the next day without any explanation. I asked him about what happened trying to get some understanding, but he didn’t feel he needed to explain. “Don’t bust my balls about it!” I left him alone.MENTAL ILLNESSIt all started for me about four to six years or so before my twin boys were born in another country. They are now twenty-five and doing well. Their Dad committed suicide from having schizo-effective disorder and being on so many psychiatric drugs so he could function. He felt that as well.In the end he fell and didn’t get treatment immediately. He was obnoxious, angry, and wouldn’t let anyone help him. He went to a doctor but lied about all the medications he was on. The doctor prescribed Morphine for his pain.DEATHThis was a grave mistake because my husband had an addictive nature. He also had been a drug addict in his early life, so he ultimately took an overdose on purpose. His boys were eleven.It is really a difficult to impossible feat to tell your children that their Dad killed himself.That was a very unusual day. We were divorced at the time and he was living with his brother. Their cousin was helping them move into an apartment a few days earlier. I got a call at work from the cousin just panicked to find her cousin, my ex, dead in bed. She had gone over to check on him and to bring more belongings.She kept asking, “What do I do?, What do I do?” I just told her to call the police to report it and I would be over presently.I assumed he felt he was wasting his life, so why not. It would be better for himself and everyone involved. He just gave up. He had nothing to live for in the state the drugs put him in and he could not live without them. He was supposed to go to psychotherapy but never wanted to do that.By the time I got there the police were there along with the Medical Examiner taking note of the scene. They found him dead and had fallen asleep with a cigarette hanging over an ashtray burned to the nub which was how he went to sleep. He smoked like a chimney. An addiction he had since he was a teen among other things. The Medical Examiner saw all the vials of drugs that he had been prescribed and just shook her head.His brother and cousin were in the living room really upset and crying, etc. His brother saying, “If I had only . . . .” I told him not to do that as his brother didn’t want any help and couldn’t let anyone do anything for him. He was stubborn like that.I did not cry. I was relieved of this burden in my life. I felt free, finally.After a bit he was wheeled out. They put up a sheet so no one could see him in his final state. I did not cry. I was relieved of this burden in my life. I felt free, finally.PAINI went back to work to check on things so I could leave for the day. I had to tell my children what happened.One of them had called the office complaining of being sick to his stomach. I went to the school and picked him up but left the other to finish out his day. No reason really to bring this to his attention before I was ready.I told the son that I had picked up from school what had happened that day after we got home. He was very upset and cried and I held him. He said he felt better after that. Then he went to take a nap.I waited for the other son to come home from school on the bus and then told him what happened. He was in the middle of gaming, sniffed a minute and went on playing. I thought that was not good but I thought it was better to wait for him to ask any questions then to cause more pain.They both knew how their Dad was being through multiple psychotic episodes that just resulted in him going to the VA to get his medications adjusted and staying for a few weeks until he calmed down. He had also scared them a few times and I was afraid he would eventually hurt them.A week or so later we had a small service with only a few people showing up. He had previously ostracized himself from his family, cousins, aunts, uncles, etc. because of his bad behavior that they had to endure most of their whole life. His Mom and Dad had passed away prior to this.The children released balloons and said goodbye. His brother and cousin took care of the burial. We didn’t go to the funeral either. I was too damned angry at him and I didn’t want the boys to have to go through whatever all that would have come to.LESSONS LEARNEDGod, Life, the Universe puts you here on Earth to teach you lessons so you can get more out of life.The StageEighteen years of marriage.Mental instability.Psychotic episodes.AngerAbuse — financially, mentally, emotionally and threats of physical violence.HomelessnessMove to another country out of group agreement.Twin boysMissing in Florida.Alcohol and drugsPrescription psychotic drugsIsolationYou can read more about this here.The Narcissist and the LadyKeep It All A Secretmedium.comWhat I have learned so far:Mental Strength — I learned to rely on myself and to find stability in my life by getting sanity back.For years I did not want to think for myself. I wanted him to think for me and create our life. For a long time he acted as if he could. When many setbacks occurred he went into a deep depression and started sleeping all day, every day.When that started I did not have the mental cohesiveness to cope and organize. I also did not have the financial independence to make our life better in the down times.My Voice — I learned to have a voice.I was always shy and afraid of everything. I was always second guessing myself and being very introverted. I was a very quiet person. I still am but in a different way. I found that if I didn’t speak up for what I wanted I would never get out, ever get it, and things would never get better.Wisdom — I learned a lot about a lot of things.I am glad that I was forty-four when I had the twins. He threatened to harm them more than once inside and outside the womb.If I had been younger I don’t think I could have cared for them and kept them safe as I was a follower instead of a leader. I was also extremely self-centered. You can’t be any of that when you have babies or baby.I also learned that if someone tells you who they are believe them. This was mentioned by Maya Angelo, the wisest person and the most beautiful teacher of the world. Very sad she is gone now but her books and sayings will live forever.I didn’t believe him when he told me he used to be a drug dealer, carried a gun, and spent 28 months in prison. I just didn’t believe him. It was too much for my poor, sheltered, inexperienced mind to comprehend. I know better now.Do Not Isolate Yourself — Stay connected to your family, friends, church members, communities. You can’t do anything all by yourself. Others can help and usually are willing.When we moved to Costa Rica and he said I did not need to know the language to live there, I believed him. That was wrong, just wrong.Costa Rica is a Spanish speaking country. My husband lived in Italy as a child so he was familiar with the Italian language and Spanish are similar.It would have been smart of me to have learned some Spanish before going there. I was willing but he shut me off to everyone. When we moved there people would come over and drink or party and I was left alone in another room or looked at funny. As if I was odd. I was also the one to furnish and clean up after these visitors both American and Costa Rican. No one was interested in me or how I felt about anything. He totally ridiculed me to others behind my back.We did not have a phone to call the USA. We did not have a television to enjoy some entertainment. I had no friends or if I did he ran them off with his destructive actions. He would be so obnoxious and angry when he drank that they did not want to come around again.It was like living in a bubble. You heard sounds but no meaning. This went on for a year. Remember Charlie Brown when adults talked, it was “wha, wha, wha, wha.” Same with me because I did not know Spanish.I also felt emotionally frozen, mentally flat, and alone.When I got pregnant I did find a doctor who spoke English. He was very kind and I liked him a lot but he never thought I was having twins. He was a General Practitioner/Family doctor. He was not the one that did the sonogram where we only saw one baby. But still I was bigger than a mother having one child should be. He should have thought differently or referred me to someone else.We all went out to eat a few times but my husband always took over the conversation and monopolized our fun. He drank and became obnoxious and disrespectful to a lot of people. I think the doctor didn’t like him either. The doctor also never came to the birth or to the hospital later. That’s probably why.Money — Don’t abuse it.We suffered a lot over those years. He worked for himself so sometimes there was a lot of money, sometimes there wasn’t. I worked as office support most of the time which is okay pay but not enough when there is an emergency. Even when you can’t pay bills or buy food that’s stressful.I did not have much earning power then and sometimes he would just not work. He slept a lot. I suppose he always suffered from depression and I did not know it. I thought it was just being lazy.I could not make my own decisions about money either until after he was gone. That was a huge freedom I had. I knew how to budget, pay bills, etc. but I did not know how to deal with no money and you still had to pay bills and such. It was extremely stressful.Abusive behavior when money is concerned is just wrong. He was an alcoholic and would go to bars and burn $100 dollar bills while people watched. Money we could have used for whatever. What made him act like that? Hard to say.Now I have earning power, and was the breadwinner for a long time. Retirement has put a stick in that but I still am the one that pays the bills and buys the food. I can make my own decisions where money is concerned as well.Other thoughtsI still have some issues when it comes to people, trust, love, other people’s motivations, etc. I suppose therapy could help.I am in a relationship now after twelve years with no one. I just don’t want anything to go badly. We have the freedom to be each other. No one tries to change the other. We just root for each other. We help each other and enjoy each other’s company. We care for each other and we are respectful to each other. It’s going on three years and I hope it lasts for awhile.That was what was missing a long time ago.Respect! It is very important.FinallyOne take-away from this would be to never give in to loneliness, isolation, defeat, ridicule, stress, anxiety or to threats.Keep in your mind that it will be over one day and you will have your freedom again. You will come out stronger as well.Jo Ann Harris is an author, parent, book devotee, writer, copywriter, and film fanatic. She is an autodidact who learns about everything and rows her own boat.

Mental Health Series,https://medium.com/@elizpellokila/mental-health-series-1034748a5c8a?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"Desperate,Mentall Illness,Mental Health,Depression,Mental Health Awareness","Chapter 1: DesperateHaving lost all hope.Feeling, showing, or involving a hopeless sense that a situation is so bad as to be impossible to deal with.Don’t you realize that everything that looks okay is not always “okay”? There are a lot of people who struggles and suffers in so many problems in their life.I’ve been in this situation lately. The world always seems against you. You lose all your hope, trust, and feel like a failure. I think that I’m a complete failure and worthless.Desperate is different from depression. Nevertheless, desperate can cause depression. A lot of things can cause depression or then will end up with mental illness. And there is also a lot of stuff that strong desperate up.In particular, like my friend’s said. Failure is relative. And so desperate — or, in this case, losing hope. The crash that I’ve been experiencing lately really drives me to depression. It isn’t straightforward when you lose your faith and give up on everything that you’ve manifested for it.Why do people get so desperate?A lot of people desperate because they can’t get what they’ve planned, frantic because they can’t revenge with a thing that will make their enemies mum, desperately seeking validation, or desperate because they were left by their loved one and so many more.Desperate is not only a condition when you want to hurt yourself or either kill yourself. It can also make someone want to harm others to express their hurts.How to deal with it?Like I’ve stated, desperate is different from depression. When you’re depressed, you lack energy, and thus you’re fatigued, resulting in some physical ailments like digestive problems, body ache, loss of appetite, etc. Like you feel you can’t do something because you know you’ll fail.But when you’re desperate, you’re loaded with energy to accomplish the task or get the work done. Also, you’re prepared to go to any extent by taking all sorts of risks — which what I’ve done recently. I still have so much ambition in myself self, but the world is not on my side, so I failed, and I’m losing my hope. Yet, when I fall, it will hit me so hard because it seems I’ve drained so much energy and time to achieve what I want.The best way to cope with desperate is to break for a while. Break, but don’t stop. You are just facing the bitterness of life, so you have to reflects what the world or God wants you to be.I needed somewhere to cry and not feel so alone, been going through a lot for a long time. I think for all of you, and I’m so sorry we’re all going through these feelings. It’s okay. For the right thoughts are not always your thoughts, neither are your ways my waysThe thing is, those of us who are drowning and cope with depression because of desperate might not realize it. Feel like a failure is okay. But, don’t forget to recover and stand up better. Those of us who are unspeakably ill might not even know that such an illness exists. Always mark in your mind that some mental illness isn’t something to be ashamed of.It’s okay to be sad. It’s okay to feel blue. I’m here to listen to all your miseries.Written byEliz PellokilaShe loves random and bizarre things.

N/A,https://medium.com/@Molly8/decompensation-e883858d1d06?source=tag_archive---------5-----------------------,"Prison Reform,Mentall Illness,Corrections,Frontline","Decompensation:How The Asylums of Last Resort are Failing Our Most Vulnerable PopulationsMolly HuffColorado Mesa UniversityDecompensation, by Todd (Hyung-Rae) Tarselli, a mentally ill prisoner in a super-maximum Pennsylvania facilityThe SummaryEssentially, this documentary was a representative example of the mental health crisis in America today; while Ohio and its correctional system specifically was the focus of the film, these scenarios and stories could have been from any prison — any state — in our country. The film estimated that there are approximately ten times as many mentally ill individuals incarcerated in America as there are mentally ill people in mental health treatment facilities and environments, a statistic that is backed up by the Torrey et. al. statewide study conducted in 2014 in Virginia; our textbook cites various studies that claim a range from less than a quarter to almost half of all US inmates “had a mental health problem” (Erickson & Erickson, 2008). Whatever the true number, it would seem that a system already overcapacity is also under the added and considerable burden of housing and dealing with the majority of the nation’s mentally ill.Because prisons and jails are not designed, staffed, or organized with mental health or treatment in mind, the hundreds of thousands of individuals with mental illnesses who find themselves incarcerated every year face an almost inevitable path of infractions, segregation, longer sentences, and the total collapse of any coping skills they may have had up until that point, also known as decompensation. Essentially, because “the prison does not exist to provide mental health treatment,” but rather to provide “safety and security to the community,” behavior that is symptomatic of the individual’s mental illness will inevitably be seen as disciplinary misconduct and treated accordingly by a staff that is prepped to quell violence and disruption harshly and unanimously (Navasky & O’Connor, 2005). To be specific, the disruptive behavior that is often a direct result of their mental illness and anguish results in extended stays in segregation and near-constant visits from extraction teams, the SWAT teams of the incarceration world who wear riot gear and bum-rush these individuals into brute submission. A life spent largely in solitary confinement with only delusions and psychotic episodes for company, punctuated by the occasional extraction visit, all but ensures that, as pointed out by the film, those who enter incarceration mentally ill invariably get worse and those who enter mentally normative invariably become to some degree mentally ill. Indeed, a federal judge stated in the opinion written after Madrid v. Gomez that placing these vulnerable inmates into solitary confinement “is the mental equivalent of putting an asthmatic in a place with little air to breathe” (Haney, 2017).Cause of the IssueDeinstitutionalization is inarguably the root cause of our prisons and jails becoming the de facto mental health solution of the United States. One thing that is crucial to understanding many themes and trends within the criminal justice history of the United States is the historical tendency for our policies and practices to swing from one end of the pendulum (the crime-control model, in which public safety is the number one priority) to the other (due process, wherein concern for the constitutional rights of individuals brought before the state take precedence). Indeed, it was the accepted practice to house the mentally ill in jails and prisons for the beginning of our nation’s history — just as we do today — until the nineteenth century, when the switch was made to the state-run hospitals and asylums that quickly became overrun and understaffed. In turn, this became the norm until the aforementioned deinstitutionalization of the mid-twentieth century (Torrey et. al., 2016). While many people would perhaps be quick to assume that the mass closure and downsizing of most state mental hospitals in America was the result of callous financial and political games, it was actually an empathetic and compassionate (if not short-sighted) response to what had become atrocious conditions and overcrowding, leaving the country’s most vulnerable in deplorable conditions. The well-intentioned idea was that the warehousing of mentally ill people in these asylums would be replaced by intimate and personalized community treatment, wherein society would take care of their own from the bottom up. While this is the ideal solution, the doors of state mental hospitals were closed en masse with very little of the necessary community infrastructure in place or even the ability to do so. The results were predictable, in hindsight: an exodus of people with very little social support or coping skills to the streets and underpasses of America.Simultaneously, the pendulum of the American criminal justice system has been swinging inexorably back towards the crime-control model ever since the civil rights era, meaning that the socially unacceptable or even frightening or bewildering behavior displayed by a mentally ill and homeless person going about their day began to be routinely greeted with arrest and incarceration. Haney speaks to the “decontextualization of criminality, which has greatly expanded the reach of the criminal justice system and removed consideration of social factors…from the sentencing calculus”; the routine arrest of people who are at worst in a state of psychosis is the culmination of this trend.Whereas the index crimes for the vast majority of the incarcerated mentally ill in America are nonviolent and extremely minor, upon incarceration their behavior is naturally exacerbated and worsened by the environment itself, which has marked effects on even the correctional officers and administrative staff who get to leave at the end of the workday. The fear and violence of the prison environment is almost entirely antithetical to the one in which mentally ill individuals should be. One inmate filmed for the documentary perfectly illustrated the results of what Haney termed an “ecology of cruelty”: Carl McEachron, sent to prison for a crime that carried with it a maximum sentence of 3 years, had spent 16 years in prison at the time of filming due to infractions and violations directly related to his mental illness (Haney, 2017; Navasky & O’Connor, 2005).Solutions to the IssueWhile a feasible solution may appear too daunting to consider, there is a welcome and encouraging consensus in the literature regarding how to begin to mediate this public health crisis. For example, almost all professionals even tangentially involved in this problem agree that “individuals with severe mental disorders who are in need of treatment belong in hospitals, not in prisons and jails” (Torrey et. al., 2016). The mass implementation of Crisis Intervention Training across law enforcement agencies, as well as their partnership with Acute Trauma Units and advocacy services, could prevent thousands of arrests and recidivisms every year. Keeping these people in the community and on top of their medication management and well-being makes good fiscal as well as moral sense, not to mention the public safety component. As the director of Ohio’s corrections stated in the documentary, he became not only a prison warden but a mental health director when he accepted the job; no aspect of our current correctional system is prepared for or geared towards this type of massive social responsibility.My Thoughts/Opinions on the FilmI was extremely struck by the footage that this documentary showed from the archives of the prisons themselves: watching mentally disturbed and possibly psychotic inmates get tactically and brutally subdued by men in masks and riot gear and dragged out of the tiny cells in which they spend their entire lives gave me a chilling sense of perspective into the type of horrifying reality these individuals live in when they are left in a cell without adequate treatment or medication. Our textbook decried the asylums and hospitals that prisons replaced, where “hoods were placed on patients’ heads in an effort to quiet their minds” (Erickson & Erickson, 2008). This film did an excellent job of showing just how far contemporary prisons have gone in their efforts to fill their predecessor’s shoes.CitationsErickson, P. E., & Erickson, S. K. (2008).

Recognizing Emerging Mental Illness,https://medium.com/@kartardiamond/recognizing-emerging-mental-illness-e6effce5cab7?source=tag_archive---------6-----------------------,"Mentall Illness,Misdiagnosis,Self Medicating,Drug Use","Photo by MaximoRecognizing mental illness when it first emerges can be extremely difficult, even for family members who are so familiar with the personality and character of their suffering loved one. This can be an agonizing and fear-inducing predicament for obvious reasons. What makes the recognition of mental illness so challenging can be blamed on several factors.Firstly, the average person is not expected to be educated about mental illness, unless they already have someone in their life with a well-established mental illness. Some cultures make people extraordinarily uncomfortable with even speculating that a family member could be ill and they procrastinate in seeking out professional help or even discussing it privately. Because there is a lot of stigma associated with mental illnesses, both the sufferer and their family may want to assume anything else could be going on besides a diagnosis which can alter a person’s life forever and profoundly.When mental illness first manifests, if the person experiencing it is young, like a teenager, their odd behaviors and symptoms could be hastily written off as the result of teenage hormones. Young males especially can engage in risky, aggressive, or manic behaviors that are misinterpreted precisely because of their youth and immaturity.Because of the prevalence of drug abuse in our society, it’s also a common reflexive response for family members to think that their ill child or sibling may be acting strange and unpredictable because they are under the influence of drugs or alcohol. In fact, even when we suspect that a person may have psychological issues, we still consider the possibility that their most disturbing symptoms could be caused by self-medicating with drugs. During one of my own son’s longer hospitalizations, I was stunned to find out he was not under the influence of street drugs when he committed some very anti-social behaviors.Another reason why it is so hard to recognize emerging mental illness is because some people are actually fairly good at hiding it for a while, intentionally or not. Parents are often told to notice if their child suddenly withdraws from their friends, starts doing poorly in school, or seems to have a sudden personality shift. These are important clues, but some kids or young adults can still pretend they are doing fine when they are not, until something really dramatic or explosive happens, taking everyone by surprise.We also need to separate out what may be defined clinically as a personality disorder or a mood disorder, compared with full-blown serious mental illness. For example, anxiety can be very concerning and debilitating. Some behaviors associated with anxiety can even reveal and underlying psychotic process. But there is a world of difference between general anxiety disorder and schizophrenia.There are clinical descriptions of what constitutes a mental illness, but some of those behaviors and symptoms need to occur continuously over at least a six month period of time before it can be confirmed. It is also very common for diagnoses to change as more and different symptoms emerge. Psychiatrists do their best to be accurate, but they do not have any type of physical examination to determine a mental disorder. In fact, sometimes they can only come to conclusions based on what the mentally ill person admits to them. When a person with a thought disorder relays their own symptoms, their perceptions and memories could be far from accurate or objective. Further, it is also common for people to have a co-occurring diagnosis. For example, a person may have both anxiety and depression. A person diagnosed with both schizophrenia and a mood disorder is referred to as schizoaffective disorder. The term “dual diagnosis” now implies a mental illness along with a substance abuse disorder.Some medications address targeted issues, but with a misdiagnosis the side effects can be substantial. For instance, if a person initially acts depressed, they may be prescribed an anti-depressant. If the person actually has bipolar disorder, the anti-depressant could propel the person into a manic episode. Most of us have heard the commercials on TV with the long list of scary side-effects from medications. The wrong prescription could increase a person’s symptoms or cause completely different ones, including suicidal ideation.Roughly 20% of the general population will experience some form of psychological stress at points in their life which is significant enough to warrant professional help. Being depressed over genuinely stressful life events like divorce or job loss will eventually subside when circumstances improve and when temporary therapy or other treatments are utilized. Serious mental illness, however, needs to be managed for a life time, often with unsatisfactory results.One thing for sure is that the more we openly discuss mental illness, the less stigmatized it will become. In turn, more people will seek out treatment sooner and compliance to medication or therapy will also be more successful.Written byKartar DiamondFeng Shui consultant, author & teacher since 1992. www.FengShuiSolutions.net I also write about other metaphysical topics and mental health advocacy.Follow1 1 1 Mentall IllnessMisdiagnosisSelf MedicatingDrug UseMore from Kartar DiamondFollowFeng Shui consultant, author & teacher since 1992. www.FengShuiSolutions.net I also write about other metaphysical topics and mental health advocacy.More From MediumWhy Disconnecting Made Me Feel More ConnectedEvan McCoy in Invisible IllnessWhen Everyone Thinks You’re Overreacting, But You’re NotRuss W in Invisible IllnessThe Underestimated Ways Depression Can Enrich Your LifeCarine Ru in Invisible IllnessDoes My Inflamed Brain Make Me Suicidal?Toni Tails in SURVIVORSHow Pottery Helped Me Overcome My AnxietyDaniel A in The AscentWhat It’s Like to Know You’ll Be on Antidepressants for LifeDanielle Tcholakian in The Cut10 Quotes to Help You Find Hope During the Coronavirus PandemicCynthia Perkins, M.Ed. in Invisible IllnessAnxiety: How My First Bully Became My Oldest FriendCharlotte Buelow in The AscentAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

My story of OCPD: how I subconsciously stopped myself from living my best life,https://medium.com/@ivana.musich/my-story-of-ocpd-how-i-subconsciously-stopped-myself-from-living-my-best-life-9f961034e303?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Mentall Illness,Mental Health,Self,Self Improvement,Ocd","Mental illness, or whatever I thought that meant, did not apply to me. I did not suffer from one, nor have I been diagnosed with one. This all changed when a friend, who happens to be a life coach, challenged me to read more about mental disorders. One disorder in particular resonated very closely with my life.What is mental illness anyway? It can be defined as a pattern that causes distress or impairment of personal functioning, affecting how a person behaves, feels, perceives, or thinks. When we think of mental illness we may think of extreme cases where it is preventing a person from living their day to day life. The notion of ‘functioning’ is subjective. Even if you haven’t been diagnosed with a mental disorder, what if there was something lingering in the background, affecting your life in ways that are not as subtle as you think?I immersed myself in research and discovered Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder or OCPD. Health professionals describe it as “a personality disorder characterized by excessive concern with orderliness, perfectionism, attention to details, mental and interpersonal control, and a need for control over one’s environment, which interferes with flexibility, openness to experience.” Developed as a coping mechanism unconsciously in childhood, I now realize it is actually preventing me from manifesting the life I want to live as an adult.My research uncovered that people who have OCPD likely grew up with over-involved and overprotective parents who expected their strict rules to be followed. Disobedience to those rules was followed by punishment and grounding. These children, as a result, learned that in order to survive at home they needed to be perfect. They received praise for ‘being good’. Experts say that this can be labeled as learned behaviour, or in other words, a coping mechanism. Children start to believe that they need to follow the rules and be a good girl/boy, because if they don’t, they would disrupt everything in their environment, and therefore, it was their responsibility to ‘keep it together’.What a tall order.What I ‘learned’ is that I must do everything in my power to keep the order, to prevent the adults from freaking out, to prevent being grounded. As an adult, this developed a belief that, if I go toward what I desire (or break cultural rules), I will be punished. How do I avoid this so-called punishment? I try to control everything — things that are in my control and things that are not. (The illusion is that I think I can control everything). I’ve become accustomed to thinking that everything needs to be a certain way in order for me to feel safe and good about myself. There is a complete lack of trust in life and the unknown. There is very little room for risk-taking.Therefore I feel like I can conclude that for me personally, not manifesting my desires is my subconscious attempt at survival. I always thought I was living my best life, but when I reflect back on what living has looked like for me, it was merely survival, since I was too afraid to go after what I truly desired, in fear of punishment.How does such a person go in the direction of their dreams? How does someone manifest that which they want for themselves? They don’t. It doesn’t feel safe. It is better to manifest that which others approve of, leading to manifesting what is accepted culturally or socially, or even literally manifesting for others (making sure others are okay first, attending to their needs before your own).A perfectionist in the makingFor example, I have realized with my OCPD that I need to feel accomplished. As such, it is rare for me to take a day off and not check something off my list. I would consider that a waste of a day. I was so obsessed with efficiency that I would schedule activities weeks in advance, my calendar would be so detailed and planned out, there was no possibility to deviate from it. If everything is to be done from a place of accomplishment and the need to check off boxes, it would make sense that my life revolves around work. One way I centered my life around work was by living close to the office so that my commute would be short, so that I could maximize my day, so that I would have time after work to go to more places faster. Do you see the control? The thought of getting a dog was so overwhelming because it would throw a wrench in my calendar. The thought of jeopardizing my efficiency would send me into a panic. I would feel completely trapped by this mental narrative.OCPD has a positive side (there are two sides to any coin). It can make you productive, motivated, and efficient (a trait that’s extremely valuable at work). Individuals with OCPD are detail-oriented, take initiative, are reliable, loyal, and responsible. They think of the worst-case scenario all the time and then plan for it. It can make them an invaluable asset to a business and their boss.So, the point here is not to try to eliminate the OCPD or pretend it is not there. The alternative is to first understand where it comes from, and then to embrace where it can add value to my life, instead of letting it control me. Big difference. So instead of eliminating something that will likely never go away, I want to be able to pinpoint how it has had a negative effect on my life; how it has created a story and an illusion that I’m living and thriving, when I’m really not. The idea is to challenge the story created by OCPD in order to extend trust in life, the universe, whatever you want to call it. Stepping out of the confines of my made-up schedule and need to control outcomes can actually lead to better, unimaginable outcomes. With OCPD, you only know what you know, and you don’t even try to know what you don’t know. That is not a life well-lived.How do I catch myself now? When I start to spiral I ask myself a number of questions, such as:Am I controlling the outcome here?How am I being inflexible and what is it I am trying to protect myself from?Am I rescuing someone else? Why?Am I impressing someone else, or seeking to be validated?Am I making up chaos (story) in my head?These days I am trying to challenge my OCPD and the story it has created by consciously throwing a wrench in my schedule. And trying to move further away from downtown to escape that ‘go go go’ mentality. My OCPD will always be there, but with this newfound awareness, I want to consciously direct it in ways where it will be useful, and challenge it when it is not.Have you ever tried to identify what could be a mental health issue for you?

Mental Illness and Abuse. How Living Through It Can Make You Stronger,https://medium.com/@joannharris-53598/mental-illness-and-abuse-how-living-through-it-can-make-you-stronger-279ad060776c?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Addiction,Mentall Illness,Abuse,Emotional Abuse,Money","If you live or have lived with someone who had/has mental illness resulting in abuse to you I have a few insights from the pain I endured at the time that was happening to me.Somehow I always knew it would not last forever. I knew at some point it would be over one way or another. It took many years to accomplish this but it did end.His was acting wild, erratic, hyper-emotional, unstable, abusive, which resulted in being more of an alcoholic than I had ever scene. He would say he was going out for smokes and never return. The first time he did this it put me in panic mode. I called everyone of his friends to see if he was with them. Then it all bounced back on me as I asked myself if I had done something to cause this as I had never had such a thing happen to me before. We had only known each other a year or so and it never came up.He would finally come back the next day without any explanation. I asked him about what happened trying to get some understanding, but he didn’t feel he needed to explain. “Don’t bust my balls about it!” I left him alone.MENTAL ILLNESSIt all started for me about four to six years or so before my twin boys were born in another country. They are now twenty-five and doing well. Their Dad committed suicide from having schizo-effective disorder and being on so many psychiatric drugs so he could function. He felt that as well.In the end he fell and didn’t get treatment immediately. He was obnoxious, angry, and wouldn’t let anyone help him. He went to a doctor but lied about all the medications he was on. The doctor prescribed Morphine for his pain.DEATHThis was a grave mistake because my husband had an addictive nature. He also had been a drug addict in his early life, so he ultimately took an overdose on purpose. His boys were eleven.It is really a difficult to impossible feat to tell your children that their Dad killed himself.That was a very unusual day. We were divorced at the time and he was living with his brother. Their cousin was helping them move into an apartment a few days earlier. I got a call at work from the cousin just panicked to find her cousin, my ex, dead in bed. She had gone over to check on him and to bring more belongings.She kept asking, “What do I do?, What do I do?” I just told her to call the police to report it and I would be over presently.I assumed he felt he was wasting his life, so why not. It would be better for himself and everyone involved. He just gave up. He had nothing to live for in the state the drugs put him in and he could not live without them. He was supposed to go to psychotherapy but never wanted to do that.By the time I got there the police were there along with the Medical Examiner taking note of the scene. They found him dead and had fallen asleep with a cigarette hanging over an ashtray burned to the nub which was how he went to sleep. He smoked like a chimney. An addiction he had since he was a teen among other things. The Medical Examiner saw all the vials of drugs that he had been prescribed and just shook her head.His brother and cousin were in the living room really upset and crying, etc. His brother saying, “If I had only . . . .” I told him not to do that as his brother didn’t want any help and couldn’t let anyone do anything for him. He was stubborn like that.I did not cry. I was relieved of this burden in my life. I felt free, finally.After a bit he was wheeled out. They put up a sheet so no one could see him in his final state. I did not cry. I was relieved of this burden in my life. I felt free, finally.PAINI went back to work to check on things so I could leave for the day. I had to tell my children what happened.One of them had called the office complaining of being sick to his stomach. I went to the school and picked him up but left the other to finish out his day. No reason really to bring this to his attention before I was ready.I told the son that I had picked up from school what had happened that day after we got home. He was very upset and cried and I held him. He said he felt better after that. Then he went to take a nap.I waited for the other son to come home from school on the bus and then told him what happened. He was in the middle of gaming, sniffed a minute and went on playing. I thought that was not good but I thought it was better to wait for him to ask any questions then to cause more pain.They both knew how their Dad was being through multiple psychotic episodes that just resulted in him going to the VA to get his medications adjusted and staying for a few weeks until he calmed down. He had also scared them a few times and I was afraid he would eventually hurt them.A week or so later we had a small service with only a few people showing up. He had previously ostracized himself from his family, cousins, aunts, uncles, etc. because of his bad behavior that they had to endure most of their whole life. His Mom and Dad had passed away prior to this.The children released balloons and said goodbye. His brother and cousin took care of the burial. We didn’t go to the funeral either. I was too damned angry at him and I didn’t want the boys to have to go through whatever all that would have come to.LESSONS LEARNEDGod, Life, the Universe puts you here on Earth to teach you lessons so you can get more out of life.The StageEighteen years of marriage.Mental instability.Psychotic episodes.AngerAbuse — financially, mentally, emotionally and threats of physical violence.HomelessnessMove to another country out of group agreement.Twin boysMissing in Florida.Alcohol and drugsPrescription psychotic drugsIsolationYou can read more about this here.The Narcissist and the LadyKeep It All A Secretmedium.comWhat I have learned so far:Mental Strength — I learned to rely on myself and to find stability in my life by getting sanity back.For years I did not want to think for myself. I wanted him to think for me and create our life. For a long time he acted as if he could. When many setbacks occurred he went into a deep depression and started sleeping all day, every day.When that started I did not have the mental cohesiveness to cope and organize. I also did not have the financial independence to make our life better in the down times.My Voice — I learned to have a voice.I was always shy and afraid of everything. I was always second guessing myself and being very introverted. I was a very quiet person. I still am but in a different way. I found that if I didn’t speak up for what I wanted I would never get out, ever get it, and things would never get better.Wisdom — I learned a lot about a lot of things.I am glad that I was forty-four when I had the twins. He threatened to harm them more than once inside and outside the womb.If I had been younger I don’t think I could have cared for them and kept them safe as I was a follower instead of a leader. I was also extremely self-centered. You can’t be any of that when you have babies or baby.I also learned that if someone tells you who they are believe them. This was mentioned by Maya Angelo, the wisest person and the most beautiful teacher of the world. Very sad she is gone now but her books and sayings will live forever.I didn’t believe him when he told me he used to be a drug dealer, carried a gun, and spent 28 months in prison. I just didn’t believe him. It was too much for my poor, sheltered, inexperienced mind to comprehend. I know better now.Do Not Isolate Yourself — Stay connected to your family, friends, church members, communities. You can’t do anything all by yourself. Others can help and usually are willing.When we moved to Costa Rica and he said I did not need to know the language to live there, I believed him. That was wrong, just wrong.Costa Rica is a Spanish speaking country. My husband lived in Italy as a child so he was familiar with the Italian language and Spanish are similar.It would have been smart of me to have learned some Spanish before going there. I was willing but he shut me off to everyone. When we moved there people would come over and drink or party and I was left alone in another room or looked at funny. As if I was odd. I was also the one to furnish and clean up after these visitors both American and Costa Rican. No one was interested in me or how I felt about anything. He totally ridiculed me to others behind my back.We did not have a phone to call the USA. We did not have a television to enjoy some entertainment. I had no friends or if I did he ran them off with his destructive actions. He would be so obnoxious and angry when he drank that they did not want to come around again.It was like living in a bubble. You heard sounds but no meaning. This went on for a year. Remember Charlie Brown when adults talked, it was “wha, wha, wha, wha.” Same with me because I did not know Spanish.I also felt emotionally frozen, mentally flat, and alone.When I got pregnant I did find a doctor who spoke English. He was very kind and I liked him a lot but he never thought I was having twins. He was a General Practitioner/Family doctor. He was not the one that did the sonogram where we only saw one baby. But still I was bigger than a mother having one child should be. He should have thought differently or referred me to someone else.We all went out to eat a few times but my husband always took over the conversation and monopolized our fun. He drank and became obnoxious and disrespectful to a lot of people. I think the doctor didn’t like him either. The doctor also never came to the birth or to the hospital later. That’s probably why.Money — Don’t abuse it.We suffered a lot over those years. He worked for himself so sometimes there was a lot of money, sometimes there wasn’t. I worked as office support most of the time which is okay pay but not enough when there is an emergency. Even when you can’t pay bills or buy food that’s stressful.I did not have much earning power then and sometimes he would just not work. He slept a lot. I suppose he always suffered from depression and I did not know it. I thought it was just being lazy.I could not make my own decisions about money either until after he was gone. That was a huge freedom I had. I knew how to budget, pay bills, etc. but I did not know how to deal with no money and you still had to pay bills and such. It was extremely stressful.Abusive behavior when money is concerned is just wrong. He was an alcoholic and would go to bars and burn $100 dollar bills while people watched. Money we could have used for whatever. What made him act like that? Hard to say.Now I have earning power, and was the breadwinner for a long time. Retirement has put a stick in that but I still am the one that pays the bills and buys the food. I can make my own decisions where money is concerned as well.Other thoughtsI still have some issues when it comes to people, trust, love, other people’s motivations, etc. I suppose therapy could help.I am in a relationship now after twelve years with no one. I just don’t want anything to go badly. We have the freedom to be each other. No one tries to change the other. We just root for each other. We help each other and enjoy each other’s company. We care for each other and we are respectful to each other. It’s going on three years and I hope it lasts for awhile.That was what was missing a long time ago.Respect! It is very important.FinallyOne take-away from this would be to never give in to loneliness, isolation, defeat, ridicule, stress, anxiety or to threats.Keep in your mind that it will be over one day and you will have your freedom again. You will come out stronger as well.Jo Ann Harris is an author, parent, book devotee, writer, copywriter, and film fanatic. She is an autodidact who learns about everything and rows her own boat.

There are a lot of people who struggles and suffers in so many problems in their life.I’ve been in this situation lately. The world always seems against you. You lose all your hope, trust, and feel like a failure. I think that I’m a complete failure and worthless.Desperate is different from depression. Nevertheless, desperate can cause depression. A lot of things can cause depression or then will end up with mental illness. And there is also a lot of stuff that strong desperate up.In particular, like my friend’s said. Failure is relative. And so desperate — or, in this case, losing hope. The crash that I’ve been experiencing lately really drives me to depression. It isn’t straightforward when you lose your faith and give up on everything that you’ve manifested for it.Why do people get so desperate?A lot of people desperate because they can’t get what they’ve planned, frantic because they can’t revenge with a thing that will make their enemies mum, desperately seeking validation, or desperate because they were left by their loved one and so many more.Desperate is not only a condition when you want to hurt yourself or either kill yourself. It can also make someone want to harm others to express their hurts.How to deal with it?Like I’ve stated, desperate is different from depression. When you’re depressed, you lack energy, and thus you’re fatigued, resulting in some physical ailments like digestive problems, body ache, loss of appetite, etc. Like you feel you can’t do something because you know you’ll fail.But when you’re desperate, you’re loaded with energy to accomplish the task or get the work done. Also, you’re prepared to go to any extent by taking all sorts of risks — which what I’ve done recently. I still have so much ambition in myself self, but the world is not on my side, so I failed, and I’m losing my hope. Yet, when I fall, it will hit me so hard because it seems I’ve drained so much energy and time to achieve what I want.The best way to cope with desperate is to break for a while. Break, but don’t stop. You are just facing the bitterness of life, so you have to reflects what the world or God wants you to be.I needed somewhere to cry and not feel so alone, been going through a lot for a long time. I think for all of you, and I’m so sorry we’re all going through these feelings. It’s okay. For the right thoughts are not always your thoughts, neither are your ways my waysThe thing is, those of us who are drowning and cope with depression because of desperate might not realize it. Feel like a failure is okay. But, don’t forget to recover and stand up better. Those of us who are unspeakably ill might not even know that such an illness exists. Always mark in your mind that some mental illness isn’t something to be ashamed of.It’s okay to be sad. It’s okay to feel blue. I’m here to listen to all your miseries.Written byEliz PellokilaShe loves random and bizarre things.

N/A,https://medium.com/@Molly8/decompensation-e883858d1d06?source=tag_archive---------5-----------------------,"Prison Reform,Mentall Illness,Corrections,Frontline","Decompensation:How The Asylums of Last Resort are Failing Our Most Vulnerable PopulationsMolly HuffColorado Mesa UniversityDecompensation, by Todd (Hyung-Rae) Tarselli, a mentally ill prisoner in a super-maximum Pennsylvania facilityThe SummaryEssentially, this documentary was a representative example of the mental health crisis in America today; while Ohio and its correctional system specifically was the focus of the film, these scenarios and stories could have been from any prison — any state — in our country. The film estimated that there are approximately ten times as many mentally ill individuals incarcerated in America as there are mentally ill people in mental health treatment facilities and environments, a statistic that is backed up by the Torrey et. al. statewide study conducted in 2014 in Virginia; our textbook cites various studies that claim a range from less than a quarter to almost half of all US inmates “had a mental health problem” (Erickson & Erickson, 2008). Whatever the true number, it would seem that a system already overcapacity is also under the added and considerable burden of housing and dealing with the majority of the nation’s mentally ill.Because prisons and jails are not designed, staffed, or organized with mental health or treatment in mind, the hundreds of thousands of individuals with mental illnesses who find themselves incarcerated every year face an almost inevitable path of infractions, segregation, longer sentences, and the total collapse of any coping skills they may have had up until that point, also known as decompensation. Essentially, because “the prison does not exist to provide mental health treatment,” but rather to provide “safety and security to the community,” behavior that is symptomatic of the individual’s mental illness will inevitably be seen as disciplinary misconduct and treated accordingly by a staff that is prepped to quell violence and disruption harshly and unanimously (Navasky & O’Connor, 2005). To be specific, the disruptive behavior that is often a direct result of their mental illness and anguish results in extended stays in segregation and near-constant visits from extraction teams, the SWAT teams of the incarceration world who wear riot gear and bum-rush these individuals into brute submission. A life spent largely in solitary confinement with only delusions and psychotic episodes for company, punctuated by the occasional extraction visit, all but ensures that, as pointed out by the film, those who enter incarceration mentally ill invariably get worse and those who enter mentally normative invariably become to some degree mentally ill. Indeed, a federal judge stated in the opinion written after Madrid v. Gomez that placing these vulnerable inmates into solitary confinement “is the mental equivalent of putting an asthmatic in a place with little air to breathe” (Haney, 2017).Cause of the IssueDeinstitutionalization is inarguably the root cause of our prisons and jails becoming the de facto mental health solution of the United States. One thing that is crucial to understanding many themes and trends within the criminal justice history of the United States is the historical tendency for our policies and practices to swing from one end of the pendulum (the crime-control model, in which public safety is the number one priority) to the other (due process, wherein concern for the constitutional rights of individuals brought before the state take precedence). Indeed, it was the accepted practice to house the mentally ill in jails and prisons for the beginning of our nation’s history — just as we do today — until the nineteenth century, when the switch was made to the state-run hospitals and asylums that quickly became overrun and understaffed. In turn, this became the norm until the aforementioned deinstitutionalization of the mid-twentieth century (Torrey et. al., 2016). While many people would perhaps be quick to assume that the mass closure and downsizing of most state mental hospitals in America was the result of callous financial and political games, it was actually an empathetic and compassionate (if not short-sighted) response to what had become atrocious conditions and overcrowding, leaving the country’s most vulnerable in deplorable conditions. The well-intentioned idea was that the warehousing of mentally ill people in these asylums would be replaced by intimate and personalized community treatment, wherein society would take care of their own from the bottom up. While this is the ideal solution, the doors of state mental hospitals were closed en masse with very little of the necessary community infrastructure in place or even the ability to do so. The results were predictable, in hindsight: an exodus of people with very little social support or coping skills to the streets and underpasses of America.Simultaneously, the pendulum of the American criminal justice system has been swinging inexorably back towards the crime-control model ever since the civil rights era, meaning that the socially unacceptable or even frightening or bewildering behavior displayed by a mentally ill and homeless person going about their day began to be routinely greeted with arrest and incarceration. Haney speaks to the “decontextualization of criminality, which has greatly expanded the reach of the criminal justice system and removed consideration of social factors…from the sentencing calculus”; the routine arrest of people who are at worst in a state of psychosis is the culmination of this trend.Whereas the index crimes for the vast majority of the incarcerated mentally ill in America are nonviolent and extremely minor, upon incarceration their behavior is naturally exacerbated and worsened by the environment itself, which has marked effects on even the correctional officers and administrative staff who get to leave at the end of the workday. The fear and violence of the prison environment is almost entirely antithetical to the one in which mentally ill individuals should be. One inmate filmed for the documentary perfectly illustrated the results of what Haney termed an “ecology of cruelty”: Carl McEachron, sent to prison for a crime that carried with it a maximum sentence of 3 years, had spent 16 years in prison at the time of filming due to infractions and violations directly related to his mental illness (Haney, 2017; Navasky & O’Connor, 2005).Solutions to the IssueWhile a feasible solution may appear too daunting to consider, there is a welcome and encouraging consensus in the literature regarding how to begin to mediate this public health crisis. For example, almost all professionals even tangentially involved in this problem agree that “individuals with severe mental disorders who are in need of treatment belong in hospitals, not in prisons and jails” (Torrey et. al., 2016). The mass implementation of Crisis Intervention Training across law enforcement agencies, as well as their partnership with Acute Trauma Units and advocacy services, could prevent thousands of arrests and recidivisms every year. Keeping these people in the community and on top of their medication management and well-being makes good fiscal as well as moral sense, not to mention the public safety component. As the director of Ohio’s corrections stated in the documentary, he became not only a prison warden but a mental health director when he accepted the job; no aspect of our current correctional system is prepared for or geared towards this type of massive social responsibility.My Thoughts/Opinions on the FilmI was extremely struck by the footage that this documentary showed from the archives of the prisons themselves: watching mentally disturbed and possibly psychotic inmates get tactically and brutally subdued by men in masks and riot gear and dragged out of the tiny cells in which they spend their entire lives gave me a chilling sense of perspective into the type of horrifying reality these individuals live in when they are left in a cell without adequate treatment or medication. Our textbook decried the asylums and hospitals that prisons replaced, where “hoods were placed on patients’ heads in an effort to quiet their minds” (Erickson & Erickson, 2008). This film did an excellent job of showing just how far contemporary prisons have gone in their efforts to fill their predecessor’s shoes.CitationsErickson, P. E., & Erickson, S. K. (2008).

Recognizing Emerging Mental Illness,https://medium.com/@kartardiamond/recognizing-emerging-mental-illness-e6effce5cab7?source=tag_archive---------6-----------------------,"Mentall Illness,Misdiagnosis,Self Medicating,Drug Use","Photo by MaximoRecognizing mental illness when it first emerges can be extremely difficult, even for family members who are so familiar with the personality and character of their suffering loved one. This can be an agonizing and fear-inducing predicament for obvious reasons. What makes the recognition of mental illness so challenging can be blamed on several factors.Firstly, the average person is not expected to be educated about mental illness, unless they already have someone in their life with a well-established mental illness. Some cultures make people extraordinarily uncomfortable with even speculating that a family member could be ill and they procrastinate in seeking out professional help or even discussing it privately. Because there is a lot of stigma associated with mental illnesses, both the sufferer and their family may want to assume anything else could be going on besides a diagnosis which can alter a person’s life forever and profoundly.When mental illness first manifests, if the person experiencing it is young, like a teenager, their odd behaviors and symptoms could be hastily written off as the result of teenage hormones. Young males especially can engage in risky, aggressive, or manic behaviors that are misinterpreted precisely because of their youth and immaturity.Because of the prevalence of drug abuse in our society, it’s also a common reflexive response for family members to think that their ill child or sibling may be acting strange and unpredictable because they are under the influence of drugs or alcohol. In fact, even when we suspect that a person may have psychological issues, we still consider the possibility that their most disturbing symptoms could be caused by self-medicating with drugs. During one of my own son’s longer hospitalizations, I was stunned to find out he was not under the influence of street drugs when he committed some very anti-social behaviors.Another reason why it is so hard to recognize emerging mental illness is because some people are actually fairly good at hiding it for a while, intentionally or not. Parents are often told to notice if their child suddenly withdraws from their friends, starts doing poorly in school, or seems to have a sudden personality shift. These are important clues, but some kids or young adults can still pretend they are doing fine when they are not, until something really dramatic or explosive happens, taking everyone by surprise.We also need to separate out what may be defined clinically as a personality disorder or a mood disorder, compared with full-blown serious mental illness. For example, anxiety can be very concerning and debilitating. Some behaviors associated with anxiety can even reveal and underlying psychotic process. But there is a world of difference between general anxiety disorder and schizophrenia.There are clinical descriptions of what constitutes a mental illness, but some of those behaviors and symptoms need to occur continuously over at least a six month period of time before it can be confirmed. It is also very common for diagnoses to change as more and different symptoms emerge. Psychiatrists do their best to be accurate, but they do not have any type of physical examination to determine a mental disorder. In fact, sometimes they can only come to conclusions based on what the mentally ill person admits to them. When a person with a thought disorder relays their own symptoms, their perceptions and memories could be far from accurate or objective. Further, it is also common for people to have a co-occurring diagnosis. For example, a person may have both anxiety and depression. A person diagnosed with both schizophrenia and a mood disorder is referred to as schizoaffective disorder. The term “dual diagnosis” now implies a mental illness along with a substance abuse disorder.Some medications address targeted issues, but with a misdiagnosis the side effects can be substantial. For instance, if a person initially acts depressed, they may be prescribed an anti-depressant. If the person actually has bipolar disorder, the anti-depressant could propel the person into a manic episode. Most of us have heard the commercials on TV with the long list of scary side-effects from medications. The wrong prescription could increase a person’s symptoms or cause completely different ones, including suicidal ideation.Roughly 20% of the general population will experience some form of psychological stress at points in their life which is significant enough to warrant professional help. Being depressed over genuinely stressful life events like divorce or job loss will eventually subside when circumstances improve and when temporary therapy or other treatments are utilized. Serious mental illness, however, needs to be managed for a life time, often with unsatisfactory results.One thing for sure is that the more we openly discuss mental illness, the less stigmatized it will become. In turn, more people will seek out treatment sooner and compliance to medication or therapy will also be more successful.Written byKartar DiamondFeng Shui consultant, author & teacher since 1992. www.FengShuiSolutions.net I also write about other metaphysical topics and mental health advocacy.Follow1 1 1 Mentall IllnessMisdiagnosisSelf MedicatingDrug UseMore from Kartar DiamondFollowFeng Shui consultant, author & teacher since 1992. www.FengShuiSolutions.net I also write about other metaphysical topics and mental health advocacy.More From MediumWhy Disconnecting Made Me Feel More ConnectedEvan McCoy in Invisible IllnessWhen Everyone Thinks You’re Overreacting, But You’re NotRuss W in Invisible IllnessThe Underestimated Ways Depression Can Enrich Your LifeCarine Ru in Invisible IllnessDoes My Inflamed Brain Make Me Suicidal?Toni Tails in SURVIVORSHow Pottery Helped Me Overcome My AnxietyDaniel A in The AscentWhat It’s Like to Know You’ll Be on Antidepressants for LifeDanielle Tcholakian in The Cut10 Quotes to Help You Find Hope During the Coronavirus PandemicCynthia Perkins, M.Ed. in Invisible IllnessAnxiety: How My First Bully Became My Oldest FriendCharlotte Buelow in The AscentAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

My story of OCPD: how I subconsciously stopped myself from living my best life,https://medium.com/@ivana.musich/my-story-of-ocpd-how-i-subconsciously-stopped-myself-from-living-my-best-life-9f961034e303?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Mentall Illness,Mental Health,Self,Self Improvement,Ocd","Mental illness, or whatever I thought that meant, did not apply to me. I did not suffer from one, nor have I been diagnosed with one. This all changed when a friend, who happens to be a life coach, challenged me to read more about mental disorders. One disorder in particular resonated very closely with my life.What is mental illness anyway? It can be defined as a pattern that causes distress or impairment of personal functioning, affecting how a person behaves, feels, perceives, or thinks. When we think of mental illness we may think of extreme cases where it is preventing a person from living their day to day life. The notion of ‘functioning’ is subjective. Even if you haven’t been diagnosed with a mental disorder, what if there was something lingering in the background, affecting your life in ways that are not as subtle as you think?I immersed myself in research and discovered Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder or OCPD. Health professionals describe it as “a personality disorder characterized by excessive concern with orderliness, perfectionism, attention to details, mental and interpersonal control, and a need for control over one’s environment, which interferes with flexibility, openness to experience.” Developed as a coping mechanism unconsciously in childhood, I now realize it is actually preventing me from manifesting the life I want to live as an adult.My research uncovered that people who have OCPD likely grew up with over-involved and overprotective parents who expected their strict rules to be followed. Disobedience to those rules was followed by punishment and grounding. These children, as a result, learned that in order to survive at home they needed to be perfect. They received praise for ‘being good’. Experts say that this can be labeled as learned behaviour, or in other words, a coping mechanism. Children start to believe that they need to follow the rules and be a good girl/boy, because if they don’t, they would disrupt everything in their environment, and therefore, it was their responsibility to ‘keep it together’.What a tall order.What I ‘learned’ is that I must do everything in my power to keep the order, to prevent the adults from freaking out, to prevent being grounded. As an adult, this developed a belief that, if I go toward what I desire (or break cultural rules), I will be punished. How do I avoid this so-called punishment? I try to control everything — things that are in my control and things that are not. (The illusion is that I think I can control everything). I’ve become accustomed to thinking that everything needs to be a certain way in order for me to feel safe and good about myself. There is a complete lack of trust in life and the unknown. There is very little room for risk-taking.Therefore I feel like I can conclude that for me personally, not manifesting my desires is my subconscious attempt at survival. I always thought I was living my best life, but when I reflect back on what living has looked like for me, it was merely survival, since I was too afraid to go after what I truly desired, in fear of punishment.How does such a person go in the direction of their dreams? How does someone manifest that which they want for themselves? They don’t. It doesn’t feel safe. It is better to manifest that which others approve of, leading to manifesting what is accepted culturally or socially, or even literally manifesting for others (making sure others are okay first, attending to their needs before your own).A perfectionist in the makingFor example, I have realized with my OCPD that I need to feel accomplished. As such, it is rare for me to take a day off and not check something off my list. I would consider that a waste of a day. I was so obsessed with efficiency that I would schedule activities weeks in advance, my calendar would be so detailed and planned out, there was no possibility to deviate from it. If everything is to be done from a place of accomplishment and the need to check off boxes, it would make sense that my life revolves around work. One way I centered my life around work was by living close to the office so that my commute would be short, so that I could maximize my day, so that I would have time after work to go to more places faster. Do you see the control? The thought of getting a dog was so overwhelming because it would throw a wrench in my calendar. The thought of jeopardizing my efficiency would send me into a panic. I would feel completely trapped by this mental narrative.OCPD has a positive side (there are two sides to any coin). It can make you productive, motivated, and efficient (a trait that’s extremely valuable at work). Individuals with OCPD are detail-oriented, take initiative, are reliable, loyal, and responsible. They think of the worst-case scenario all the time and then plan for it. It can make them an invaluable asset to a business and their boss.So, the point here is not to try to eliminate the OCPD or pretend it is not there. The alternative is to first understand where it comes from, and then to embrace where it can add value to my life, instead of letting it control me. Big difference. So instead of eliminating something that will likely never go away, I want to be able to pinpoint how it has had a negative effect on my life; how it has created a story and an illusion that I’m living and thriving, when I’m really not. The idea is to challenge the story created by OCPD in order to extend trust in life, the universe, whatever you want to call it. Stepping out of the confines of my made-up schedule and need to control outcomes can actually lead to better, unimaginable outcomes. With OCPD, you only know what you know, and you don’t even try to know what you don’t know. That is not a life well-lived.How do I catch myself now? When I start to spiral I ask myself a number of questions, such as:Am I controlling the outcome here?How am I being inflexible and what is it I am trying to protect myself from?Am I rescuing someone else? Why?Am I impressing someone else, or seeking to be validated?Am I making up chaos (story) in my head?These days I am trying to challenge my OCPD and the story it has created by consciously throwing a wrench in my schedule. And trying to move further away from downtown to escape that ‘go go go’ mentality. My OCPD will always be there, but with this newfound awareness, I want to consciously direct it in ways where it will be useful, and challenge it when it is not.Have you ever tried to identify what could be a mental health issue for you?

Mental Illness and Abuse. How Living Through It Can Make You Stronger,https://medium.com/@joannharris-53598/mental-illness-and-abuse-how-living-through-it-can-make-you-stronger-279ad060776c?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Addiction,Mentall Illness,Abuse,Emotional Abuse,Money","If you live or have lived with someone who had/has mental illness resulting in abuse to you I have a few insights from the pain I endured at the time that was happening to me.Somehow I always knew it would not last forever. I knew at some point it would be over one way or another. It took many years to accomplish this but it did end.His was acting wild, erratic, hyper-emotional, unstable, abusive, which resulted in being more of an alcoholic than I had ever scene. He would say he was going out for smokes and never return. The first time he did this it put me in panic mode. I called everyone of his friends to see if he was with them. Then it all bounced back on me as I asked myself if I had done something to cause this as I had never had such a thing happen to me before. We had only known each other a year or so and it never came up.He would finally come back the next day without any explanation. I asked him about what happened trying to get some understanding, but he didn’t feel he needed to explain. “Don’t bust my balls about it!” I left him alone.MENTAL ILLNESSIt all started for me about four to six years or so before my twin boys were born in another country. They are now twenty-five and doing well. Their Dad committed suicide from having schizo-effective disorder and being on so many psychiatric drugs so he could function. He felt that as well.In the end he fell and didn’t get treatment immediately. He was obnoxious, angry, and wouldn’t let anyone help him. He went to a doctor but lied about all the medications he was on. The doctor prescribed Morphine for his pain.DEATHThis was a grave mistake because my husband had an addictive nature. He also had been a drug addict in his early life, so he ultimately took an overdose on purpose. His boys were eleven.It is really a difficult to impossible feat to tell your children that their Dad killed himself.That was a very unusual day. We were divorced at the time and he was living with his brother. Their cousin was helping them move into an apartment a few days earlier. I got a call at work from the cousin just panicked to find her cousin, my ex, dead in bed. She had gone over to check on him and to bring more belongings.She kept asking, “What do I do?, What do I do?” I just told her to call the police to report it and I would be over presently.I assumed he felt he was wasting his life, so why not. It would be better for himself and everyone involved. He just gave up. He had nothing to live for in the state the drugs put him in and he could not live without them. He was supposed to go to psychotherapy but never wanted to do that.By the time I got there the police were there along with the Medical Examiner taking note of the scene. They found him dead and had fallen asleep with a cigarette hanging over an ashtray burned to the nub which was how he went to sleep. He smoked like a chimney. An addiction he had since he was a teen among other things. The Medical Examiner saw all the vials of drugs that he had been prescribed and just shook her head.His brother and cousin were in the living room really upset and crying, etc. His brother saying, “If I had only . . . .” I told him not to do that as his brother didn’t want any help and couldn’t let anyone do anything for him. He was stubborn like that.I did not cry. I was relieved of this burden in my life. I felt free, finally.After a bit he was wheeled out. They put up a sheet so no one could see him in his final state. I did not cry. I was relieved of this burden in my life. I felt free, finally.PAINI went back to work to check on things so I could leave for the day. I had to tell my children what happened.One of them had called the office complaining of being sick to his stomach. I went to the school and picked him up but left the other to finish out his day. No reason really to bring this to his attention before I was ready.I told the son that I had picked up from school what had happened that day after we got home. He was very upset and cried and I held him. He said he felt better after that. Then he went to take a nap.I waited for the other son to come home from school on the bus and then told him what happened. He was in the middle of gaming, sniffed a minute and went on playing. I thought that was not good but I thought it was better to wait for him to ask any questions then to cause more pain.They both knew how their Dad was being through multiple psychotic episodes that just resulted in him going to the VA to get his medications adjusted and staying for a few weeks until he calmed down. He had also scared them a few times and I was afraid he would eventually hurt them.A week or so later we had a small service with only a few people showing up. He had previously ostracized himself from his family, cousins, aunts, uncles, etc. because of his bad behavior that they had to endure most of their whole life. His Mom and Dad had passed away prior to this.The children released balloons and said goodbye. His brother and cousin took care of the burial. We didn’t go to the funeral either. I was too damned angry at him and I didn’t want the boys to have to go through whatever all that would have come to.LESSONS LEARNEDGod, Life, the Universe puts you here on Earth to teach you lessons so you can get more out of life.The StageEighteen years of marriage.Mental instability.Psychotic episodes.AngerAbuse — financially, mentally, emotionally and threats of physical violence.HomelessnessMove to another country out of group agreement.Twin boysMissing in Florida.Alcohol and drugsPrescription psychotic drugsIsolationYou can read more about this here.The Narcissist and the LadyKeep It All A Secretmedium.comWhat I have learned so far:Mental Strength — I learned to rely on myself and to find stability in my life by getting sanity back.For years I did not want to think for myself. I wanted him to think for me and create our life. For a long time he acted as if he could. When many setbacks occurred he went into a deep depression and started sleeping all day, every day.When that started I did not have the mental cohesiveness to cope and organize. I also did not have the financial independence to make our life better in the down times.My Voice — I learned to have a voice.I was always shy and afraid of everything. I was always second guessing myself and being very introverted. I was a very quiet person. I still am but in a different way. I found that if I didn’t speak up for what I wanted I would never get out, ever get it, and things would never get better.Wisdom — I learned a lot about a lot of things.I am glad that I was forty-four when I had the twins. He threatened to harm them more than once inside and outside the womb.If I had been younger I don’t think I could have cared for them and kept them safe as I was a follower instead of a leader. I was also extremely self-centered. You can’t be any of that when you have babies or baby.I also learned that if someone tells you who they are believe them. This was mentioned by Maya Angelo, the wisest person and the most beautiful teacher of the world. Very sad she is gone now but her books and sayings will live forever.I didn’t believe him when he told me he used to be a drug dealer, carried a gun, and spent 28 months in prison. I just didn’t believe him. It was too much for my poor, sheltered, inexperienced mind to comprehend. I know better now.Do Not Isolate Yourself — Stay connected to your family, friends, church members, communities. You can’t do anything all by yourself. Others can help and usually are willing.When we moved to Costa Rica and he said I did not need to know the language to live there, I believed him. That was wrong, just wrong.Costa Rica is a Spanish speaking country. My husband lived in Italy as a child so he was familiar with the Italian language and Spanish are similar.It would have been smart of me to have learned some Spanish before going there. I was willing but he shut me off to everyone. When we moved there people would come over and drink or party and I was left alone in another room or looked at funny. As if I was odd. I was also the one to furnish and clean up after these visitors both American and Costa Rican. No one was interested in me or how I felt about anything. He totally ridiculed me to others behind my back.We did not have a phone to call the USA. We did not have a television to enjoy some entertainment. I had no friends or if I did he ran them off with his destructive actions. He would be so obnoxious and angry when he drank that they did not want to come around again.It was like living in a bubble. You heard sounds but no meaning. This went on for a year. Remember Charlie Brown when adults talked, it was “wha, wha, wha, wha.” Same with me because I did not know Spanish.I also felt emotionally frozen, mentally flat, and alone.When I got pregnant I did find a doctor who spoke English. He was very kind and I liked him a lot but he never thought I was having twins. He was a General Practitioner/Family doctor. He was not the one that did the sonogram where we only saw one baby. But still I was bigger than a mother having one child should be. He should have thought differently or referred me to someone else.We all went out to eat a few times but my husband always took over the conversation and monopolized our fun. He drank and became obnoxious and disrespectful to a lot of people. I think the doctor didn’t like him either. The doctor also never came to the birth or to the hospital later. That’s probably why.Money — Don’t abuse it.We suffered a lot over those years. He worked for himself so sometimes there was a lot of money, sometimes there wasn’t. I worked as office support most of the time which is okay pay but not enough when there is an emergency. Even when you can’t pay bills or buy food that’s stressful.I did not have much earning power then and sometimes he would just not work. He slept a lot. I suppose he always suffered from depression and I did not know it. I thought it was just being lazy.I could not make my own decisions about money either until after he was gone. That was a huge freedom I had. I knew how to budget, pay bills, etc. but I did not know how to deal with no money and you still had to pay bills and such. It was extremely stressful.Abusive behavior when money is concerned is just wrong. He was an alcoholic and would go to bars and burn $100 dollar bills while people watched. Money we could have used for whatever. What made him act like that? Hard to say.Now I have earning power, and was the breadwinner for a long time. Retirement has put a stick in that but I still am the one that pays the bills and buys the food. I can make my own decisions where money is concerned as well.Other thoughtsI still have some issues when it comes to people, trust, love, other people’s motivations, etc. I suppose therapy could help.I am in a relationship now after twelve years with no one. I just don’t want anything to go badly. We have the freedom to be each other. No one tries to change the other. We just root for each other. We help each other and enjoy each other’s company. We care for each other and we are respectful to each other. It’s going on three years and I hope it lasts for awhile.That was what was missing a long time ago.Respect! It is very important.FinallyOne take-away from this would be to never give in to loneliness, isolation, defeat, ridicule, stress, anxiety or to threats.Keep in your mind that it will be over one day and you will have your freedom again. You will come out stronger as well.Jo Ann Harris is an author, parent, book devotee, writer, copywriter, and film fanatic. She is an autodidact who learns about everything and rows her own boat.

Mental Health Series,https://medium.com/@elizpellokila/mental-health-series-1034748a5c8a?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"Desperate,Mentall Illness,Mental Health,Depression,Mental Health Awareness","Chapter 1: DesperateHaving lost all hope.Feeling, showing, or involving a hopeless sense that a situation is so bad as to be impossible to deal with.Don’t you realize that everything that looks okay is not always “okay”? There are a lot of people who struggles and suffers in so many problems in their life.I’ve been in this situation lately. The world always seems against you. You lose all your hope, trust, and feel like a failure. I think that I’m a complete failure and worthless.Desperate is different from depression. Nevertheless, desperate can cause depression. A lot of things can cause depression or then will end up with mental illness. And there is also a lot of stuff that strong desperate up.In particular, like my friend’s said. Failure is relative. And so desperate — or, in this case, losing hope. The crash that I’ve been experiencing lately really drives me to depression. It isn’t straightforward when you lose your faith and give up on everything that you’ve manifested for it.Why do people get so desperate?A lot of people desperate because they can’t get what they’ve planned, frantic because they can’t revenge with a thing that will make their enemies mum, desperately seeking validation, or desperate because they were left by their loved one and so many more.Desperate is not only a condition when you want to hurt yourself or either kill yourself. It can also make someone want to harm others to express their hurts.How to deal with it?Like I’ve stated, desperate is different from depression. When you’re depressed, you lack energy, and thus you’re fatigued, resulting in some physical ailments like digestive problems, body ache, loss of appetite, etc. Like you feel you can’t do something because you know you’ll fail.But when you’re desperate, you’re loaded with energy to accomplish the task or get the work done. Also, you’re prepared to go to any extent by taking all sorts of risks — which what I’ve done recently. I still have so much ambition in myself self, but the world is not on my side, so I failed, and I’m losing my hope. Yet, when I fall, it will hit me so hard because it seems I’ve drained so much energy and time to achieve what I want.The best way to cope with desperate is to break for a while. Break, but don’t stop. You are just facing the bitterness of life, so you have to reflects what the world or God wants you to be.I needed somewhere to cry and not feel so alone, been going through a lot for a long time. I think for all of you, and I’m so sorry we’re all going through these feelings. It’s okay. For the right thoughts are not always your thoughts, neither are your ways my waysThe thing is, those of us who are drowning and cope with depression because of desperate might not realize it. Feel like a failure is okay. But, don’t forget to recover and stand up better. Those of us who are unspeakably ill might not even know that such an illness exists. Always mark in your mind that some mental illness isn’t something to be ashamed of.It’s okay to be sad. It’s okay to feel blue. I’m here to listen to all your miseries.Written byEliz PellokilaShe loves random and bizarre things.

N/A,https://medium.com/@Molly8/decompensation-e883858d1d06?source=tag_archive---------5-----------------------,"Prison Reform,Mentall Illness,Corrections,Frontline","Decompensation:How The Asylums of Last Resort are Failing Our Most Vulnerable PopulationsMolly HuffColorado Mesa UniversityDecompensation, by Todd (Hyung-Rae) Tarselli, a mentally ill prisoner in a super-maximum Pennsylvania facilityThe SummaryEssentially, this documentary was a representative example of the mental health crisis in America today; while Ohio and its correctional system specifically was the focus of the film, these scenarios and stories could have been from any prison — any state — in our country. The film estimated that there are approximately ten times as many mentally ill individuals incarcerated in America as there are mentally ill people in mental health treatment facilities and environments, a statistic that is backed up by the Torrey et. al. statewide study conducted in 2014 in Virginia; our textbook cites various studies that claim a range from less than a quarter to almost half of all US inmates “had a mental health problem” (Erickson & Erickson, 2008). Whatever the true number, it would seem that a system already overcapacity is also under the added and considerable burden of housing and dealing with the majority of the nation’s mentally ill.Because prisons and jails are not designed, staffed, or organized with mental health or treatment in mind, the hundreds of thousands of individuals with mental illnesses who find themselves incarcerated every year face an almost inevitable path of infractions, segregation, longer sentences, and the total collapse of any coping skills they may have had up until that point, also known as decompensation. Essentially, because “the prison does not exist to provide mental health treatment,” but rather to provide “safety and security to the community,” behavior that is symptomatic of the individual’s mental illness will inevitably be seen as disciplinary misconduct and treated accordingly by a staff that is prepped to quell violence and disruption harshly and unanimously (Navasky & O’Connor, 2005). To be specific, the disruptive behavior that is often a direct result of their mental illness and anguish results in extended stays in segregation and near-constant visits from extraction teams, the SWAT teams of the incarceration world who wear riot gear and bum-rush these individuals into brute submission. A life spent largely in solitary confinement with only delusions and psychotic episodes for company, punctuated by the occasional extraction visit, all but ensures that, as pointed out by the film, those who enter incarceration mentally ill invariably get worse and those who enter mentally normative invariably become to some degree mentally ill. Indeed, a federal judge stated in the opinion written after Madrid v. Gomez that placing these vulnerable inmates into solitary confinement “is the mental equivalent of putting an asthmatic in a place with little air to breathe” (Haney, 2017).Cause of the IssueDeinstitutionalization is inarguably the root cause of our prisons and jails becoming the de facto mental health solution of the United States. One thing that is crucial to understanding many themes and trends within the criminal justice history of the United States is the historical tendency for our policies and practices to swing from one end of the pendulum (the crime-control model, in which public safety is the number one priority) to the other (due process, wherein concern for the constitutional rights of individuals brought before the state take precedence). Indeed, it was the accepted practice to house the mentally ill in jails and prisons for the beginning of our nation’s history — just as we do today — until the nineteenth century, when the switch was made to the state-run hospitals and asylums that quickly became overrun and understaffed. In turn, this became the norm until the aforementioned deinstitutionalization of the mid-twentieth century (Torrey et. al., 2016). While many people would perhaps be quick to assume that the mass closure and downsizing of most state mental hospitals in America was the result of callous financial and political games, it was actually an empathetic and compassionate (if not short-sighted) response to what had become atrocious conditions and overcrowding, leaving the country’s most vulnerable in deplorable conditions. The well-intentioned idea was that the warehousing of mentally ill people in these asylums would be replaced by intimate and personalized community treatment, wherein society would take care of their own from the bottom up. While this is the ideal solution, the doors of state mental hospitals were closed en masse with very little of the necessary community infrastructure in place or even the ability to do so. The results were predictable, in hindsight: an exodus of people with very little social support or coping skills to the streets and underpasses of America.Simultaneously, the pendulum of the American criminal justice system has been swinging inexorably back towards the crime-control model ever since the civil rights era, meaning that the socially unacceptable or even frightening or bewildering behavior displayed by a mentally ill and homeless person going about their day began to be routinely greeted with arrest and incarceration. Haney speaks to the “decontextualization of criminality, which has greatly expanded the reach of the criminal justice system and removed consideration of social factors…from the sentencing calculus”; the routine arrest of people who are at worst in a state of psychosis is the culmination of this trend.Whereas the index crimes for the vast majority of the incarcerated mentally ill in America are nonviolent and extremely minor, upon incarceration their behavior is naturally exacerbated and worsened by the environment itself, which has marked effects on even the correctional officers and administrative staff who get to leave at the end of the workday. The fear and violence of the prison environment is almost entirely antithetical to the one in which mentally ill individuals should be. One inmate filmed for the documentary perfectly illustrated the results of what Haney termed an “ecology of cruelty”: Carl McEachron, sent to prison for a crime that carried with it a maximum sentence of 3 years, had spent 16 years in prison at the time of filming due to infractions and violations directly related to his mental illness (Haney, 2017; Navasky & O’Connor, 2005).Solutions to the IssueWhile a feasible solution may appear too daunting to consider, there is a welcome and encouraging consensus in the literature regarding how to begin to mediate this public health crisis. For example, almost all professionals even tangentially involved in this problem agree that “individuals with severe mental disorders who are in need of treatment belong in hospitals, not in prisons and jails” (Torrey et. al., 2016). The mass implementation of Crisis Intervention Training across law enforcement agencies, as well as their partnership with Acute Trauma Units and advocacy services, could prevent thousands of arrests and recidivisms every year. Keeping these people in the community and on top of their medication management and well-being makes good fiscal as well as moral sense, not to mention the public safety component. As the director of Ohio’s corrections stated in the documentary, he became not only a prison warden but a mental health director when he accepted the job; no aspect of our current correctional system is prepared for or geared towards this type of massive social responsibility.My Thoughts/Opinions on the FilmI was extremely struck by the footage that this documentary showed from the archives of the prisons themselves: watching mentally disturbed and possibly psychotic inmates get tactically and brutally subdued by men in masks and riot gear and dragged out of the tiny cells in which they spend their entire lives gave me a chilling sense of perspective into the type of horrifying reality these individuals live in when they are left in a cell without adequate treatment or medication. Our textbook decried the asylums and hospitals that prisons replaced, where “hoods were placed on patients’ heads in an effort to quiet their minds” (Erickson & Erickson, 2008). This film did an excellent job of showing just how far contemporary prisons have gone in their efforts to fill their predecessor’s shoes.CitationsErickson, P. E., & Erickson, S. K. (2008).

Recognizing Emerging Mental Illness,https://medium.com/@kartardiamond/recognizing-emerging-mental-illness-e6effce5cab7?source=tag_archive---------6-----------------------,"Mentall Illness,Misdiagnosis,Self Medicating,Drug Use","Photo by MaximoRecognizing mental illness when it first emerges can be extremely difficult, even for family members who are so familiar with the personality and character of their suffering loved one. This can be an agonizing and fear-inducing predicament for obvious reasons. What makes the recognition of mental illness so challenging can be blamed on several factors.Firstly, the average person is not expected to be educated about mental illness, unless they already have someone in their life with a well-established mental illness. Some cultures make people extraordinarily uncomfortable with even speculating that a family member could be ill and they procrastinate in seeking out professional help or even discussing it privately. Because there is a lot of stigma associated with mental illnesses, both the sufferer and their family may want to assume anything else could be going on besides a diagnosis which can alter a person’s life forever and profoundly.When mental illness first manifests, if the person experiencing it is young, like a teenager, their odd behaviors and symptoms could be hastily written off as the result of teenage hormones. Young males especially can engage in risky, aggressive, or manic behaviors that are misinterpreted precisely because of their youth and immaturity.Because of the prevalence of drug abuse in our society, it’s also a common reflexive response for family members to think that their ill child or sibling may be acting strange and unpredictable because they are under the influence of drugs or alcohol. In fact, even when we suspect that a person may have psychological issues, we still consider the possibility that their most disturbing symptoms could be caused by self-medicating with drugs. During one of my own son’s longer hospitalizations, I was stunned to find out he was not under the influence of street drugs when he committed some very anti-social behaviors.Another reason why it is so hard to recognize emerging mental illness is because some people are actually fairly good at hiding it for a while, intentionally or not. Parents are often told to notice if their child suddenly withdraws from their friends, starts doing poorly in school, or seems to have a sudden personality shift. These are important clues, but some kids or young adults can still pretend they are doing fine when they are not, until something really dramatic or explosive happens, taking everyone by surprise.We also need to separate out what may be defined clinically as a personality disorder or a mood disorder, compared with full-blown serious mental illness. For example, anxiety can be very concerning and debilitating. Some behaviors associated with anxiety can even reveal and underlying psychotic process. But there is a world of difference between general anxiety disorder and schizophrenia.There are clinical descriptions of what constitutes a mental illness, but some of those behaviors and symptoms need to occur continuously over at least a six month period of time before it can be confirmed. It is also very common for diagnoses to change as more and different symptoms emerge. Psychiatrists do their best to be accurate, but they do not have any type of physical examination to determine a mental disorder. In fact, sometimes they can only come to conclusions based on what the mentally ill person admits to them. When a person with a thought disorder relays their own symptoms, their perceptions and memories could be far from accurate or objective. Further, it is also common for people to have a co-occurring diagnosis. For example, a person may have both anxiety and depression. A person diagnosed with both schizophrenia and a mood disorder is referred to as schizoaffective disorder. The term “dual diagnosis” now implies a mental illness along with a substance abuse disorder.Some medications address targeted issues, but with a misdiagnosis the side effects can be substantial. For instance, if a person initially acts depressed, they may be prescribed an anti-depressant. If the person actually has bipolar disorder, the anti-depressant could propel the person into a manic episode. Most of us have heard the commercials on TV with the long list of scary side-effects from medications. The wrong prescription could increase a person’s symptoms or cause completely different ones, including suicidal ideation.Roughly 20% of the general population will experience some form of psychological stress at points in their life which is significant enough to warrant professional help. Being depressed over genuinely stressful life events like divorce or job loss will eventually subside when circumstances improve and when temporary therapy or other treatments are utilized. Serious mental illness, however, needs to be managed for a life time, often with unsatisfactory results.One thing for sure is that the more we openly discuss mental illness, the less stigmatized it will become. In turn, more people will seek out treatment sooner and compliance to medication or therapy will also be more successful.Written byKartar DiamondFeng Shui consultant, author & teacher since 1992. www.FengShuiSolutions.net I also write about other metaphysical topics and mental health advocacy.Follow1 1 1 Mentall IllnessMisdiagnosisSelf MedicatingDrug UseMore from Kartar DiamondFollowFeng Shui consultant, author & teacher since 1992. www.FengShuiSolutions.net I also write about other metaphysical topics and mental health advocacy.More From MediumWhy Disconnecting Made Me Feel More ConnectedEvan McCoy in Invisible IllnessWhen Everyone Thinks You’re Overreacting, But You’re NotRuss W in Invisible IllnessThe Underestimated Ways Depression Can Enrich Your LifeCarine Ru in Invisible IllnessDoes My Inflamed Brain Make Me Suicidal?Toni Tails in SURVIVORSHow Pottery Helped Me Overcome My AnxietyDaniel A in The AscentWhat It’s Like to Know You’ll Be on Antidepressants for LifeDanielle Tcholakian in The Cut10 Quotes to Help You Find Hope During the Coronavirus PandemicCynthia Perkins, M.Ed. in Invisible IllnessAnxiety: How My First Bully Became My Oldest FriendCharlotte Buelow in The AscentAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
