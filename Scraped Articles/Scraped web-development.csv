6 Ways to Improve Your Web App’s Security Now,https://levelup.gitconnected.com/6-ways-to-improve-your-web-apps-security-now-164ff76661b8?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Programming,Technology,Software Development,Web Development,Cybersecurity","Photo by Sincerely Media on UnsplashAs developers, it’s not only our job to write code. We are responsible for delivering software that is tested, fully functional, and secure. All of these requirements are equally complex. But I feel these are not always treated equally.Application security is not always a first-class citizen. But it should be. Customers give us their data and expect us to keep it in a safe place. By leaving them vulnerable to exploitation, we risk losing our customers’ trust and their business.I write this story to help you improve your web app’s security. I will present mitigations that you can implement quickly in any web application. Therefore, I picked five of the ten most common security risks and added a dedicated chapter for Cross-Site-Request-Forgery. Each section consists of one or more vulnerabilities and multiple mitigations.Cross-Site-Request-ForgeryCross-Site ScriptingSecurity MisconfigurationBroken AuthenticationSensitive Data ExposureUsing Components with Known VulnerabilitiesCross-Site-Request-ForgeryCross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they’re currently authenticated.owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf/AttackA CSRF attack happens if an attacker can execute actions on the user’s behalf without notice.Our user logs into trustful.site.com.trustful.site.com sets a session cookie.The attacker tricks the user into navigating to evil.syte.com.evil.syte.com calls the backend of trustful.site.com.The backend application validates the session cookie and executes the request.Scary, isn’t it? Why is this possible? Cookies, by default, are sent to hostnames that match their domain value. But not all browsers check if the current webpage matches the cookies’ domain value. They use the target host of an HTTP request to determine which cookies to attach.The Domain attribute specifies those hosts to which the cookie will be sent. For example, if the value of the Domain attribute is “example.com”, the user agent will include the cookie in the Cookie header when making HTTP requests to example.com [..].tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265#section-4.1.2Thus, as long as the session cookie is valid, evil.syte.com can perform actions on the user’s behalf.MitigationsWe can do three things to mitigate the risk of CSRF:Send cookies only over secure HTTPs connections,restrict access to cookies, andprevent the browser from sending the cookie from 3rd party websites.To achieve this, set the following cookie attributes:SecureHttpOnlySameSite=strictCross-Site ScriptingCross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user.owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/AttackAn XSS attack needs two preconditions. First, the attacker must inject code into the web application. Second, the web application has to execute all scripts it gets blindly. In contrast to the CSRF attack, there’s not necessarily a third party website involved.Cross-Site Scripting attacks can involve code persisted in a database, or code injected at runtime. For the following example, we will focus on the former.The attacker inserts a malicious script into our database through a field not validated by our server.The attacker sends our user a link to trustful.site.com. He knows this page will return dangerous script.Our user clicks on the link, and unknowingly receives the malicious code snippet.The browser executes our attacker’s prepared code. The script sends sensitive information to our attacker.Are you interested in seeing an XSS vulnerability in action? Click the following link: Google XSS Game Demo. It will open a playground provided by Google and show a JavaScript alert. The text of the popup is in the URL parameter named query. We call this a reflected XSS attack because the server reflects the query parameter.MitigationsValidate all data twice. First, frontend applications need to validate all user input. Validation will decrease the risk of malicious data entering the app in the first place. Nevertheless, hackers can still call servers directly. Hence, second, we need to validate all data on the server-side, too. To mitigate the XSS risk, we need to verify every JSON or XML field’s value. These fields should only contain explicitly permitted characters and have an acceptable length.Encode all data to prevent reflected XSS attacks. The OWASP® Foundation builds appropriate libraries for both NodeJS and Java. Encoding ensures that web browsers display code instead of executing it.Tell the browser which type of resources to fetch from third-party servers. Such a content policy is a significant security improvement, as it limits the scope of an XSS attack.If you use a CDN or load resources from other servers, use the appropriate content security policy with the expected domain. Such as Content-Security-Policy: font-src https://fonts.cdn.com.If you don’t use a CDN, set the response header Content-Security-Policy with value default-src ‘none'.Security MisconfigurationSecurity misconfiguration is the most commonly seen issue. This is commonly a result of insecure default configurations, incomplete or ad hoc configurations, open cloud storage, misconfigured HTTP headers, and verbose error messages containing sensitive information.owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/An improper configuration of any component can help attackers discover security holes and identify an attack surface. In the context of web application security, a properly configured systemhides information about used components and frameworks, anddoes not permit unauthenticated and unauthorized access.The Attack Surface describes all of the different points where an attacker could get into a system, and where they could get data out.cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Attack_Surface_Analysis_Cheat_Sheet.htmlAttackInformation about a system can appear in HTTP headers and HTTP response bodies. Standard HTTP headers that contain server information are:server (Apache, NGINX),x-powered-by (ExpressJS, PHP),x-application-context (Spring Boot),via (varnish)Frameworks like ExpressJS or Spring Boot provide a default error handling mechanism. By default, both return a stack trace, if they handle an uncaught error or exception. Stack traces give an attacker a detailed impression of an application. They reveal which types and instances are in use and processed the request. With this in-depth knowledge, an attacker can launch a more sophisticated attack.Furthermore, if an application returns error messages and user input, it can be vulnerable to Reflected File Downloads (RFD). RFD will allow an attacker to build an URL to a web page, that when opened, will download a script to the user’s machine. Since the attacker controls the link, he is also in charge of the downloaded file’s content.How could such a link look like?https://search.yoursite.com/;chrome.bat?q=<encoded bash script here>An incorrectly configured server would download the reflected parameter q to a file named chrome.cmd. What do you think, how likely is it for a non-technical user to run chrome.cmd in the downloads folder?MitigationDisable component and framework-specific HTTP headers. Make it harder for a hacker to launch specific attacks.Do not expose detailed information or user info in error pages. Hide information about frameworks and application runtime and prevent reflected file downloads.Disable HTTP path parameters. Path parameters are the part of an URL that comes after a semicolon: https://search.yoursite.com/;chrome.bat. They play a vital role in RFD attacks, as they can fool the browser into downloading a binary file. Reject requests containing a semicolon, by merely returning HTTP status 404.Additionally, to limit the risk of RFDs, don’t let a browser guess the content type of an HTTP response. Always set the response header X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff.Broken AuthenticationRestrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are often not properly enforced. Attackers can exploit these flaws to access unauthorized functionality and/or data, such as access other users’ accounts, view sensitive files, modify other users’ data, change access rights, etc.owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/AttackA Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy defines which web pages are allowed to request resources from a server. Application servers determine allowance by inspecting the HTTP header Origin. This header is set by browsers and contains the current website’s domain.This means that a web application [..] can only request resources from the same origin the application was loaded from unless the response from other origins includes the right CORS headers.developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/In the image below, we can see multiple webpages sharing the same backend application. With enabled CORS policy, the server can allow requests from signup.mailinglist.com and signup.blogs.com and deny calls from signup.evil.com. These policies can also permit only a subset of HTTP methods for specific origins.Please note: An attacker may simply call an application server directly, therefore bypassing the browser and circumventing CORS policies by not setting the Origin request header. Nevertheless, configured CORS rules prevent the attacker from, i.e., building a website that looks and feels like the target application and uses the same backend.MitigationConfigure CORS headers adequately. Even if an application does not share resources with other applications or domains, you should add CORS headers to every HTTP response.In a CORS configuration, do only grant access to well-known and trusted origins. Custom HTTP headers must be configured explicitly. Additionally, in the CORS context, the value of the Content-Type header is restricted. We can circumvent this by explicitly allowing the Content-Type header.CORS Policies are defined using these HTTP response headers:Access-Control-Allow-OriginAccess-Control-Allow-MethodsAccess-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-TypeAccess-Control-Max-AgePlease be careful adding these HTTP headers. Return them only if you trust the origin. I suggest using built-in CORS support of application frameworks instead of building it from the ground up.Sensitive Data ExposureRather than directly attacking crypto, attackers steal keys, execute man-in-the-middle attacks, or steal clear text data off the server, while in transit, or from the user’s client, e.g. browser. A manual attack is generally required.owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10–2017_A3-Sensitive_Data_ExposureAttackA classic man-in-the-middle-attack allows an attacker to intercept and manipulate unencrypted HTTP messages. Even easier, if customer data is stored or cached on a shared device, i.e., in a public library, it will be available to everyone having access to this device.MitigationUse HTTPS everywhere and all the time. Period.Disable form autocompletion. On your smartphone, your browser has probably already cached your address. That is convenient because you don’t have to fill in your address all the time. But, if it would be a shared device, the automatic completion would expose your address. We can disable autocomplete by adding the attribute autocomplete=off to HTML forms or input tags.Disable resource caching by always setting these three response headers.Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidateExpires: 0Pragma: no-cacheLinks to other web pages are a security risk and can leak customer data as well. To prevent this attack called Tabnapping, we need to add an attribute to all HTML links that open new tabs:rel=""nofollow noreferrer""Using Components with Known VulnerabilitiesComponents, such as libraries, frameworks, and other software modules, run with the same privileges as the application. If a vulnerable component is exploited, such an attack can facilitate serious data loss or server takeover. Applications and APIs using components with known vulnerabilities may undermine application defenses and enable various attacks and impacts.https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/Last but not least, using outdated libraries, frameworks, and runtimes with well-known vulnerabilities is risky.MitigationsKeep all parts and dependencies of applications up to date. Package and dependency managers like npm or maven can check and show newer versions of application dependencies.ConclusionWe do not only deliver value for our customers by adding functionality to our apps. We do also provide value by protecting our customer’s data. And although we have just scratched the surface of web application security, we have identified various ways to decrease risks and improve overall security.For further information around web application vulnerabilities and more mitigations, please check out the OWASP Top Ten. 🙂OWASP Top TenThe OWASP Top 10 is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security.

Web Development Fundamentals for Beginners (Part 2: Backend),https://medium.com/swlh/web-development-fundamentals-for-beginners-part-2-backend-41da60415fac?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Web Development,Database,Web Developer,JavaScript,Programming","This post is the last of two chapter series of Web Development Fundamentals for Beginners. The first chapter was “Part 1: Frontend”.The development of a web page, or anything else that is created from code, is split into front-end and back-end development. Front-end development is all the things that are visible to users, back-end development is basically everything else.In this article, I’ll discuss the second one — Back end development, and introduce you to some of the most important scripting languages and databases in this area.At the end of this article, you should be able to:Pursue your journey of becoming a Full Stack Developer.Explain what are the roles of Languages (Scripting & Compiled) and Databases (Relational & Non- Relational) in Back End Development.Be well versed with the terms you will come across in your Web Development Journey.Your website deserves the best. After all, it is the internet advertising billboard for you and your company.First, what is back-end development?Back-end development in simple terms is all the things happening in the background that you cannot visibly see. It is mainly code that has to do with functionality and code that is being used to get data from databases. If the code is not providing any kind of user interface, it is usually considered as back-end development.Backend development, also sometimes called server-side development, which refers to developing the processes that happen on the server and are usually not visible to the users. A web UI can send requests to the backend asking to render some HTML, save user input in a database, authenticate a user, send an email, or process a payment request. Although this part of the application is transparent for the user, it’s in no way less important.This is the heart and brains of your application.Backend development languages and databasesLet’s start with a map of the backend landscape that depicts the things you should at least know about to orientate in this area.LanguagesThe picture was taken from GoogleCompared to frontend development, the choice of programming languages on the backend is much wider and you are free to one a solution depending on your use case and environment.There are many ways to classify programming languages, and we made an arbitrary decision to group them by scripting and compiled languages. Have to admit, though, that this is not completely accurate. Some of the scripting languages are actually compiled on the fly, and some compiled languages could have interpreters. This division, however, serves as a convenient starting point for our analysis.Scripting languagesLanguages that don’t require explicit compilation before execution are called scripting languages, or interpreted languages.As opposed to compiled languages, they do not produce a binary executable. Rather, the code is evaluated and run on the fly. Sometimes, scripting languages are easier to get started with, since you don’t have to write code in a strict manner required by the compiler. This, however, means that errors that could have been discovered during compilation will only become apparent during runtime.Some of the more popular scripting languages are:JavaScript using the Node.js server-side runtime. It supports its own set of JavaScript features and provides a set of API’s to satisfy backend use cases, such as working with the file system. Learning Node.js is a great choice since by learning a single language you’ll be able to work both on the frontend and the backend. Node.js has several popular frameworks, such as express, koa, or LoopBack.Python is a general-purpose programming language. It’s simple syntax and clear constructs make it quite easy to learn for beginners. Python is widely used for developing applications but has also gained significant traction for doing scientific research and working with artificial intelligence. There are currently two major versions being used: Python 2 and Python 3. One of the popular projects developed on Python is the Django content management system. Flask is a popular micro-framework for web development.PHP — another popular programming language for web applications. The language itself has a low entry barrier for beginners but also provides more advanced features for intermediate users. Some of the most popular projects created on PHP are WordPress and Drupal, with the former being arguably the most used content management system in the world. Notable frameworks are Laravel, Symfony, and CodeIgniter.Ruby — a scripting language designed to be simple and natural to read and write. The most popular development framework for Ruby is Ruby on Rails. Jekyll, a popular static website generator is built on Ruby.Compiled languagesCode written using a compiled language needs to be first compiled into a binary file before it can be executed. Although this needs an explicit extra step to be performed by the developer, it also brings additional benefits. The compiler can analyze the code for mismatches and give you early feedback about potential problems. Some compilers can also optimize the resulting bytecode for a particular platform ensuring superior performance.Although compiled languages might have a higher entry barrier than scripting languages, they are usually preferable in large projects due to the additional safety measures and more descriptive code.There’s a large selection of languages to choose from. Mentioning two important ones :Java is a high-level object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems and currently maintained by Oracle. Java designed to be portable between different platforms: the sources are compiled to Java bytecode that can be run on a Java Virtual Machine for any platform. It’s a highly mature language with a lot of different frameworks for developing web applications, the most popular being Spring. Additionally, Java can be used for developing Android applications. Although there are trends in considering Java old fashioned and inferior to other JVM languages, such as Kotlin, it is still one of the most popular programming languages. Java is extremely popular in the enterprise sector.C# is another high-level object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. Originally developed to be used on Windows, it can now be used to build cross-platform applications using the relatively new .NET Core runtime. One of the most popular frameworks for building web applications using C# is ASP.NET Core. C# is popular among companies adopting Microsoft’s technology stack.DatabasesThe photo was taken from GoogleAn important ability of most applications is to store user’s data. It is usually done using special software called database management systems (DBS). A DBS provides access to underlying data storage allowing allow the applications to store, retrieve, and update data. There are different kinds of databases optimized for different shapes and volumes of data. In this guide, we’ll have a look at the two most popular types: relational and non-relational.RelationalRelational databases store data in tables, where rows represent entries, and columns — entry attributes. Rows in different tables can be linked using foreign keys to represent relations between different types of entries. For example, if you’re building an online store, you might have a table for storing orders with columns such as “order number”, “client name” and “shipping address” where each row represents a separate order. Information about the ordered items will be stored in a different table called “order items”, with references to the order table.Most relational databases use a language called Structured Query Language (SQL) or its dialect to query or modify the data. Because of this, they are often called SQL databases.Popular relational databases are:Oracle Database is a database developed by Oracle. Due to its high scalability and powerful feature set, it’s often used by large enterprises. Its less frequently used for small and midsize projects due to its high license costs.MySQL — a free open-source database developed by a Swedish company MySQL AB and currently owned by Oracle. MySQL can use different storage engines for each table to store and use data differently. MySQL is used for a wide range of cases, however, it is very popular for web applications, especially in the so-called LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack. It also offers several paid editions for large-scale users.SQL Server also referred to as MSSQL, is a database maintained by Microsoft. It has many different editions for handling various workloads and data volumes. SQL Server is a major competitor of Oracle and is popular among Microsoft stack users.PostgreSQL — is a free open source database developed by a worldwide team of volunteers. It provides a rich set of features and is capable of handling large workloads.Non-relationalNon-relation databases store data in models other than tables. There are different models you can choose depending on your use cases, such as storing key-value pairs, documents, graph relations, or time-series.Although non-relation databases have been around for a while, they have recently experienced a surge of popularity due to simpler design and easier scaling.Non-relation databases are also referred to as NoSQL databases since most of them use their own query language instead of SQL.Database that is frequently used in web development :MongoDB is a free open-source document database that stores JSON-like objects. You can store and retrieve these objects and map them to objects in your application. It also has the usual querying and aggregation capabilities. MongoDB is a good candidate for applications where data consistency is not a primary concern.So, why is back-end development important?Without back-end development, web pages would be bland and have no functionality. All the data and information someone would want to display on their web page would have to be hand-typed onto HTML since they can’t really get it from a database without using back-end development.You can have the best looking car in the entire world, but it can’t drive or even turn on, making it unable to even do what a car is made for. Front-end is nice to have, but back-end development is what is needed and truly wanted, making it extremely important.The StartupMedium's largest active publication, followed by +723K people.

Animation using Framer-motion in React….,https://medium.com/@yudhajitadhikary/animation-using-framer-motion-in-react-2f1c56424a8a?source=tag_archive---------2-----------------------,"Framer Motion,React,Animation,Web Development,Web Design","Framer MotionHi Guys in this article we will discuss how to add animation to our React application using Framer Motion.Framer Motion is animation library for React, syntax is incredibly intuitive , it’s really simple to pickup and roam with, using just couple of lines of code instead of creating complex animation.So to get started with Framer Motion , we will actually create a book ordering portal having normal functionality like ordering book with Author name and Book name.We will show a confirmation message and popup for further book ordering after ordering book .We will go through the whole code base but we will look into the animation part not the functionality part of the application, because we want to keep our focus on animation part with Framer Motion.So let’s get started :Folder StructureSo this is the folder Structure of our code base, it’s having the basic structure of create-react-app . We have added a components folder having Components which we are using in our application. Author.js is the Author page , Books is the book page, Header.js is global component,Home.js is the Home page. Loader.js is the Loader of our application, Modal.js is the popup which will appear after displaying the order details page and lastly Order.js is the order details page of our application.We will install few npm packages before starting coding:package.jsonWe have installed few npm packages like framer-motion for animation, react-router-dom for adding routing in our application.We can install those packages by running following command on terminal of vscode:npm i framer-motion react-router-domSo let’s start with Index:Index.jsIn Index.js we are importing React from react, ReactDOM from react-dom, we have imported Index.css for styling .Then we have imported App component for rendering it in our root component, lastly we have imported BrowserRouter as Router from ‘react-router-dom’. Now inside render section we are wrapping our App component with Router , so that we can implement routing in our application.So now let’s see the index.css:Index.cssIndex.cssIndex.cssIndex.cssIndex.css is self explanatory , we have added styles according to our application requirement.Now let’s see our App.js file:App.jsApp.jsIn App.js , we are importing React,useState from react,also Route,Switch,useLocation from ‘react-router-dom’,We have imported Header,Home,Author,Books,Order and Modal component for rendering them in our application. And we have also imported AnimatePresence from framer-motion. So AnimatePresence is used to add loading animation to any div , exitBeforeEnter is used to specify that animation should be added after the previous page exits totally , this setShowModal is mainly to show and hide the Modal. onExitComplete is actually called when the page exits.So We want the popup should be disappear whenever there is a transition between pages, So we set ShowModal to false.After that we have added Routing in our application using Switch .So Route actually decide which route should have which component, such as /author will show Author component, like that we are describing all the pages of our application.So let’s start with the HomePage of our application:Home.jsHome.jsSo Home.js is our application’s HomePage. So we are importing React from react, Link from ‘react-router-dom’,motion from framer-motion, and Loader Component.So Our Homepage is having one header and a button which lands to our Author Page. To add animation to any <div> in framer-motion we have to declare it as<motion.div>. It may be any <button>,<h1> tag if we want to add animation to it we have to declare it like <motion.h1> in case of <h1>. We have few convention here which we have to follow to add styles to our divs in framer.motion. So we have declared 2 constants one is containerVariants and another buttonVariants these are called variants these are actually used in our code to add animation in our specified <motion.div>s. Variants actually tells those divs which variants they should look for to add animation on them . So we want our Home Page should come with a smooth flash , initial actually define from which style our divs should appear , we want our page should come from opacity 0 to opacity 1, initial defined the initial style for which animation should start , so we are passing hidden in initial and set the opacity to 0, and visible shows the final state of our animation which is opacity:1 and in transition we are setting it to delay:1.5 means our page will start showing it’s content after 1.5 seconds and duration :1.5 means our page content will take 1.5 seconds for completing the animation. Similarly exit defines the exit animation of our div , x with -value means the div will appear from left and +value means div will appear from right. y with + value div will appear from down and -value div will appear from top. We want our div should appear from right so we set our value x with ‘-100vw’ and transition :{ease: ‘easeInOut’} to increase the smoothness of our transition. Now we want our button to have some text shadow, box shadow with transition of popping up and down infinitely while hovering on it.To add hovering effect in button we use whileHover . We want our button will continue that popping animation until we move our cursor outside our button for that we add yoyo style to infinity (yoyo is actually a build-in style which refers to that specific popping style in framer-motion). We can also specific number of times that animation should happen on hover. In Button we are using buttonVariants and passing ‘hover’ style to the whileHover parameter in <motion.button>. and lastly we are adding loader in our application.So now let’s see the loader component:Loader.jsLoader.jsIn Loader.js , so we are using a bouncing ball as our loader in our application,So how we are creating a ball ?. We are styling our loader class div to create a ball using css if we look at our index.css file we are adding style to div with class name loader. we have given width:10px, height:10px, margin 40px , border-radius :50% and background:white , so that it takes shape like a white colored ball.Now we adding two orientation of bouncing in our ball one vertically and another one is horizontally. So how we can do this ? we are adding a button below by which we can toggle the bouncing style of the ball . UseCycle is a build-in function in framer-motion which used to add a cycle in styling of divs. The syntax of useCycle is similar to the useState in React :const [animation,cycleAnimation]=useCycle(“animationOne”,”animationTwo”)So here we are creating a const animation ,cycleAnimation is the function which is used to toggle the value of the animation , so we are passing two values in the array of the useCycle animationOne and animationTwo. So the value will toggle between this two values whenever cycleAnimation is called. Now we are sending loaderVariants as the variant in our <motion.div>. Inside loaderVariants we are passing two values animationOne and animationTwo. animationOne is having x value from -20 to 20 means it will move from right to left, so to give bouncing style in our loader we will be adding yoyo in x and y of transition and setting duration to infinity so that it never stops. So animationOne is for horizontal bouncing similarly animationTwo in vertical bouncing. The first value in animation(UseCycle) is referred as the default value .So in initial load the ball will bounce horizontally .When we click on Cycle Loader button cycleAnimation() function is called and the mode of bouncing of our loader will also toggle accordingly.So we can see how easily we can implement those complex animation in framer-motion.Now let see our Header now:Header.jsIn Header.js we are having a draggable logo and a heading. The most exciting fact about framer-motion is that we can make any of our div draggable by just adding drag in props of the div, dragConstraints are the restriction in direction means upto how much pixel in a particular direction we can drag our logo, dragElastic means our logo will return to it’s original step whenever we will drop it at any part of our screen.We actually want our logo to be draggable but not droppable so we put 0 to all the four direction and set dragElastic to 2 so that our logo returns to it’s original place after we drop the logo, this adds elasticity to our logo.So we can see how easily we can add draggable functionality to our div without writing a single javascript code.For the heading part we are adding initial to y: -250 means it will come from top , animate y: -10 , we are adding delay of 0.2 seconds and type: ‘spring’ means the text will appear like a spring and stiffness to 120 , these means, in 0.2 seconds the text will spring with a speed of 120, and if we increase the value of stiffness we will see the oscillation of our text will increase before settling. Now till see the Author file:Author.jsAuthor.jsAuthor.jsIn Author.js , we want our page should appear from right , with a flash and spring effect with a delay of 0.5 seconds and the page should exit through left with ease transition. So to achieve that we are setting the styles in containerVariants and using it as variants in the parent div to the Author page, just play with the values to get more idea about the styling.Now let’s see the Author list part , there we want to add hovering effect so that on hover it will increase in size and color of the text will also change , we have added a transition type of spring and stiffness:300 means we want size scaling of the text should appear with some spring effect.We want our Next Button should appear when an author is selected for that when ever user click on the Author name , the author gets added in books object. So we are checking whenever books.author is present the button should appear.Now we want our button should appear from left side with a spring effect so we set hidden value of nextVariants to x:-100vw and visible value to x:0 and transition :{type: ‘spring’ ,stiffness:120} same as heading in Header.The Buttons of our whole application will have same hovering effect like in HomePage. So we have just copy pasted hovering style from the Home.js to Author.js. Now let’s see the Books file:Books.jsBooks.jsBooks.jsBooks.js is the page in which user will select the book which they are going to order.It’s having same dom and animation style like Author.js .Now let’s see the order file:Order.jsOrder.jsIn Order.js , we show our user the order details, The entry animation is little bit different from other pages. We want the animation style should apply first in the parent div of the page and after 0.4 seconds it will be applied to the children divs for that reason we have added few extra lines of styles in visible part of containerVariants like transition:{ type: ‘spring’ ,mass:0.4,damping:8,when: ‘beforeChildren’, staggerChildren:0.4 }We want our parent div style should be completed before the child div animation and children animation should applied after 0.4 seconds.Damping and mass are the parameters which are used to adjust synchronization between parent and child div animation.We want our modal means popup should appear after 5 seconds of our Order page loading . So we used UseEffect to setShowModal value to true after 5 seconds using setTimeout function.Now let’s see the Modal file:Modal.jsModal.jsOur Modal will appear only when showModal is true. Our Modal component will have a flash effect for that we added visible :{opacity:1},hidden:{opacity:0} in backdrop.We want our Modal should come from top so we added hidden: { y: “-100vh”, opacity: 0 } in modal variant.We want our Modal should exit whenever route changes or whenever user goes to any other page , for that reason we wrapped our modal with <AnimatePresence exitBeforeEnter>.So our fully animated application is read. Let’s see how it looks like:HomePageAuthorPage initial StateAuthorsPage after Selecting AuthorBooksPage after selecting BookOrderPageModal of our ApplicationSo it’s just a introductory article on Framer-motion .We can do many exciting things using Framer-motion . So I suggest you to go through the official documentation of Framer-motion( https://www.framer.com/motion ) to explore more about it.I am leaving my git-hub link down below as the reference of this article :https://github.com/Yudhajitadhikary/Framer_Motion_BlogHAPPY CODING….:)Written byYudhajit AdhikaryWeb developer by profession,Photographer,Blog Writer,Singer,Pianist,Seeker of SolutionFollow2 2 2 Framer MotionReactAnimationWeb DevelopmentWeb DesignMore from Yudhajit AdhikaryFollowWeb developer by profession,Photographer,Blog Writer,Singer,Pianist,Seeker of SolutionMore From MediumA Beginner’s Guide To Vue Lifecycle HooksMatt Maribojoc in JavaScript In Plain EnglishImplementing Server Sent Events in ReactJSHelena Natanael in Tokopedia EngineeringStreams, Piping, and Their Error Handling in Node.jsKunal Tandon in Developer’s ArenaWeb Components API in a NutshellIndrek Lasn in Better ProgrammingCreate your own “Startup Name Generator” app using React NativeMadhav Bahl in The StartupReact’s Higher-Order Components (HOCs)Mayank Gupta in TechnoFunnelIntegrating Cobol with JavaScriptChristoph Schobesberger in graalvmShipping executables with your Electron appShivek KhuranaAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Web Workers For Beginners,https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/web-workers-for-beginners-57d7a389cded?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"JavaScript,Programming,Web Development,React,Webworker","JavaScript is a single-threaded language meaning that it executes code in order and must finish executing a piece of code before moving onto the next.For HTTP requests, JavaScript provides us with XMLHttpRequest which is non-blocking.But if we have a CPU intensive code in the program, it will block the main thread until it’s done, making UI unresponsive for that period. One way of solving it is to use setTimeout or setInterval. We can break the CPU intensive code into smaller parts and attach timeout with it. While it may work for smaller programs, as code complexity increases it becomes difficult to decide where to add timeout functions. What we need is a separate thread where these calculations are done, hence making the main thread free to handle UI events, manipulate DOM, or do other tasks.Web Workers to the rescueHTML5 introduced Web Worker to us. Web Workers are JavaScript programs running on a different thread, in parallel to the main thread. It allows you to put long-running and computationally intensive tasks on the background without blocking the UI, making your app more responsive. Worker utilizes a thread-like message passing between the main script and the background script to achieve parallelism.Types of Web WorkersBy creating separate threads for parallel JavaScript program Worker thread allows us to achieve multithreading. There are two types of Web Workers.⦁ Dedicated Workers: Dedicated Web Workers are instantiated by the main process and can only communicate with it.⦁ Shared Workers: Shared workers can be reached by all processes running on the same origin (different windows, browser tabs, iframes, or other shared workers).This article will only cover dedicated workers and I’ll refer to them as ‘web workers’ or ‘workers’ throughout.Getting startedWeb Workers run in an isolated thread in the browser. Hence the code they execute is contained in a separate JavaScript file and incorporated in your page by asynchronous HTTP requests. For creating a worker thread we add the following lines on our main page.var worker = new Worker(‘calculate.js’);If the “calculate.js” file exists and is accessible, the browser will spawn a new thread that downloads the file asynchronously. Right after the download is completed, it will be executed and the worker will begin. In case the provided path to the file returns a 404, the worker will fail silently.To start the worker, we have to call a postMessage() method.worker.postMessage(message, [transfer]);Here the message is the object to deliver to the worker page. A transfer is an optional array of Transferable objects (we will talk about Transferable objects in a later section).Communication between the web worker and the main page occurs by two methods the postMessage() method and the “message” event handler.postMessage can accept either a string or JSON object as its single argument. Newer browsers support a JSON object as a first parameter to the method while older browsers support just a string. When a message is sent from postMessage() the other page will receive the event as a ‘message’ event. For error handling, an ‘error’ event is passed.In the example above, main.html calls the two web workers (prime and factorial)with postMessage. I have used separate web workers for prime and fibonacci methods, both methods symbolize large computations.primeWorker.postMessage({cmd:'first50'}); fibonacciWorker.postMessage({cmd:'first100'});The worker files are themselves listening to the ‘message’ event and as soon as they receive an event they do their calculations and send the result back with the help of self.postMessage method. I have also added a third button to change the background color, it symbolizes UI changes. When you call prime or factorial from the script an independent parallel web worker thread is spawned which will work on these methods and parallelly you could make changes in UI by clicking the change background button.In the main.html file, I have added an error event listener also.fibonacciWorker.addEventListener('error', errorEvent, false);if an error occurs while a worker is executing, the ErrorEvent is fired. This interface contains three useful properties for figuring out what went wrong: filename — the name of the worker script that caused the error, lineno — the line number where the error occurred, and message — a meaningful description of the error.You must have noticed I have used “self” in prime.js and “this” in fibonacci.js, its because in the context of a worker, both “self” and “this” reference the global scope for the worker.Here if we haven’t used web workers then the browser would have frozen for the time the fibonacci and prime functions were computing and so you wouldn't be able to interact with UI at that time.Importing scripts and librariesWorker threads can import an external script using the importScripts() method. It accepts zero or more URIs as parameters to resources to import. The browser loads each listed script and executes it. Any global objects from each script may then be used by the worker. If the script can’t be loaded, NETWORK_ERROR is thrown, and the subsequent code will not be executed.importScripts(‘foo.js’); /* imports just “foo.js” */importScripts(‘foo.js’, ‘bar.js’);importScripts('//example.com/hello.js'); SubworkersWorkers may spawn more subworker thread. This is great for further breaking up large tasks at runtime. However, subworkers have some conditions of their own:⦁ Subworkers must be hosted within the same origin as the parent page.⦁ URIs within subworkers are resolved relative to their parent worker’s location. This makes it easier for workers to keep track of where their dependencies are.But while spawning subworkers we have to be cautious about not hogging too many of the user’s system resources.Embedded WorkersIf you want to create a worker script on the fly or don’t want to create separate files for workers. You can embed it all in a single page with the help of Blob and using Data blocks.With Blob(), you can “inline” your worker in the same HTML file as your main logic by creating a URL handle to the worker code as a string.let blob = new Blob([    ""onmessage = function(e) { postMessage('msg from worker'); }""]);// Obtain a blob URL reference to our worker 'file'.let blobURL = window.URL.createObjectURL(blob);The magic happens in window.URL.createObjectURL().This method creates a simple URL string that can be used to reference data stored in a DOM File or Blob object. Blob URLs are unique and last for the lifetime of your application(e.g. until the document is unloaded).Now for the clever part. The script element that does not have an src attribute or has a type attribute that does not identify an executable MIME type won’t be parsed by JavaScript(Data block). So we can write our worker code in this script tag and then use Blob to create a URL for the same.In the example above, in script id “worker-1” I have added the code for web worker and then in JavaScript parsed script created a Blob URL for the same.Transferring data to and from WorkersWhen we use postMessage we transfer data between web workers and the main page. This data is copied not shared between two pages i.e Objects are serialized as they’re handed to the worker, and subsequently, de-serialized on the other end. Most browsers implement this feature as structured cloning. This seems okay for small data transfer but for large amounts of data, this is a noticeable overhead.To mitigate this performance hit we can use a Transferrable object. With Transferable Objects, data is transferred from one context to another. It vastly improves the performance of sending data to a Worker. Think of it as pass-by-reference if you’re from the C/C++ world. However, unlike pass-by-reference, the ‘version’ from the calling context is no longer available once transferred to the new context. For example, when transferring an ArrayBuffer from your main app to Worker, the original ArrayBuffer is cleared and no longer usable. Its contents are transferred to the Worker context.To use transferrable objects the following command is usedworker.postMessage(arrayBuffer, [arrayBuffer]);The first argument is the data and the second is the list of items that should be transferred.Features available to Web WorkersWeb Workers have access only to a subset of JavaScript features due to their multi-threaded nature. Here’s the list of features:⦁ The navigator object⦁ The location object (read-only)⦁ XMLHttpRequest⦁ setTimeout()/clearTimeout() and setInterval()/clearInterval()⦁ The Application Cache⦁ Importing external scripts using importScripts()⦁ Creating other web workers⦁ Web Worker limitationsWeb Workers don’t have access to some very crucial JavaScript features:⦁ The DOM (it’s not thread-safe)⦁ The window object⦁ The document object⦁ The parent objectUse casesWeb Workers have great powers, but like the saying goes “With great power comes great responsibility”. Similarly, we should be cautious while using them. It should be preferred where background tasks have to be done in parallel to the main UI task or the tasks performed have to be hidden from the user. Some of its other use cases could be:⦁ Prefetching and/or caching data for later use.⦁ Code syntax highlighting or other real-time text formatting.⦁ Spell checker⦁ Progressive Web Apps⦁ Analyzing video or audio data.⦁ Background I/O or polling of web services.⦁ Processing large arrays or humungous JSON responses.⦁ Image filtering in <canvas>.⦁ Updating many rows of a local web database.Please Note: Due to security issues you can’t run your web workers locally on the browser. I used Web Server for Chrome, which worked great.Thanks for taking out the time to read the article.

Flutter Web and Slivers,https://medium.com/codechai/flutter-web-and-slivers-bfe88181006f?source=tag_archive---------4-----------------------,"Flutter,Flutter Web,Dart,Web Development,Cross Platform","Using slivers in flutter web!How to use slivers in Flutter Web? Hmm…All in one Flutter resource: https://flatteredwithflutter.com/flutter-web-and-slivers/Flutter Web and SliversBegin…View the demo hereWebsite: https://fir-signin-4477d.firebaseapp.com/#/We will cover briefly aboutSliversFlutter Web and SliversWhat are Slivers?As per the official doc:A sliver is a portion of a scrollable area. You can use slivers to achieve custom scrolling effects.You have possibly the entire control for implementing a scrollable area while using them. Because slivers can lazily build, they are particularly useful for scrolling through a large number of children.One of the best articles on Slivers, here.How to use Slivers?Just as you use, let’s say, SingleChildScrollView for implementing a normal scrolling behavior, in terms of Slivers, you simply wrap your children inside a CustomScrollViewCustomScrollView(  slivers: <Widget>[    const SliverAppBar(      pinned: true,      expandedHeight: 250.0,      flexibleSpace: FlexibleSpaceBar(        title: Text('Demo'),      ),    ),    SliverFixedExtentList(      itemExtent: 50.0,      delegate: SliverChildBuilderDelegate(        (BuildContext context, int index) {          return Container(            alignment: Alignment.center,            color: Colors.lightBlue[100 * (index % 9)],            child: Text('List Item $index'),          );        },      ),    ),  ],)Without slivers, you would have something like thisSingleChildScrollView(   child: Column(      mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,      children: <Widget>[         // WIDGETS                 ]              )            );Flutter Web and StreamsHow to use streams in the flutter web.

SliverPersistentHeaderAs per the docs:A sliver whose size varies when the sliver is scrolled to the edge of the viewport.Flutter Web and SliversHere, the 2nd Widget (Disappear-header Sliver) is a SliverPersistentHeader.As you scroll down, this widget sticks to the top of the page.Flutter Web and SliversSliverPersistentHeader(   pinned: true,   floating: true,   delegate: _SliverDelegate(child: _menu),),pinned: Whether to stick the header to the start of the viewport once it has reached its minimum size.floating: Whether the header should immediately grow again if the user reverses the scroll direction.delegate parameter of the type SliverPersistentHeaderDelegate.class _SliverDelegate implements SliverPersistentHeaderDelegate {  _SliverDelegate({    this.minHeight = 40.0,    this.maxHeight = 56.0,    @required this.child,  });final double minHeight;  final double maxHeight;  final Widget child;@override  Widget build(    BuildContext context,    double shrinkOffset,    bool overlapsContent,  ) {    return SizedBox.expand(child: child);  }@override  double get maxExtent => math.max(maxHeight, minHeight);@override  double get minExtent => minHeight;@override  bool shouldRebuild(_SliverDelegate oldDelegate) {    return maxHeight != oldDelegate.maxHeight ||        minHeight != oldDelegate.minHeight ||        child != oldDelegate.child;  }@override  FloatingHeaderSnapConfiguration get snapConfiguration => null;@override  OverScrollHeaderStretchConfiguration get stretchConfiguration => null;}3. SliverAppBarAs per the docs :A material design app bar that integrates with a CustomScrollView.Flutter Web and SliversAs you scroll up, the app bar disappears, and you see the list of colors only. Something just like this:SliverAppBarGood interactive demos hereSliverAppBar(  automaticallyImplyLeading: false,  title: titleWidget,  backgroundColor: AppColors.brandColor,  expandedHeight: expandedHeight,  flexibleSpace: FlexibleSpaceBar(     background: Image.asset(image.assetName),  ), ),automaticallyImplyLeading: To show the back arrow or not.title: What widget to show (e.g here Text(‘SliverAppbar’))expandedHeight: Size of the app bar when it is fully expanded.flexibleSpace: Stacked behind the toolbar and the tab bar. The image in our casefloating: (By default, false) Whether the app bar should become visible as soon as the user scrolls towards the app bar.pinned: (By default, false) Whether the app bar should remain visible at the start of the scroll view.Note: For the demo, the default properties were good enough for me :)4. SliverToBoxAdapterAs per the docs:Creates a sliver that contains a single box widget.SliverToBoxAdapter(   child: Container(     color: const Color(0xFF9b9987),     height: 300.0,     child: Center(       child: Text('SliverToBoxAdapter'),     ),   ),)Think of it as an alternative to a SizedBox, but for the sliver widgets.Flutter Web and Slivers5: SliverPaddingThis is basically, “The amount of space by which to inset the child sliver.”In the above screenshot, the white gap which you see between two widgets is the result of the SliverPadding.SliverPadding(    padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 24.0),    sliver: SliverFillRemaining(      child: Container(        color: const Color(0xFF442220),        child: Center(           child: Text(             'SliverFillRemaining',             style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),           ),        ),      ),    ),)6: SliverFillRemainingA sliver that contains a single box child that fills the remaining space.This should be the last sliver, as there is never any room for anything beyond this.In the above example, the SliverFillRemaining covers the available space.Production Tips :In case you have a list of children, consider using SliverList, as they efficiently render the children.For efficiently rendering a list inside Slivers, use SliverChildBuilderDelegate.For customizable SliverAppBar, use SliverPersistentHeader, since SliverAppbar uses this under the hood.For showing grids inside Slivers, consider using SliverGrid.If each of the child height is fixed, you may switch to SliverFixedExtentListSliverFixedExtentList(  itemExtent: 50.0,  delegate: SliverChildBuilderDelegate(    (BuildContext context, int index) {      return Container(        alignment: Alignment.center,        color: Colors.lightBlue[100 * (index % 9)],        child: Text('list item $index'),      );    },  ),)Articles related to Flutter Web:Flutter Web and StreamsHow to use streams in flutter web.

React Select — Advanced Options,https://medium.com/dataseries/react-select-advanced-options-d94c6aa1ab72?source=tag_archive---------5-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Davide Cantelli on UnsplashReact Select is a dropdown menu library for React apps.It supports many things that aren’t supported by regular dropdowns.In this article, we’ll look at how to add menus with React Select.Dropdown with Creatable ChoicesWe can create a dropdown with creatable choices by using the CreatableSelect component.For instance, we can write:import React from ""react"";import CreatableSelect from ""react-select/creatable"";const options = [  { value: ""apple"", label: ""Apple"" },  { value: ""orange"", label: ""Orange"" },  { value: ""grape"", label: ""Grape"" }];export default function App() {  const handleChange = (newValue, actionMeta) => {    console.log(newValue);    console.log(`action: ${actionMeta.action}`);  };  const handleInputChange = (inputValue, actionMeta) => {    console.log(inputValue);    console.log(`action: ${actionMeta.action}`);  };  return (    <div>      <CreatableSelect        isClearable        onChange={handleChange}        onInputChange={handleInputChange}        options={options}      />    </div>  );}to create a dropdown with creatable choices.We have listeners for change and input events to get the value that’s entered.isClearable lets us clear the choice.Fixed OptionsWe can add a dropdown with fixed options.For instance, we can write:import React from ""react"";import Select from ""react-select"";const options = [  { value: ""apple"", label: ""Apple"", isFixed: true },  { value: ""orange"", label: ""Orange"" },  { value: ""grape"", label: ""Grape"" }];const orderOptions = values => {  return (    values &&    values.filter(v => v.isFixed).concat(values.filter(v => !v.isFixed))  );};export default function App() {  const [value, setValue] =   React.useState(orderOptions([...options]));  const onChange = (value, { action, removedValue }) => {    switch (action) {      case ""remove-value"":      case ""pop-value"":        if (removedValue.isFixed) {          return;        }        break;      case ""clear"":        value = options.filter(v => v.isFixed);        break;      default:        break;    }    value = orderOptions(value);    setValue(value);  };  return (    <div>      <Select        value={value}        isMulti        isClearable={value && value.some(v => !v.isFixed)}        name=""fruit""        classNamePrefix=""select""        onChange={onChange}        options={options}      />    </div>  );}We have the options array with one entry having the extra isFixed property which we’ll check for.Then we have the orderOptions function which we’ll use to return all the options that are selected or have the selected and the options that can’t be removed.In the App component, we have the onChange function to check if the option should be removed.If isFixed is false , then it can be removed.We then pass the value of the fixed options and the ones that are selected to the value prop.Sortable MultiSelectWe can make a multi-select dropdown that has sortable entries.First, we’ve to install the react-sortable-hoc package by running:npm i react-sortable-hocThen, we can write:import React from ""react"";import Select, { components } from ""react-select"";import { SortableContainer, SortableElement } from ""react-sortable-hoc"";const options = [  { value: ""apple"", label: ""Apple"", isFixed: true },  { value: ""orange"", label: ""Orange"" },  { value: ""grape"", label: ""Grape"" }];function arrayMove(array, from, to) {  array = array.slice();  array.splice(to < 0 ? array.length + to : to, 0, array.splice(from, 1)[0]);  return array;}const SortableMultiValue = SortableElement(props => {  const onMouseDown = e => {    e.preventDefault();    e.stopPropagation();  };  const innerProps = { onMouseDown };  return <components.MultiValue {...props} innerProps={innerProps} />;});const SortableSelect = SortableContainer(Select);export default function MultiSelectSort() {  const [selected, setSelected] = React.useState([...options]);const onChange = selectedOptions => setSelected(selectedOptions);const onSortEnd = ({ oldIndex, newIndex }) => {    const newValue = arrayMove(selected, oldIndex, newIndex);    setSelected(newValue);    console.log(""Values sorted:"", newValue.map(i => i.value));  };return (    <SortableSelect      axis=""xy""      onSortEnd={onSortEnd}      distance={4}      getHelperDimensions={({ node }) => node.getBoundingClientRect()}      isMulti      options={options}      value={selected}      onChange={onChange}      components={{        MultiValue: SortableMultiValue      }}      closeMenuOnSelect={false}    />  );}We use the SortableSelect component with a few props.We have the onSortEnd prop with the onSortEnd function as its value,It just calls the arrayMove method to swap the position of the choices.options has our options.value has the selected values.components has the component for making the choices sortable.The SortableMultiValue component prevents the menu from being open or closed when the user clicks on a value to start dragging it.closeMenuOnSelect is set to false to keep showing the menu after selection.Photo by Brooke Lark on UnsplashConclusionWe can create a dropdown where we can create the choices.Also, we can prevent choices from being removed.And we can also drag and drop choices in the dropdown.DataSeriesImagine the future of dataFollow150 ProgrammingWeb DevelopmentTechnologySoftware DevelopmentJavaScript150 claps150 clapsWritten byJohn Au-YeungFollowWeb developer.

How ‘Fragments’ can help with your Web Development,https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/how-fragments-can-help-in-your-web-development-5efc4d10f9da?source=tag_archive---------6-----------------------,"JavaScript,Programming,Web Development,Front End Development,Coding","No one asks why we need possibility to write functions, it’s obvious and very helpful thing in programming. Functions help to make reusable code, it gives better modularity for your application.Why not to use the same thing in templates of components, nowadays many frameworks provide possibility to include a child component inside of a component. But it’s more like separate module, not such a function. A component has not only template, it also can have own JavaScript code, own styles, own scope, so it’s heavier and quite isolated piece.It’s why function for template was developed in Malina.js. Called “fragment”, it’s lighter than a whole component, not need to separate it into another file and it has some abilities that an usual function has like recursion and closure, because it’s compiled to a function at the end.1. Reusing a fragment of templateWhen you make a template, especially some forms, you can have repeatable blocks like buttons, inputs, some panels etc., in this case you can reuse similar fragments of template. Below a piece from js-framework-benchmark which has a range similar buttons:With fragment it can be rewritten to this:So here we declare a fragment button with 2 arguments id, name and forwarding event click from button @click. Though this piece can be done with a repeatable directive (for/each), fragments are placed not always in one line.2. ClosureAs a fragment is a function, it can be declared anywhere, e.g. inside of the loop, it means it can have closures. In an example below, fragment box has an argument text and closure-variable color from a loop, and a link to function click from the root scope @click={click(text, color)}3. RecursionA fragment can call itself that helps to make a recursion e.g. for building element trees, besides a fragment can be declared in bottom of a component, because a function in JavsScript is available on scope-level, below an example with fragment draw which calls itselfConclusionFragment is a light, reusable piece of template within a component, it can help to make more compact components with better structure.All examples you can try in online REPL, they’re stored here.Thanks for reading.LinksOnline editor REPLMalina.jsDocs for Malina.jsGist with examplesJavaScript In Plain EnglishNew JavaScript + Web Development articles every day.Follow58 JavaScriptProgrammingWeb DevelopmentFront End DevelopmentCoding58 claps58 clapsWritten byOleg NechaevFollowFollowJavaScript In Plain EnglishFollowNew JavaScript + Web Development articles every day.FollowWritten byOleg NechaevFollowJavaScript In Plain EnglishFollowNew JavaScript + Web Development articles every day.More From MediumObject Oriented Programming and the Prototype Chain in JavaScript.Camille Feghali in JavaScript In Plain EnglishBuild Mobile iOS, Android, and Web Apps Using React and Ionic, Part IIIDavid Choi in JavaScript In Plain EnglishDevelop W3C Web Components with WebAssemblynicole in CoinmonksHarnessing the Power of Integration TestsNiko MendoStart your journey into the world of React by learning these basicsAnchal Nigam in freeCodeCamp.orgForm Validation with Vuetify in a Vue AppJennifer Bland in Vue.js DevelopersHow to Convert Redux to Use React HooksMuhammad Anser in Better ProgrammingA Beginner’s Guide To JSXSadman Sakib MugdhoLearn more.Medium is an open platform where 170 million readers come to find insightful and dynamic thinking."
A Mental Model to think in TypesScript,https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/a-mental-model-to-think-in-typesscript-c5e1b319c7bf?source=tag_archive---------7-----------------------,"Typescript,JavaScript,Web Development,Software Development,Software Engineering","This article was first published at TK's blog.Photo by Manuel CosentinoOne day I came across a tweet from Lari Mazza that says“Can I make a suggestion? Types are hard to understand when you’ve only worked with JS in your life and suddenly have to learn TypeScript""As a software engineer that learned Python, Ruby, Javascript, and Clojure first, when I tried C++, it was a horror movie. I couldn’t do much, so counterproductive, and frustrating. Maybe because I was doing everything wrong and I didn’t understand types the right way.But even though I had so many problems, I could implement a bunch of algorithms and data structures.Now I’m using more and more Typescript in my day-to-today job and my side projects, I feel I’m more prepared to confront types. Actually, not confront, but use them in my favor.This post is my attempt to help developers think more in types and understand this mental model.JavaScript typesIf you’re here, you probably heard that Typescript is a superset of Javascript. If not, great, you just learned something new today. YAY!Typescript is a superset because any Javascript code is valid in Typescript, syntactically speaking. It may or may not compile depending on the Typescript compiler configuration. But in terms of syntax, it works just fine. This is why you can migrate Javascript to Typescript progressively by just replacing the .js extension with the .ts. Everything will be without type declarations (the any type), but that's another story.Also, if you code in Javascript — or any other programming language — you probably think in types:“Hm, it is a list of integers, so I’ll need to filter only the even numbers and return a new list”“This is an object, but I just need to get this string value from the property X”“This function receives two parameters. Both A and B are integers and I want to sum them”Yeah, you got the idea. We think in types. But they are just in our heads. We constantly think about them because we need to know how to handle, parse, or modify data. We need to know which methods we are allowed to use in this object type.To give a more concrete example, imagine you want to sum the price of all products. A product object looks like this:const product = {  title: 'Some product',  price: 100.00,};But now with a list of products:const products = [  {    title: 'Product 1',    price: 100.00,  },  {    title: 'Product 2',    price: 25.00,  },  {    title: 'Product 3',    price: 300.00,  }];Ok! Now we want a function to sum all the products prices.function sumAllPrices(products) {  return products.reduce((sum, product) => sum + product.price, 0);};sumAllPrices(products); // 425Just receive the products as the argument and reduce all product prices. Javascript works just fine. But while building this function you start to think about the data and how to handle it properly.The first part: products as an argument. Here you just think: “well, we’re receiving a list of some objects”. Yeah, in our heads the products are a list. This is why we can think of using the reduce method. It is a method from the Array prototype.Then we can think about the object in detail. We know that the product object has a price property. And this property is a number. This is why we can do product.price and sum with the accumulator.Recapping:products is a list of objects.As a list, we can use the reduce method, as this method a member of the Array prototype.The produce object has some properties. One of them is the price, which is a number.As a number property, we can use it to sum with the reduce accumulator.We wanted to return a number, the sum of all product prices.We are always thinking of data types, we just need to add the type annotations to make it more explicit and ask the compiler for help. Our memory is limited and the compilers are here to help us, humans.The type system will not only make our data more consistent, but it can also provide autocompletion for data types. It knows the types, so it can show the members for the data. We will take a look at this idea later. Here I just wanted to show that we think in types in our heads.Simples Types & Simple UsesSo we are ready to use some strongly typed programming languages like Typescript. We simply need to explicitly add type annotations to our data structures. It’s simple. But sometimes it’s not that easy (usually it’s not easy when you come from dynamically typed languages. You feel unproductive. It feels like a battle against types. The idea here is to make this learning curve more smooth and fun).Here we will see many examples of how to use types in Typescript. We start with easy and silly examples and progressively make it more complex while designing the mental model to think in types.As Javascript, Typescript also has basic data types like number, string, boolean, null, etc. You can find all the basic data types in the Typescript Docs.With these units of data, we can make our programs more useful. To be more practical, let’s get a simple example. A sum function.How does it work in Javascript?function sum(a, b) {  return a + b;}Is everything ok? ok.Now let’s use it:sum(1, 2); // 3sum(2, 2); // 4sum(0, 'string'); // '0string'   WTF!The first two calls are what we expect to happen in our system. But Javascript is very flexible, it lets us provide any value to this function. The last call is bizarre. We can call with a string, but it will return an unexpected result. It doesn’t break in development, but it will result in strange behavior in runtime.What do we want? We want to add some constraints to the function. It will only be able to receive numbers. That way, we narrow the possibility to have unexpected behaviors. And the function return type is also a number.function sum(a: number, b: number): number {  return a + b;}Great! It was very simple. Let’s call again.sum(1, 2); // 3sum(2, 2); // 4sum(0, 'string'); // Argument of type '""string""' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.As we type annotate our function, we provide information to the compiler to see if everything is correct. It will follow the constraints we added to the function.So the first two calls are the same as in Javascript. It will return the correct calculation. But the last one we have an error in compile time. This is important. The error now happens in compile time and prevents us to ship incorrect code to production. It says that the string type is not part of the set of values in the number type universe.For basic types, we just need to add a colon followed by the type definition.const isTypescript: boolean = true;const age: number = 24;const username: string = 'tk';Now let’s increase the challenge. Remember the product object code we wrote in Javascript? Let’s implement it again, but now with the Typescript mindset.Just to remember what we are talking about:const product = {  title: 'Some product',  price: 100.00,};This is the product value. It has a title as string and the price as number. For now, this is what we need to know.The object type would be something like:{ title: string, price: number }And we use this type to annotate our function:const product: { title: string, price: number } = {  title: 'Some product',  price: 100.00,};With this type, the compiler will know how to handle inconsistent data:const wrongProduct: { title: string, price: number } = {  title: 100.00, // Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.  price: 'Some product', // Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.};Here it breaks in two different properties:The title is a string and should not receive a number.The price is a number and should not receive a string.The compiler helps us to catch type errors like that.We could improve this type annotation by using a concept called Type Aliases. It's a way to create a new name for a specific type.In our case, the product type could be:type Product = {  title: string;  price: number;};const product: Product = {  title: 'Some product',  price: 100.00,};It’s better to visualize the type, add semantics, and maybe reuse in our system.Now that we have this product type, we can use it to type the products list. The syntax looks like this: MyType[]. In our case, Product[].const products: Product[] = [  {    title: 'Product 1',    price: 100.00,  },  {    title: 'Product 2',    price: 25.00,  },  {    title: 'Product 3',    price: 300.00,  }];Now the function sumAllPrices. It will receive the product and return a number, the sum of all product prices.function sumAllPrices(products: Product[]): number {  return products.reduce((sum, product) => sum + product.price, 0);};This is very interesting. As we typed the product, when we write product., it will show the possible properties we can use. In the product type case, it will show the properties price and title.sumAllPrices(products); // 425sumAllPrices([]); // 0sumAllPrices([{ title: 'Test', willFail: true }]); // Type '{ title: string; willFail: true; }' is not assignable to type 'Product'.Passing the products will result in the value 425. An empty list will result in the value 0. And if we pass an object with a different structure - Typescript has a structural type system and we will dig deep into this topic later - the compiler will throw a type error telling that the structure is not part of the Product type.Structural TypingStructural typing is a type of type compatibility. It’s a way to understand the compatibility between types based on its structure: features, members, properties. Some languages have type compatibility based on the names of the types, and it’s called nominal typing.For example, in Java, even if different types have the same structure, it will throw a compile error because we are using a different type to instantiate and define a new instance.class Person {  String name;} class Client {  String name;} Client c = new Person();  // compiler throws an errorClient c = new Client();  // OK!In nominal type systems, the relevant part of a type is the name, not the structure.Typescript, on another hand, verifies the structural compatibility to allow or not specific data. Its type system is based on structural typing.The same code implementation that crashes in Java, would work in Typescript.class Person {  name: string;}class Client {  name: string;}const c1: Client = new Person(); // OK!const c2: Client = new Client(); // OK!We want to use the Client type, and it has the property name, to point to the Person type. It also has the property type. So Typescript will understand that both types have the same shape.But it is not only about classes, but it works for any other “object”.const c3: Client = {  name: 'TK'};This code compiles too because we have the same structure here. The typescript type system doesn’t care about if it is a class, or an object literal if it has the same members, it will be flexible and compile.But now we will add a third type: the Customer.class Customer {  name: string;  age: number;};It not only has the name property, but also the age. What would happen if we instantiate a Client instance in a constant of type Customer?const c4: Customer = new Client();The compiler will not accept that. We want to use the Customer, that has name and age. But we are instantiating the Client that has only the name property. So it doesn't have the same shape. It will cause an error:Property 'age' is missing in type 'Client' but required in type 'Customer'.The other way around would work because we want Client, and Customer has all the properties (name) from Client.const c5: Client = new Customer();It works fine!We can go on for enums, object literals, and any other type, but the idea here is to understand that the structure of the type is the relevant part.Runtime and Compile timeThis is a much more complex topic in programming language theory, but I wanted to give some examples to distinct runtime and compile time.Basically, the runtime is the execution time of a program. Imagine your backend receiving data from a frontend form page, handling this data, and saving it. Or when your frontend is requesting data from a server to render a list of Pokemons products.Compile time is basically when the compiler is executing operations in the source code to satisfy the programming language requirements. It can include type checking as an operation for example. Compile time errors in Typescript, for example, is very related to the code that we wrote before:When the type is missing property: Property 'age' is missing in type 'Client' but required in type 'Customer'.When the type doesn’t match: Type '{ title: string; willFail: true; }' is not assignable to type 'Product'.Let’s see some examples to have a better understanding.I want to write a function to get the index of a part of the passed programming language.function getIndexOf(language, part) {  return language.indexOf(part);}It receives the language and the part that we will look for to get the index.getIndexOf('Typescript', 'script'); // 4getIndexOf(42, 'script'); // Uncaught TypeError: language.indexOf is not a function at getIndexOfWhen passing a string, it works fine. But passing a number, we got a runtime error Uncaught TypeError. Because a number doesn't have an indexOf function, so we can't really use it.But if we give type information to the compiler, in compile time, it will throw an error before running the code.function getIndexOf(language: string, part: string): number {  return language.indexOf(part);}Now our program knows that it will need to receive two strings and return a number. The compiler can use this information to throw errors when we get a type error… before runtime.getIndexOf('Typescript', 'script'); // 4getIndexOf(42, 'script'); // Argument of type '42' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.Maybe, for small projects (or small functions like ours) we don’t really see too much benefit. In this case, we know that we need to pass a string, so we won’t pass a number to the function. But when the codebase grows or you have many people adding code and more complexity, it’s clear to me that a type system can help us a lot to get errors in compile time before shipping code to production.At first, we need all the learning curve to understand types and all the mental models, but after a while, you’ll be more used to type annotations and eventually become friends with the compiler. It would be a helper, not a yeller.As we are learning about the basic difference between compile time and runtime, I think it’s great to differentiate types from values.All the examples I’ll show here can be copied and run in the Typescript Playground to understand the compiler and the result of the compilation process (aka the “Javascript”).In Typescript, we have two different universes: the value and the type spaces. The type space is where types are defined and used to enable the compiler to do all the great magic. And the value space is the values in our programs like variables, constants, functions, value literals, and things that we have in runtime.It’s good to have an understanding of this concept because in Typescript we can’t use type checking in runtime. It has a very clear separation between type checking and the compilation process.Typescript has the process of type checking the source code types and sees if everything is correct and consistent. And then it can compile to Javascript. As these two parts are separate, we can’t use type checking in runtime. Only in “compile time”. If you try to use a type as a value, it will throw an error: only refers to a type, but is being used as a value here.Let’s see examples of this idea.Imagine we want to write a function called purchase where we receive a payment method and based on this method, we want to do some action. We have a credit card and a debit card. Let's define them here:type CreditCard = {  number: number;  cardholder: string;  expirationDate: Date;  secutiryCode: number;};type DebitCard = {  number: number;  cardholder: string;  expirationDate: Date;  secutiryCode: number;};type PaymentMethod = CreditCard | DebitCard;These types are in the Type space, so it only works in compile time. After type checking this function, the compiler removes all the types.If you add these types in the Typescript Playground, the output will be only a strict definition ""use strict"";.The idea here is to really understand that the types live in the Type space and will not be available in the runtime. So in our function, it won’t be possible to do this:const purchase = (paymentMethod: PaymentMethod) => {  if (paymentMethod instanceof CreditCard) {    // purchase with credit card  } else {    // purchase with debit card  }}In compiler throws an error: 'CreditCard' only refers to a type, but is being used as a value here..The compiler knows the difference between the two spaces and that the type CreditCard lives in the Type space.The playground is a very cool tool to see the output of your Typescript code. If you create a new credit card object like this:const creditCard: CreditCard = {  number: 2093,  cardholder: 'TK',  expirationDate: new Date(),  secutiryCode: 101};The compiler will type check it and do all the magic and then it transpiles the Typescript code to Javascript. And we have this:const creditCard = {    number: 2093,    cardholder: 'TK',    expirationDate: new Date(),    secutiryCode: 101};The same object, but now only with the value and without the type.Constraints & Type NarrowingWhen we restrict what we can do, it’s easier to understand what we can do.We use types as constraints to limit the bugs in your program. To understand this concept, I’m stealing an example from Lauren Tan’s talk about Type Systems.const half = x => x / 2;How many ways does this function can fail? Imagine a number of possible inputs:[  null,  undefined,  0,  '0',  'TK',  { username: 'tk' },  [42, 3.14],  (a, b) => a + b,]And what are the results for input:half(null); // 0half(undefined); // NaNhalf(0); // 0half('0'); // 0half('TK'); // NaNhalf({ username: 'tk' }); // NaNhalf([42, 3.14]); // NaNhalf((a, b) => a + b); // NaNWe have different and unexpected results here. Here it’s clear that we want a number as the half function, do the calculation, and great, it's done! But sometimes we don't control the input or the codebase is big, or new/unfamiliar, and we're able to make these little mistakes.The idea of adding constraints to our code is to narrow the possibilities of a range of types. In this case, we want to limit the input type to a number type. It's the only type that we care about to do the half calculation. With type narrowing, we again give type information to the compiler.const half = (x: number) => x / 2;And with this new information, if we call the function with the test cases again, we have different results:half(null); // Argument of type 'null' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.half(undefined); // Argument of type 'undefined' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.(half(0); // 0half('0'); // Argument of type '""0""' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.half('TK'); // Argument of type '""TK""' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.half({ username: 'tk' }); // Argument of type '{ username: string; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.half([42, 3.14]); // Argument of type 'number[]' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.half((a, b) => a + b); // Argument of type '(a: any, b: any) => any' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.Basically the compiler will tell us that only the number type, in this case, the 0 value, is a valid input, it will compile, and allow to run the code. We narrow the input type and allow only the value we really want for this function.But are other ways to narrow the types in Typescript. Imagine we have a function that receives a parameter that can be either a string or a number.type StringOrNumber = string | number;function stringOrNumber(value: StringOrNumber) {}In the function body, the compiler won’t know which methods or properties we can use for this type. Is it a string or number? We only know about the value in runtime. But we can narrow the type using the typeof:function stringOrNumber(value: StringOrNumber) {  if (typeof value === 'string') {    // value.		// your ide will show you the possible methods from the string type		// (parameter) value: string    value  }  if (typeof value === 'number') {    // value.		// your ide will show you the possible methods from the number type		// (parameter) value: number    value  }}With an if statement and the typeof, we can give more information to the compiler. Now it will know the specific type for each if body.The IDE knows what to show for the specific type. In runtime, when the value is a string, it will go to the first if statement, and the compiler will infer that the type is a string: (parameter) value: string.When the value is a number, it will go to the second if statement and the compiler will infer that a type is a number: (parameter) value: number.The if statement can be a helper to the compiler.Another example is when we have an optional property in an object, but in a function, we need to return a value based on this optional value.Imagine we have this type:type User = {  name: string;  address: {    street: string;    complement?: string;  }};It’s a simple User type. Let's focus on the complement property. It's optional (take a closer look at the ? symbol), which means that it can be a string or undefined.Now we want to build a function to receive the user and get the length of the address complement. What about this?function getComplementLength(user: User): number {  return user.address.complement.length;	// (property) complement?: string | undefined  // Object is possibly 'undefined'.}As we see earlier, the complement can be a string or undefined. undefined doesn't really have a property called length:Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefinedWe could make something like:function getComplementLength(user: User) {  return user.address.complement?.length;}If the complement has a string value, we can call length, otherwise, it will return undefined. So this function has two possible return types: number | undefined. But we want to ensure that we only return number. So we use a if or a ternary condition to narrow the type. It will only call .length when it has real value (or when it is not undefined).function getComplementLength(user: User): number {  return user.address.complement    ? user.address.complement.length    : 0;}If it is undefined, we return the minimum length: 0. Now we can use the function with the right type design with and without the complement. Without compile and runtime errors.getComplementLength({  name: 'TK',  address: {    street: 'Shinjuku Avenue'  }}); // 0getComplementLength({  name: 'TK',  address: {    street: 'Shinjuku Avenue',    complement: 'A complement'  }}); // 12We’ll get 0 from the first function call and 12 from the second call.With this if concept, we can also use other helpers to do the same thing. We could use the in operator to verify a property from an object, a Array.isArray to verify an array, or the instanceof for any other class type.We could also use more advanced concepts like assertion function or type guards, but I’ll let these concepts to future posts.One thing that I want to dig deep into this Constraints topic is immutability.In Javascript and Typescript, we have the idea of mutable objects. If you define value in a variable, we can reassign it with another value later.let email = 'harry.potter@mail.com';email // 'harry.potter@mail.com'email = 'hermione.granger@mail.com';email // 'hermione.granger@mail.com'Now imagine you have a list of numbers. And you want to use a function to sum all of its numbers. The function looks like this:function sumNumbers(numbers: number[]) {  let sum = 0;  let num = numbers.pop();  while (num !== undefined) {    sum += num;    num = numbers.pop();  }  return sum;}You call the function passing your list and get the result. It works just fine.const list = [1, 2, 3, 4];sumNumbers(list); // 10But what happened to your list? Did the function mutate it entirely?list; // []If we use the list, it’s empty now. The pop in the sumNumbers function is a ""mutate"" function. It gets the references and removes the item from them. It's not a copy, it's the real reference.In runtime, we can use other functions or ways to do the same thing: using reduce, do a for loop without the need to pop items from the array.But using Typescript, we can provide immutability in compile time. If you are not using types, it’s possible to use a type assertion as const. Imagine this:const author = {  name: 'Walter Isaacson',  email: 'walter.isaacson@mail.com',  books: [    {      title: 'Leonardo Da Vinci',      price: 50.00,    }  ]};author.books.push({  title: 'Steve Jobs',  price: 10.00});Just an author object and then we add a new book to this author. The push method updates the book's array reference. It's a ""mutate"" method. Let's see if you use the const assertion as const:const author = {  name: 'Walter Isaacson',  email: 'walter.isaacson@mail.com',  books: [    {      title: 'Leonardo Da Vinci',      price: 50.00,    }  ]} as const;author.books.push({  title: 'Steve Jobs',  price: 10.00});// Property 'push' does not exist on type// 'readonly [{ readonly title: ""Leonardo Da Vinci""; readonly price: 50; }]'The compiler won’t compile. It gets an error on the author’s object. It’s is now readonly, and as a readonly object, it has no method called push (or any ""mutate"" method). We added a constraint to the author's object. Before it was a specific type (with all the ""mutate"" methods), and now we narrowed the type to be almost the same, but without the ""mutate"" methods. Type narrowing.To continue, let’s add types to this object. The book and the author:type Book = {  title: string;  price: number;};type Author = {  name: string;  email: string;  books: Book[];};Add the type to the author object:const author: Author = {  name: 'Walter Isaacson',  email: 'walter.isaacson@mail.com',  books: [    {      title: 'Leonardo Da Vinci',      price: 50.00,    }  ]};Add the type to a new book object:const book: Book = {  title: 'Steve Jobs',  price: 30};And now we can add the new book to the author:author.name = 'TK';author.books.push(book);It works just fine!I want to show another way to add immutability in compile time. Typescript has an utility type called Readonly.You can add the readonly for each property in an object. Something like this:type Book = {  readonly title: string;  readonly price: number;};But it can be very repetitive. So we can use the Readonly utility to add the readonly to all properties of an object:type Book = Readonly<{  title: string;  price: number;}>;One thing to keep in mind is that it doesn’t add the readonly for nested properties. For example, if we add the Readonly to the Author type, it won't add the readonly to the Book type too.type Author = Readonly<{  name: string;  email: string;  books: Book[];}>;All the properties from the author can’t be reassigned, but you can mutate the books list here (push, pop, ...) because the Book[] is not readonly. Let's see it.const author: Author = {  name: 'Walter Isaacson',  email: 'walter.isaacson@mail.com',  books: [    {      title: 'Leonardo Da Vinci',      price: 50.00,    }  ]};const book: Book = {  title: 'Steve Jobs',  price: 30};author.books.push(book);author.books;/* => *  * [ *   { *     title: 'Leonardo Da Vinci', *     price: 50.00, *   }, *   { *    title: 'Steve Jobs', *    price: 30 *   } * ] *  */The push will work just fine.So, how do we enforce a readonly to the books? We need to make sure that the array is a readonly type. We can use the Readonly, or use another utility from Typescript called ReadonlyArray. Let's see the two ways to do it.With Readonly:type Author = Readonly<{  name: string;  email: string;  books: Readonly<Book[]>;}>;With ReadonlyArray:type Author = Readonly<{  name: string;  email: string;  books: ReadonlyArray<Book>;}>;For me, both work great! But in my opinion, ReadonlyArray is more semantic and I also feel it is less verbose (not that the Readonly with an array is).What happened if we try to mutate the author object now?author.name = 'TK'; // Cannot assign to 'name' because it is a read-only property.author.books.push(book); // Property 'push' does not exist on type 'readonly [{ readonly title: ""Leonardo Da Vinci""; readonly price: 50; }]'.Great! Now we can catch mutable operations in compile time. This is a way to use the concept of adding constraints to our types to make sure they only do what is really needed.Semantics & ReadabilityAt first, I felt that Typescript could be very verbose because of the types and make the code much more complex than it should be. And it actually can. Strive for simplicity is the goal and it is difficult at the same time.This idea is very related to clean code and how we can write code to be human-readable and maintainable. Typescript is no different. Most of the cases, we don’t need super complex types. Let the simple types do the work.Another thing that I find very useful is semantic of types.Imagine you need to add a string to the sessionStorage to save it in the browser. Your function looks like this:function saveMyString(value: string): any {  sessionStorage.myString = value;}You add a type annotation to the string input and as you don’t know about the returning type, you probably add a any type.But what’s the real meaning behind this returning type? Is it returning anything?It just saves the string to the sessionStorage. It doesn't return anything. The void type was what you're looking for. As Typescript docs says: the absence of having any type at all.function saveMyString(value: string): void {  sessionStorage.myString = value;}Great, the meaning of the type is correct now. The correctness is very important in a type system. It’s a way to model our data, but also help maintain systems for future developers. Even if the developer is … you!Before we were talking about verbose code. And we can improve a lot of our code by using Typescript type inference.For some code, we don’t need to explicitly add type annotation. The Typescript compiler will understand and infer it implicitly. For example:const num: number = 1;This code is redundant. We can just let the compiler infers it like this:const num = 1;In our example earlier, we add the annotation void to the saveMyString function. But as the function doesn't return any value, the compiler will infer that the returning type is void implicitly.When I learned this, I thought with myself. But one of the biggest advantages of using Typescript (or any other type system / static type language) is types as documentation. If we let the compiler infer most of the types, we won’t have the documentation we want.But if you hover over the Typescript code in your editor (at least VS Code works like that), you can see the type information and relevant documentation.Let’s see other examples of redundant code and make the code less verbose and let the compiler works for us.function sum(a: number, b: number): number {  return a + b;};We don’t need the returning type number, because the compiler knows that a number + another number is equal to a number type, and it is the returning type. It can be:function sum(a: number, b: number) {  return a + b;};Implicit code, but with documentation, and the compiler does the work.Type inference works for methods too:function squareAll(numbers: number[]): number[] {  return numbers.map(number => number * number);};This function gets a list of numbers and makes every number a squared value. The returning type is number[], even though the result of a map is always a list, and as we have a list of numbers, it will always be a list of numbers. So we let the compiler infers this too:function squareAll(numbers: number[]) {  return numbers.map(number => number * number);};This works the same way for objects too.const person: { name: string, age: number } = {  name: 'TK',  age: 24};A person object with a string name and a number age. But as we are assigning these values, the compiler can infer these types.const person = {  name: 'TK',  age: 24};If you hover the person, you get this:const person: {  name: string;  age: number;}The types are documented here.Another benefit of type inference is that we can easily refactor our code. It’s a simple example, but good to illustrate the refactoring process. Let’s get the sum function again.function sum(a: number, b: number): number {  return a + b;};Instead of returning the sum number, we want to return ""Sum: {a + b}"". So for a = 1 and b = 2, we have the resulting string as ""Sum: 3"".function sum(a: number, b: number): string {  return `Sum: ${a + b}`;};sum(1, 2); // Sum: 3Great! But now letting the compiler infers this.// function sum(a: number, b: number): numberfunction sum(a: number, b: number) {  return a + b;};// function sum(a: number, b: number): stringfunction sum(a: number, b: number) {  return `Sum: ${a + b}`;};We just need to modify the returning value and the type inference will work. No need to think about the returning type. This is a small example, but for more complex functions, it would work too.Back to the readability part, we can use Enum. A utility that defines a set of named constants. It's a way to give more meaning to the data in your application.In your node app or a frontend app, you possibly do some fetching to request data. You commonly use a fetch object to perform a request and sometimes you need to pass the accept headers.fetch('/pokemons', {  headers: {    Accept: 'application/json'  }});fetch('/harry-potter/spells', {  headers: {    Accept: 'application/json'  }});It’s good, but we can also use an enum to separate this accept string in a constant and reuse.enum MediaTypes {  JSON = 'application/json'}fetch('/pokemons', {  headers: {    Accept: MediaTypes.JSON  }});fetch('/harry-potter/spells', {  headers: {    Accept: MediaTypes.JSON  }});And we are able to add more data related to the MediaTypes like PDF:enum MediaTypes {  JSON = 'application/json',  PDF = 'application/pdf'}With Enum, we can encapsulate data into a meaningful block of code.Recently, I was implementing a “state” React component. It’s basically a component that renders an empty state or an error state based on the request response.The UI for the empty and the error states were very similar. Only the title and the description text and the image icon were different. So I thought: “I have two ways in my mind to implement this: do the logic outside the component and pass all the information needed or pass a ‘state type’ and let the component render the correct icon and messages.”So I built an enum:export enum StateTypes {  Empty = 'Empty',  Error = 'Error'};And I could just pass this data to the component as the type:import ComponentState, { StateTypes } from './ComponentState';<ComponentState type={StateTypes.Empty} /><ComponentState type={StateTypes.Error} />In the component, it had a state object with all the information related to the title, description, and icon.const stateInfo = {  Empty: {    title: messages.emptyTitle,    description: messages.emptyDescription,    icon: EmptyIcon,  },  Error: {    title: messages.errorTitle,    description: messages.errorDescription,    icon: ErrorIcon,  },};So I could just receive the type based on the enum and use this stateInfo object with the State component from our design system:export const ComponentState = ({ type }) => (  <State    title={stateInfo[type].title}    subtitle={stateInfo[type].subtitle}    icon={stateInfo[type].icon}  />);This is a way to use an enum to encapsulate important data into a meaningful block of code in your application.Another cool feature from Typescript is optional properties. When we have properties from an object that can be a real value or undefined, we use an optional property to be explicitly that the property can be or not be there. The syntax for this is a simple ? operator in the object property. Imagine this function:function sumAll(a: number, b: number, c: number) {  return a + b + c;}But now the c value is optional:function sumAll(a: number, b: number, c?: number) {  return a + b + c;}We add the ? after c. But now we have a compiler error saying:(parameter) c: number | undefinedObject is possibly 'undefined'.We can’t sum an undefined value (well, actually in Javascript we can, but we receive a NaN value).We need to ensure that the c exists. Type narrowing!function sumAll(a: number, b: number, c?: number) {  if (c) {    return a + b + c;  }  return a + b;}If the c exists, it will be a number and we can sum all. If not, sum only the a and b values.An interesting part of this optional property is that it is a undefined not null. This is why we do this, we get a compile error:let number = null;sumAll(1, 2, number);// Argument of type 'null' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number | undefined'.As the ? operator doesn't handle the null value, choose to use the undefined type in your application and so you can still use the optional property and make the types consistent. We can use it like this:let value: number | undefined;sumAll(1, 2, value); // 3If you add a default value to the parameter, you won’t need the ? operator. Actually, the compiler will say that the Parameter cannot have question mark and initializer.function sumAll(a: number, b: number, c: number = 3) {  return a + b + c;}Optional properties not only works on variables and parameters, but also in objects.An API response is a good example of type definition and optional property together. In API responses, data can be optional. Sometimes the API sends, sometimes it has no value.How we model our types is really important for an application. If an optional property is defined as a required type, we can make our application breaks in runtime. But if we design the types correctly, we have the possible errors in compile time.Imagine we are fetching a user data and this is the way we modeled the response type:type UserResponse = {  name: string;  email: string;  username: string;  age: number;  isActive: boolean;};But in reality, the email is optional for the user. The API endpoint could return or not. But the UserResponse type we built treat it as a required property.After fetching the user data, we want to see if the user email matches with a specific domain.function matchDomain(email: string) {  return email.endsWith(domain);}As the email property is required in the UserResponse type, the email parameter will also be required in the matchDomain function.This is the runtime we can get if the email is undefined:// Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'endsWith' of undefinedBut what would happen if we modeled the UserResponse correctly?type UserResponse = {  name: string;  email?: string;  username: string;  age: number;  isActive: boolean;};Now the email is possibly undefined and it is explicit.But if we still keep the function matchDomain the same way, we get a compile error:// Argument of type 'undefined' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.And this is great! Now we can fix the email parameter in this function using the ? operator:function matchDomain(email?: string) {  return email.endsWith('email.com');}But now we get a compile error when running email.endsWith, because it could be undefined too:// (parameter) email: string | undefined// Object is possibly 'undefined'.Type narrowing! We use an if block to return a false when the email is undefined. And run endsWith method only if the email is really a string:function matchDomain(email?: string) {  if (!email) return false;  return email.endsWith('email.com');}It’s pretty nice when we can get runtime errors in compile time. Better to code than debugging after we ship in production, isn’t it?Type compositionType composition is very useful when trying to reuse existing types for new places of the codebase. We don’t need to rewrite new types, we can create a new type by composing existing ones.One example of composition I always have to handle using Redux or the useReducer hook from React is the idea of ""reducers"". A reducer can always receive a number of different actions.In this context, actions are objects with at least a type property. It looks like this:enum ActionTypes {  FETCH = 'FETCH'}type FetchAction = {  type: typeof ActionTypes.FETCH;};const fetchAction: FetchAction = {  type: ActionTypes.FETCH};A fetchAction has a type FetchAction that has a property type that is a typeof FETCH.But a reducer can receive other actions too. For example a submit action:enum ActionTypes {  FETCH = 'FETCH',  SUBMIT = 'SUBMIT'}type SubmitAction = {  type: typeof ActionTypes.SUBMIT;};const submitAction: SubmitAction = {  type: ActionTypes.SUBMIT};For a specific container, we can compose all these actions into just one type and use it for the reducer parameter type.It would look like this:type Actions = FetchAction | SubmitAction;function reducer(state, action: Actions) {  switch (action.type) {    case ActionTypes.FETCH:    // fetching action    case ActionTypes.SUBMIT:    // submiting action  }}All the possible actions are the Actions type. And we use a union type to ""join"" all action types. The action in the reducer can have the FetchAction or the SubmitAction.As a Potterhead, I couldn’t miss a Harry Potter example. I want to build a simple function to choose a Hogwarts House based on the person trait. Let’s start with the houses first.type House = {  name: string;  traits: string[];}const gryffindor: House = {  name: 'Gryffindor',  traits: ['courage', 'bravery']};const slytherin: House = {  name: 'Slytherin',  traits: ['ambition', 'leadership']};const ravenclaw: House = {  name: 'Ravenclaw',  traits: ['intelligence', 'learning']};const hufflepuff: House = {  name: 'Hufflepuff',  traits: ['hard work', 'patience']};const houses: House[] = [  gryffindor,  slytherin,  ravenclaw,  hufflepuff];I want to keep it simple, so the House type has only the name and the traits, a list of possible traits from people related to the house.And then, I create each house and added all of them to the houses list.Great! Now I’ll build the Person type. A person can be a witch or a muggle.type Witch = {  name: string;  trait: string;	magicFamily: string;}type Muggle = {  name: string;	trait: string;  email: string;}And this is the part we combine these two different types using the union type:type Person = Muggle | Witch;Using the intersection type, the Person type has all properties from Muggle or all from Witch.So now, if I create a Muggle, I need just the name, the trait, and the email:const hermione: Muggle = {  name: 'Hermione Granger',	trait: 'bravery',  email: 'hermione@mail.com'};If I create a Witch, I need the name, the trait, and the magic family name:const harry: Witch = {  name: 'Harry Potter',  trait: 'courage',  magicFamily: 'Potter'};And if I create a Person, I need at least the name and the trait properties from Muggle and Witch:const tk: Person = {  name: 'TK',  email: 'tk@mail.com',  trait: 'learning',  magicFamily: 'Kinoshita'};The chooseHouse is very simple. We just pas the houses and the person. Based on the person trait, the function will return the chosen house:function chooseHouse(houses: House[], person: Person) {  return houses.find((house) => house.traits.includes(person.trait))}And applying all the people we created:chooseHouse(houses, harry); // { name: 'Gryffindor', traits: ['courage', 'bravery'] }chooseHouse(houses, hermione); // { name: 'Gryffindor', traits: ['courage', 'bravery'] }chooseHouse(houses, tk); // { name: 'Ravenclaw', traits: ['intelligence', 'learning'] }Nice!The intersection type is a bit different, but it can also be used to combine existing types.When I was implementing a web app to apply my studies on UX, I needed to create a prop type for the Image component.I had the type ImageUrl from the product type:type ImageUrl = {  imageUrl: string;};And the ImageAttr to represent all the attributes for the image:type ImageAttr = {  imageAlt: string;  width?: string};But the props expected all this information in the component. Intersection type for the rescue!type ImageProps = ImageUrl & ImageAttr;Simple as that. So now, the component needs all these properties. The type looks like this:type ImageProps = {  imageUrl: string;  imageAlt: string;  width?: string};And we can use this type this way:const imageProps: ImageProps = {  imageUrl: 'www.image.com',  imageAlt: 'an image',};const imagePropsWithWidth: ImageProps = {  imageUrl: 'www.image.com',  imageAlt: 'an image',  width: '100%'};Nice! One more concept to reuse and compose types.I also find the Pick type very interesting and useful. We have other interesting types that we could write here, but the idea here is to understand that we can compose type and there is no limit to reuse types. If you're interested in study other types, take a look at this post I wrote: Typescript Learnings: Interesting Types.ToolingWhen you npm install typescript, you don't just get the compiler, you get the language service API, a standalone server called tsserver that editors can run to provide autocompletion, go-to, and other cool features.These features are what some people from the Typescript team call developer productivity tools like smart errors when type checking and IntelliSense (code completion, hover info, signature information). We look at these features throughout the whole article, but I want to make a special topic to talk about it.The Typescript type checker is powerful in the sense that it can infer types and provide information to some possible issues. Example: It inferred that the city is a string. And the uppercase is used the wrong way. As it knows it is a string, it also tries to find a possible method that the engineer is looking for.const city = 'Tokyo';city.toUppercase();// Property 'toUppercase' does not exist on type// 'string'. Did you mean 'toUpperCase'?In this case, the compiler is really smart, because it finds exatcly what we wanted.It also works for objects:const people = [  { name: 'TK', age: 24 },  { name: 'Kaio', age: 12 },  { name: 'Kazumi', age: 31 },];for (const person of people) {  console.log(person.agi);  // Property 'agi' does not exist on type '{ name: string; age: number; }'}With the static types, the tooling can provide a great developer experience with code completion, hover info to show defined types, and signature information for methods and other data.If you type: 'TK'., the editor will show all the possible methods for the string object. The compiler knows it is a string. And it knows the methods from the String prototype. But it also provides the method signature. This is very interesting because we don't necessarily need to go to the docs. The ""docs"" is already in our code editor.It’s an awesome experience while coding.The type definition “on hover” is another thing that we saw earlier in this article. Let the compiler infer the types implicitly and you won’t lose the type documentation. Using the hover in the object, the IDE or editor will always be able to show the type definition.Another interesting thing is that Typescript will not only flag what could go wrong on runtime, but it also helps to find code that doesn’t do what you intend.Imagine we have a function to open a snackbar if it is still closed. It would verify the status of the snackbar. If it is closed, just call another function to open it.const buildSnackbar = (status: SnackbarStatus) => {  if (status.isClosed) {    openSnackbar();  }};And the type information for this snackbar is:type SnackbarStatus = {  isClosed: boolean;};What happens if I call this function like this:buildSnackbar({ isclosed: true });It won’t break in runtime, because the status object has no isClosed attribute and the undefined object is a falsy value, so it will skip the if condition and not call the openSnackbar function. No runtime error. But probably it will behavior different than the expected.In Typescript, the compiler will give some hints to make it works properly. First it will show this error:// Argument of type '{ isclosed: boolean; }' is not assignable to// parameter of type 'SnackbarStatus'.isclosed with downcased C is not assignable to the type. It's not defined there. This is the first hint to make you correct your code.The second is even better:// Object literal may only specify known properties,// but 'isclosed' does not exist in type 'SnackbarStatus'.// Did you mean to write 'isClosed'?It tells exactly what you probably need to do: rename the isclosed to isClosed.We can talk a lot of things about the tooling about I think this is the main part.My suggestion to learn more about this is to just code in Typescript and “have a conversation” with the compiler. Read the errors. Play with the hover. See the autocompletion. Understand the method signatures. It’s really a productive way to code.Tips & LearningsAs the article is coming to an end, I want to just add the final thoughts, learnings, and tips to help you in your journey learning Typescript or just applying it in your projects.Really read the type error: this will help you better understand the issue and the types.strictNullChecks and noImplicitAny can be very helpful in finding bugs. Enable this as soon as possible in your project. Use strictNullChecks to prevent “undefined is not an object”-style runtime errors. Use noImplicitAny to type the source code to give more type information for the compiler.Together with these compiler’s configurations, I always recommend being very precise about your types. Mainly with the values that occur only in runtime like an API response. Correctness is important to catch as many bugs as possible in compile time.Understand the difference between runtime and compile time: types only affects in compile type. It runs the type checker and then compiles to Javascript. The Javascript source code doesn’t use any type of references or type operations.Learn about utility types. We talk about more specific about the Readonly in the immutability in compile time, but Typescript has a box of helpers like Required, Pick, and many more.If possible, prefer letting the compiler infers the types for you. Most of the types and returning types are redundant. The Typescript compiler is very smart in this topic. If not possible, you can always add type annotations. And let the type assertions as to the last option.As writing code, take a look at the tooling. The design of the tooling provided in an IDE is amazing. The IntelliSense and type checking provide a really good experience.ResourcesI compiled (pun very much intended!) a bunch of resources to help you learn more about programming languages, type systems, and the type mental model.Also, if you found the examples on this post useful, I added all of them this repository: Thinking in Types.

Web Assembly & the future of internet,https://medium.com/@siddharth.lakhara/web-assembly-the-future-of-internet-82e6d95dcd4e?source=tag_archive---------8-----------------------,"Web Development,Webassembly","IntroductionWeb assembly, or WASM for short, is a low level, assembly like language that can be run on browsers. Web assembly itself is not a new language, however it gives a compilation target for several low level languages like C/C++ and Rust. An application written for web assembly runs on the browser and provides near native performance.In simpler words, web assembly allows to run client side applications inside the browser. Something which was not possible till now. To establish an analogy, consider WASM as the byte code of JVM. Just like byte code can be converted to native machine code, WASM, converts code running inside browser to native application code. So, we can theoretically run all desktop apps in the browser!In a nutshell, the following diagram represents a typical flow of WA code:Trends in web development industryWeb Assembly 1.0 is successfully shipped and supported by 4 major browsers now. i.e. Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE. Web assembly is one more step toward bringing a native application experience for a cloud application. Web worker, HTTP/2, IndexDB, QUIC protocol and PWA are related technologies.How to get startedCurrently, WebAssembly needs to be loaded and compiled by JavaScript.Basically, four steps are needed:Load the wasm bytesCompile them into a moduleInstantiate the moduleRun the function(s)If you want to get your hands dirty on the tech, head over to https://webassembly.studio/Future of the internetOne might wonder, the effects of WASM on the current state of internet which is heavily dominated by Javascript. For that, in my opinion, WA will only enhance Javascript rather than hurt it.

"<strong class=""bs"">JavaScript: Object Oriented Programming (OOP)</strong>",https://medium.com/@jonathan_wong/javascript-object-oriented-programming-oop-b5be855401c4?source=tag_archive---------9-----------------------,"JavaScript,Programming,Software Development,Coding,Web Development","Before we get into Object Oriented Programming or OOP, let’s tackle what an object is, first. Think of objects in JavaScript as an object in real life. Take for example, your phone. Your phone has properties such as color, weight, and so on. Objects in JavaScript or other programming languages are the same as well. They both have properties which make up what they are.const phone = new Object()phone.color = ‘Grey’phone.weight = “3 pounds”phone.brand = ‘Apple’console.log(phone)If you console.log phone, you’ll get the properties listed. If you wanted to list a specific property, just type phone.(specific property). For example, console.log(phone.color) would return Grey. You could also type in console.log(phone[‘specific Property’]) or in this case, console.log(phone[‘color’]) for the same result.Let’s talk about some other ways you could create an object in this case. You could create an object in this manner as well.const phone = { color: “Grey”, weight: “3 pounds”, brand: “Apple”}If you wanted to create a new object, you could just create a new variable name with the same properties. For example:const phone2 = { color: “Rose Gold”, weight: “2 pounds”, brand: “Apple”}Now let’s discuss OOP. In its simplest definition, it’s a programming paradigm focused on objects rather than functions as the name suggests. It may help you to think of OOP as a way to creating and using a blueprint to create objects. At least, that’s how I think of it. You may be asking yourself what’s the point of OOP or why should you consider using it. Well, there are several reasons! OOP can lead to one’s code to being more modular. In OOP, we have something called a class and in a class, we can build methods designed to interact with objects. Look below for a basic example.class Phone { constructor(color, weight, brand) {  this.color = color;  this.weight = weight;  this.brand = brand; }  phoneColor() {  return `The phone is ${this.color}` }  phoneWeight() {  return `The phone is ${this.weight}` } phoneBrand() {  return `The phone’s brand is ${this.brand}` }}const phone1 = new Phone(‘grey’, ‘3 pounds’, ‘Apple’)console.log(phone1.phoneColor())console.log(phone1.phoneWeight())console.log(phone1.phoneBrand())Now look at the last two lines and try running this code.Let’s now look at the four pillars of OOP. They are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.· Encapsulation· Abstraction· Inheritance· PolymorphismEncapsulationEncapsulation refers to the bundle of data and methods onto one unit. This allows for reusability for functions more securely. For example look at the code above. The properties are only visible to the scope of the class and the functions phoneColor, phoneWeight, phoneBrand, are visible to whoever calls the function.AbstractionAbstraction allows us to create a model out of something more complex. Think about your phone for example, when you go on Instagram and like or comment on a photo. There’s a lot of complexity and logic going on in the background that you’re not privy to. Another example would be a coffee machine. Say, you were using a coffee machine to make coffee. There are a lot of things going on inside the machine that you may not know is going on. You as the user, probably doesn’t care about what’s going on in the machine. You just want the coffee. Essentially, it hides unnecessary information/detail and just gives us what we need.InheritanceInheritance refers to how classes can inherit methods or properties from other classes in a hierarchal structure. In OOP, there is something called a parent class and a sub class or child class. The sub class or child class inherits from the parent class. Another way we can describe this is saying the sub class extends to the parent class.PolymorphismPolymorphism means many forms. In terms of programming, it specifically refers how sub classes inherit all of the properties from a parent class but can also have their own specific properties. For example, let’s think about a teacher and the students inside a classroom. They have many characteristics in common, such as name, age, and so on. However, students may have their own characteristics that a teacher doesn’t, such as grade.ConclusionIn summation, OOP is a programming paradigm focused around objects. OOP isn’t specific to JavaScript but this is an example of its design in JavaScript. The best analogy or way to think of OOP, is that it’s essentially a blueprint for creating objects.

10 Tricks for Writing CSS & HTML Faster,https://codeburst.io/trick-to-write-css-html-100x-faster-5edd8299e600?source=tag_archive---------10-----------------------,"Web Development,Web Design,Website,HTML,CSS","Photo by Greg Rakozy on UnsplashWeb-designers are constantly on the hunt for tools to help them to reduce the time it takes to carry out various tasks. One of the most time-consuming aspects of writing a clean web interface has always been writing CSS & HTML. While pre-coded templates can save time during the development process, it’s worth asking whether it’s possible for web-designers to code more efficiently from scratch. Well, what if I told you that there is a way to significantly increase the speed at which you write CSS & HTML? Let me introduce you to Emmet.What is Emmet?Emmet is a free add-on for your text editor that allows you to type shortcuts that are then expanded into full pieces of code. By using Emmet, web-designers type less, saving both keystrokes and time when building websites. Also, relying on Emmet’s auto-completion means fewer typos and missing tags, leading to more robust websites.Emmet is available for a variety of text editors and is built right into Visual Studio Code & Vim, and can be downloaded as a plugin for Atom, Sublime, Eclipse e.t.c.Let’s stop the litany and learn through practiceNote : For this tutorial, we’re going to be using VS Code, since Emmet is already built right in. If you want to follow along in another supported IDE, check out the Emmet downloads page to install it.1. Boilerplate HTML structure (!)Just write an exclamation (!) in your file and hit ENTER.!Output :<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=""en""><head>    <meta charset=""UTF-8"">    <meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"">    <title>Document</title></head><body></body></html>oh…. no need to thank me.2. Building Elements (>)Simply type in the tag name or tag names separated by greater-than (>) sign.#Single tagdiv#Nested tagsdiv>ul>liOutput :#Single tag<div> </div>#Nested tags<div>    <ul>        <li></li>    </ul></div>I have a feeling you’ve mastered it already just by looking at this code snippet.3. Siblings (+)To add tags one followed by the other use plus (+) sign.div+p+bqOutput :<div></div><p></p><blockquote></blockquote>4. Climb Up (^)Enables climbing of tags above tags, use caret (^) symbol.div+div>p>span+em^bqOutput :<div></div><div>    <p><span></span><em></em></p>    <blockquote></blockquote></div>fun fact caret (not carrot ) is also known as circumflex symbol.5. Multiplication (*)Let’s get your skills multiplied.Multiply any element / tag by using asterisk (*) followed by the number of times you want to replicate it.ul>li*5Output :<ul>    <li></li>    <li></li>    <li></li>    <li></li>    <li></li></ul>6. Grouping (())Group specific tags using braces ( ) .div>(header>ul>li*2)Output :<div>    <header>        <ul>            <li></li>            <li></li>        </ul>    </header></div>7. ID (#) & Classes (.)Period(.) sign indicates class while Pound(#) represents id.div#header+div.pageOutput :<div id=""header""></div><div class=""page""></div>8. Custom attributes ([ ])Place an attribute within square braces ([attribute = ]) to build custom attributes.td[title=""You're Awesome""]Output :<td title=""You're Awesome""></td>9. Item Numbering ($)Item name followed by a dollar sign ($) represents a single item.ul>li.someitem$*5Output :<ul>    <li class=""someitem1""></li>    <li class=""someitem2""></li>    <li class=""someitem3""></li>    <li class=""someitem4""></li>    <li class=""someitem5""></li></ul>10. Generating a “Lorem Ipsum”For times when you are lost.To generate random text use lorem followed by the number of words you wish to add.div>p>h4>lorem10Output :<div>    <p>        <h4>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Soluta, fugiat?</h4>    </p></div>Let’s mix & match :Example:article.fun>img.fun-img+h3.fun-title{title text}+h4.fun-quote>lorem8Output :<article class=""fun"">    <img src="""" alt="""" class=""fun-img"">    <h3 class=""fun-title"">title text</h3>    <h4 class=""fun-quote"">Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.</h4></article>BONUSfor all the CSS beastsm10 → margin:10px;p10 → padding:10px;d:f → display:flex;ai:c → align-items:center;jc:c → justify-content:center;w:a → width:auto;h:a → height:auto;ConclusionAbove I have listed a number of methods that you can use to speed up your writing.

Material UI — Slider,https://medium.com/dev-genius/material-ui-slider-d08100891180?source=tag_archive---------11-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development","Photo by Bruce Warrington on UnsplashMaterial UI is a Material Design library made for React.It’s a set of React components that have Material Design styles.In this article, we’ll look at how to add sliders with Material UI.Discrete SlidersWe can add sliders to snaps to discrete values.To do that, we set the marks prop to true .For instance, we can write:import React from ""react"";import Slider from ""@material-ui/core/Slider"";export default function App() {  return (    <form>      <Slider marks />    </form>  );}to make an uncontrolled slider that snaps to the nearest 10.Small StepsWe can change the steps with the steps prop.For example, we can write:import React from ""react"";import Slider from ""@material-ui/core/Slider"";export default function App() {  return (    <form>      <Slider step={0.00001} marks />    </form>  );}to change the increment between each discrete value.Custom MarksWe can add our own custom marks with the marks prop.For example, we can write:import React from ""react"";import Slider from ""@material-ui/core/Slider"";const marks = [  {    value: 0,    label: ""0m""  },  {    value: 25,    label: ""25m""  },  {    value: 50,    label: ""50m""  },  {    value: 75,    label: ""75m""  },  {    value: 100,    label: ""100m""  }];export default function App() {  return (    <form>      <Slider step={10} marks={marks} valueLabelDisplay=""auto"" />    </form>  );}We add the marks array with the value and label properties in each entry to show the labels with the text in the label property.Restricted ValuesWe can restrict values to the ones that are in the marks array by setting step to null .For example, we can write:import React from ""react"";import Slider from ""@material-ui/core/Slider"";const marks = [  {    value: 0,    label: ""0m""  },  {    value: 25,    label: ""25m""  },  {    value: 50,    label: ""50m""  },  {    value: 75,    label: ""75m""  },  {    value: 100,    label: ""100m""  }];export default function App() {  return (    <form>      <Slider step={null} marks={marks} valueLabelDisplay=""auto"" />    </form>  );}Now we can only select the values that are marked in the marks array because of the null value we passed into the step prop.Make Label Always VisibleWe can make the labels always visible by setting the valueLabelDisplay prop to on .For example, we can write:import React from ""react"";import Slider from ""@material-ui/core/Slider"";const marks = [  {    value: 0,    label: ""0m""  },  {    value: 25,    label: ""25m""  },  {    value: 50,    label: ""50m""  },  {    value: 75,    label: ""75m""  },  {    value: 100,    label: ""100m""  }];export default function App() {  return (    <form>      <Slider step={10} valueLabelDisplay=""on"" marks={marks} />    </form>  );}Now we see the value above the slider dot.Range SliderWe can allow users to select a value range with the Slider .To do that, we can set an array as the value as the initial value.For example, we can write:import React from ""react"";import Slider from ""@material-ui/core/Slider"";export default function App() {  const [value, setValue] = React.useState([20, 30]);  const handleChange = (event, newValue) => {    setValue(newValue);  };  return (    <form>      <Slider valueLabelDisplay=""auto"" value={value} onChange={handleChange} />    </form>  );}to make a range slider.We set an array as the initial value of the value state to make the slider a range slider.Vertical SlidersWe can make a slider vertical with the orientation prop set to vertical .For instance, we can write:import React from ""react"";import { makeStyles } from ""@material-ui/core/styles"";import Slider from ""@material-ui/core/Slider"";const useStyles = makeStyles({  root: {    height: 300  }});export default function App() {  const classes = useStyles();  return (    <div className={classes.root}>      <Slider        orientation=""vertical""        valueLabelDisplay=""auto""        defaultValue={30}      />    </div>  );}to create a vertical slider.We’ve to set the height of the wrapper so that the slider is displayed.TrackWe can set track to false to remove the track that’s displayed when we select a value.To do that, we write:import React from ""react"";import Slider from ""@material-ui/core/Slider"";export default function App() {  return (    <div>      <Slider track={false} defaultValue={30} />    </div>  );}to remove th track.We can also set it to inverted to change the track to be opposite of the default.Non-Linear ScaleThe scale is linear by default, but we can change it to a nonlinear scale with the scale prop set to a function.We can write:import React from ""react"";import Slider from ""@material-ui/core/Slider"";export default function App() {  return (    <div>      <Slider scale={x => x ** 5} defaultValue={30} />    </div>  );}to change the scale.Photo by Sierra St John on UnsplashConclusionWe can add sliders to let users select a number or a range of numbers from a slider.Dev GeniusCoding, Tutorials, News, UX, UI and much more related to developmentFollow173 Sign up for Best StoriesBy Dev GeniusThe best stories sent monthly to your email. Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

Revisiting color in design,https://uxdesign.cc/revisiting-color-design-53d5b139d1b1?source=tag_archive---------12-----------------------,"Design,Colors,Web Design,Web Development,UI","Having focused on learning the development aspect of web development over the past year, I find it refreshing to revisit the design portion of the field.The enlightenment came from a recent chance conversation with a senior engineer, who was looking for a developer with a keen eye for visual consistency.Here are some takeaways from the Color Design course I just completed on Codecademy.Color Theory99designsAssuming that we’ve already forgotten about the color wheel in art classes, it is composed of three color groups:Primary colors: red, blue and yellowSecondary colors (mixing two primary colors): green, orange and purpleTertiary colors (mixing primary and secondary colors):Red-orange (Vermillion)Yellow-orange (Amber)Yellow-green (Chartreuse)Blue-green (Teal)Blue-purple (Violet)Red-purple (Magenta)All colors on the color wheel have warmth values, namely warm (ranging between red and yellow) and cool (range between blue, purple and green).To create a wider range of colors, we can also use tints (adding white) and shades (adding black) to our color palette.Speaking of color palettes, there are generally four color schemes we can use to achieve harmony on the website:via CodecademyMonochromatic: Using the same base colorComplementary: Showing high contrast in color-pairingAnalogous: Apply three or more colors that are adjacent to each other on the color wheelTriadic: Creating a triangle of colors within the color wheelLast but not least, we should also account for color psychology, which refers to how colors trigger a user’s emotional responses. For instance, the color red evokes passion and danger, while the color blue is often associated with calmness.UI StatesGal ShirWhen applying colors to UI design, we need to take into account different states, or user actions, on the targeted component of the website.For instance, the two common states of user interaction on a button are the hover state and the disabled state.Similarly, form inputs also have several states:default: when the page loads, before user interactionactive, or selected: when the user highlights a field (usually achieved by changing border color)disabled: indicates the field cannot be edited (grayed out)Accent vs. Semantic ColorsWhile it’s important to have a clear, dominant brand color for our website, we can also use different visual signals in our color palette to reflect the content hierarchy or any special indicator.Accent colors are used when we want to draw the user’s attention. For instance, a call-to-action button or form inputs.Semantic colors provide additional indications to the user when something goes right or wrong. Some common designs for such indicators are red alerts, green submission success, and yellow warnings.AccessibilitySmashing MagazineFinally, to make sure our UI components are accessible, we should provide additional indicators other than colors to convey information.For example, in addition to using the color green to indicate submission success, we should add a text label (“success!”) or checkmark icon.There are also plenty of accessibility checking tools we can leverage, such as Color Safe, Adobe Color Accessibility, and Cloudflare.I hope this post gives you a brief overview or quick refresher on color design. In terms of determining color schemes, my personal favorite has been Colormind.io. Is there any resource you use regularly for color selections or references?

Animating Your React Components,https://levelup.gitconnected.com/animating-your-react-components-8af7615ea61f?source=tag_archive---------13-----------------------,"React,CSS,JavaScript,Animation,Web Development","Image by Carl Joseph from unsplash.comSo, you want to take your React components to the next level? Implementing animations can greatly improve the customer experience and make your app feel more professional. Animations are one of many ways to accomplish this. In this article, I want to go through how you can easily animate your React components using framer-motion.How to get startedTo set up your project to use framer-motion you can simply install it by using your JavaScript package managers like NPM or Yarn. Run any of the following commands inside of your React.js project and you will be ready to go.$ npm install framer-motion$ yarn add framer-motionDifferent types of animationsSo, in framer-motion there a couple of different types of animations that you can use as tools to animate your components. Here are the ones we are going to cover in this article. You can also find much more information on the official framer-motion documentation site here.Animating a single componentAnimating component mounts and unmountsAnimating between component statesAnimating multiple componentsAnimating a single componentSo a good place to start trying out animation in React is to simply animate a single component. To do this, we will use the motion component provided by the framer-motion package. This lets us replace our default html divs with motion.div, and therefor get exposed the possibility to easily animate them. To animate a component in a x-axis, we can write the following.import React from 'react'import { motion }from 'framer-motion'const MyComponent = ({ children }) => (  <motion.div animate={{ x: 500 }}>    {children}  </motion.div>)And by using our component like this:import MyComponent from ""../components/component"";export default function App() {  return (    <MyComponent>      <h3>This will animate</h3>    </MyComponent>  );}The output will look like this and it will animate directly when it mounts.A black text saying “This will animate” coming out from the left in a fast “bouncy” transitionAlthough this might not seem like a very useful animation, this is just the basic concept of animating a React component. Now we will use our learnings to further develop our React components to use more complex animations to animate between states and mounts. Starting off, let us animate a component between being visible and not visible.Animating presenceAnimating presence can be done in a couple of different ways. We will do this by just slightly updating our previous component, and in our parent component where we will add the AnimatePresence component provided by framer-motion to animate between mounting and unmounting from the dom. This most accurately represents how you most likely use your React components today. We will update our component to look like this:import { motion, AnimatePresence } from ""framer-motion"";export default function MyComponent({ children }) {  return (    <motion.div      initial={{ opacity: 0 }}      animate={{ x: 250, opacity: 1 }}      exit={{ opacity: 0, x: 500 }}    >      {children}    </motion.div>  );}By adding the initial prop, updating the animate, and adding the exit prop we will ensure that the AnimatePresence component knows exactly how to animate this component when it mounts and unmounts from the dom. If we do not supply proper values the animation may not work. Now, to animate our component when it mounts and unmounts from the dom, we need to update our parent component a little bit.import { useState } from ""react"";import { AnimatePresence } from ""framer-motion"";import MyComponent from ""../components/component"";export default function App() {  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState();  return (    <div>      <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(!isOpen)}>        Toggle component      </button>      <AnimatePresence>        {isOpen && (          <MyComponent>            <h3>This will animate</h3>          </MyComponent>        )}      </AnimatePresence>    </div>  );}Now, this is what our component should look like. When clicking the button the first time, the component is going to animate onto the page, and when clicking it again it is going to animate out from the page. Since we specified our initial, animate, and exit props on our component, framer-motion now knows how to animate it between its different states.A button being clicked toggling a black text saying “This will animate” coming out from the left in a fast “bouncy” transition. When clicking the button again it continuous its transition to the right and then disappears.Animating between component statesNow, let us say your component itself has different local states — and when it changes you want your element to animate. We can accomplish this by using the motion element together with the layout property. We will try this out by creating a fairly usual but important component — a Switch.import { motion } from ""framer-motion"";export default function Switch({ isOn, onToggle }) {  const styles = {    wrapper: {      display: ""flex"",      justifyContent: isOn ? ""flex-end"" : ""flex-start"",      borderRadius: 50,      width: 60,      padding: 4,    },    handle: {      height: 25,      width: 25,      background: ""#fff"",      borderRadius: ""50%"",    },  };return (    <motion.div      style={styles.wrapper}      onClick={() => onToggle(!isOn)}      animate={{ background: isOn ? ""#006aff"" : ""#ddd"" }}          >      <motion.div layout style={styles.handle} />    </motion.div>  );}And by using it like this in our parent component:import { useState } from ""react"";import Switch from ""../components/switch"";export default function App() {  const [isOn, setIsOn] = useState();  return <Switch isOn={isOn} onToggle={() => setIsOn(!isOn)} />;}A switch component on a blank page that’s being animated between a on and off state by clicking on it. When in the on state the switch has a blue background, and when in the off state it has a gray background.Animating multiple componentsSo, with our newly gathered knowledge on how to easily animate React components, we will now bring it all together to animate a more real world example with multiple components. Framer-motion certainly has a lot more features than we are going to cover in this article — but these examples will definitely help you kickstart your journey towards animating React components.Example: Animating notificationsWe will create a new component in our project called Notification, and from there we will start combining what we have learned to animate several notifications in a layout in a professional manner.Here is the code for the new component. It is going to use the motion element with the initial, animate, and exit props to accomplish to the desired transition when mounting and unmounting from the dom.We are also going to apply the layout prop to make sure AnimatePresence knows that each component should be aware of its siblings to create smooth height adjustments to the wrapper.import { motion } from ""framer-motion"";export default function Notification({ title, description, onClose, id }) {  const styles = {    wrapper: {      boxShadow: ""0px 5px 30px 0px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)"",      borderRadius: 5,      padding: 16,      margin: ""1rem 0"",    },  };  return (    <motion.div      layout      initial={{ opacity: 0, x: 200 }}      animate={{ opacity: 1, x: 0 }}      exit={{ opacity: 0, x: 200 }}      style={styles.wrapper}    >      <h2>{title}</h2>      <p>{description}</p>      <button onClick={() => onClose(id)}>Close</button>    </motion.div>  );}And to use the component we will add this to our parent component:import { useState } from ""react"";import { AnimatePresence } from ""framer-motion"";import Notification from ""../components/notification"";export default function App() {  const [notifications, setNotifications] = useState([]);  const pushNotification = (notification) => {    setNotifications([...notifications, notification]);  };  const styles = {    notifications: {      top: 0,      right: 0,      position: ""fixed"",    },  };  return (    <div>      <button        onClick={() =>          pushNotification({            title: ""Test notification"",            description:              ""This is a test notification that is being animated using framer-motion"",            id: Math.random(),            onClose: (id) => {              setNotifications((currentNotifications) =>                currentNotifications.filter(                  (notification) => notification.id !== id                )              );            },          })        }      >        Push notification      </button>      <div style={styles.notifications}>        <AnimatePresence>          {notifications.map((notification) => (            <Notification {...notification} key={notification.id} />          ))}        </AnimatePresence>      </div>    </div>  );}Voila! We have now built a way to animate notifications coming in on the page. This greatly enhances to experience for the user, compared to the notifications just appearing and disappearing from the page without any sort of transition. Just by supplying a few props and wrapping our components in a AnimatePresence we achieved this. This is really only scratching the surface of what animation libraries like framer-motion can do.What is next?Depending on your position in the industry, animations might not be the most important part of your product. For example, if you are bootstrapping a startup or building a very corporate software, animating every single React component might not be a very good return on investment (ROI). But if your work on a larger company where customer experience is greatly valued, or you are building your own startup and is really focused on design, animating your components can definitely enhance the customer experience and the general feel of your app.Animation really depends on the audience. If you are building an app for kids, then this is more or less a necessity. On the other hand — if you are building something for elderly people or for people with certain disabilities, you should consider reducing the amount of motion on your app. There are a lot of great resources on the web on how to manage this and make sure every user gets the most pleasant experience. Thank you for reading, and good luck with your journey of animating React components!Level Up CodingCoding tutorials and news.Follow54 ReactCSSJavaScriptAnimationWeb Development54 claps54 clapsWritten byAlbin GroenFollowHi!

Announcing the Official Release of Appwrite Deno SDK,https://itnext.io/announcing-the-official-release-of-appwrite-deno-sdk-75bebba03bfe?source=tag_archive---------14-----------------------,"Web Development,Nodejs,Deno,Programming,JavaScript","We are extremely excited to announce the official release of the Appwrite Deno SDK beta version. The new SDK joins our Node, PHP, Ruby, and Pythons server-side SDKs that allow you to extend your Appwrite functionality from your backend.What is Deno?If you’re new to Deno, you should know that Deno is a new runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript based on the V8 JavaScript engine and the Rust programming language. It was created by Ryan Dahl (the original creator of Node), and its main focus is on productivity. Unlike most coding languages, Deno explicitly takes on the role of both runtime and package manager within a single executable. When using Deno, you don’t have to install packages or dependencies. You have to declare them in your script, and Deno will resolve them in your script runtime.What is Appwrite?Appwrite is a 100% open-source `backend as a service` packaged as a set of scalable and easy to deploy Docker containers. Appwrite provides you with a set of easy to use, must-have API, and tools to allow you to build your new projects a lot faster. We have lots of pre-built security features like file-encryption, auto-generated SSL, rate-limiting, and many more.Getting StartedThe new Appwrite Deno SDK is written in Typescript and allows you to directly integrate with your Appwrite services and APIs from your Deno backend.Getting started with the new SDK is extremely easy; all you need to do is import the latest SDK version from your code, set your Appwrite credentials, and start making API calls. Below is a simple example:import * as sdk from ""https://deno.land/x/appwrite/mod.ts"";let client = new sdk.Client();let users = new sdk.Users(client);client    .setEndpoint('https://[HOSTNAME_OR_IP]/v1') // Your API Endpoint    .setProject('5df5acd0d48c2') // Your project ID    .setKey('919c2d18fb5d4...a2ae413da83346ad2') // Your secret API key;let promise = users.create('email@example.com', 'password');promise.then(function (response) {    console.log(response);}, function (error) {    console.log(error);});Docs and ExamplesAppwrite official documentation siteTo learn more about how to use the new Deno SDK, you can visit the official Appwrite documentation. We have also released a new dedicated Deno Playground repository with useful code examples that can help you get a good look and feel for how you can use the new SDK for Appwrite.CreditsThis is an excellent opportunity to thank Appwrite community members, Ali Almoullim and Punit Diwan, for helping to build and test the new Deno SDK for Appwrite. Without their fantastic support, this release was not possible.ITNEXTITNEXT is a platform for IT developers & software engineers…Follow129 Web DevelopmentNodejsDenoProgrammingJavaScript129 claps129 clapsWritten byEldad A.

A Complete Guide to LocalStorage in JavaScript: Part-2,https://medium.com/swlh/a-complete-guide-to-localstorage-in-javascript-part-2-115ecae5e00c?source=tag_archive---------15-----------------------,"JavaScript,Web Development,Front End Development,Data,Programming","Before starting this article, I want to take a moment to thank you guys for so much loving and support to the first part of this article, I got an amazing response on that and many people texted me saying it was amazing and they are eagerly waiting for the second part.So yes, your wait is over, and lets get started!Let’s recapitulate what all we have covered —So last weekend, I released the first part of the article, “A Complete Guide to LocalStorage in JavaScript: Part-1” in which I introduced you with the theoretical details of the JavaScript localStorage, which were as follows —What is localStorage?Methods and Properties provided by Storage ObjectBrowser compatibility with localStorageLimitations of localStorageIf you want to read the full article, here’s the link —A Complete Guide to LocalStorage in JavaScript: Part-1In this short, to the point article, I’ll will guide you through the complete theoretical explanation and practical…medium.comWhat are we going to do?I have been thinking a lot about the project idea that we can build together in order to have a good understanding of how localStorage works.And yes, I got this amazing idea of building a ‘LOCAL TAPAS MENU’.here‘s how it looks…Project SpecificsThrough this project you guys are going to learn about two thing:Local StorageEvent DelegationIn this project, you can add dishes in the menu, you can check in and check out the dishes and whats cool thing about this is that even if you refresh your page, you see that your menu items are still there.This means that we are going to persist our state using localStorage.Whats Event delegation?, and why are we using this in out project?Event delegation is a simple technique by which you add a single event handler to a parent element in order to avoid having to add event handlers to multiple child elements.In our project we have to use event delegation because when we add a dish in the Local Tapas menu, we also want to check in and check out the dish, which means we are trying to create an ‘onClick’ event listener on a element which is not even created. And you know that if an item doesn’t exist, in future you can not click in it. This problem will be addressed using the JavaScript Event Delegation.To view the live project, you can follow this link: DemoDevelopment is On!First I’ll present the gist of HTML and CSS file used in the project. You might not face any problem understanding it. All the logic for localStorange and Event Delegation is implemented in the JS file.I’ll explaining all the concepts involved in the js file.HTML StructureCSS StylingJS — The logic behind everything …So what’s Happening ?Okay, so let’s go through the JS file displayed above. There are three main functions that are taking care of everything:addItem(…)populateList(…)toggleDone(…)Before I go on explaining the complete function, first let me talk a bit about this JSON.parse(…)[line 3] and JSON.stringify(…)[line 46]In localStorage, data is not saved in the same format as it is used in JS code. In you browser, open Browser tools > Storage > Local Storage and you will find this —We see that the data is stored in key: value pair. Value contains the name of the dishes that we have entered with done status.JSON.parse()The JSON.parse() method parses a string and returns a JavaScript object.[line 3]: In this line, we are checking if items already exist in the browser or not.It exists, then convert it into JavaScript object and display that, else return [].JSON.stringify(…)Whenever we add anything to localStorage we need to convert it into string, this is where JSON.stringify(…) comes into picture.[line 46]: JSON.stringify(…) is going to convert our object of arrays into JSON stringsFunctions —addItem(…): It’s called whenever a user adds a new dish. It pushed the new dish in the array of items and calls populateList(…) to re-render new array of items.populateList(…) : It’s rendering the complete array of items.toggleDone(…): It’s taking care of the check in and check out functionality and also calls populateList(…) to re-render the array whenever it encounters a change.Congratulations!! You have successfully developed a JavaScript project implementing LocalStorage!ConclusionWe did it! If you followed along with me through this whole tutorial, you should have a really good feel for localStorage now. To summarize, we have divided the article into two parts. The first part deal with the theoretical understanding and conceptual details of how to implement localStorage in JavaScript. The second part(this article) covers the implementation and in-depth explanation of localStorage and also develop a cool Project.This article should have given you a good understanding of localStorage in JavaScript. There is much more to learn and improve, but I hope you feel confident delving in and playing around with localStorage yourself now.View Source on GitHubWiki of the repositoryPlease let me know if anything was unclear, or if there’s anything else you’d like to see in this or a subsequent article.

13 Semantic HTML Elements You’ve Probably Never Heard Of,https://codeburst.io/13-semantic-html-elements-youve-probably-never-heard-of-fa1d49f93225?source=tag_archive---------16-----------------------,"HTML,Web Development,Web,Programming,Coding","With the abstractions that modern front-end frameworks provide, it’s easy to dismiss plain old HTML as a thing of the past — a mere starting point that necessarily leads to “bigger and better” options. Developers with intimate knowledge of HTML are becoming rarer, and at the same time, experts in accessibility and progressive enhancement are needed like never before.Despite its lack of “cool factor,” HTML is a dynamic tool that is very much alive and evolving. In fact, developers have been using the lessons learned from building front-end applications to improve HTML itself, and as the language evolves so too does its potential. When it comes to cleaner, more deliberate development strategies, HTML can be used to replace functionality commonly generated with a hodgepodge of div and span elements, CSS overrides, and React abstractions.So without further ado, here are a bunch of semantic HTML elements to help you on your quest to build a better web. If you’ve used these elements before, then congratulations. You are a hero and the web needs you. If these elements are new for you, then consider this an invitation to dive further into the intricacies of HTML.Note: many of these elements have polyfills to support older browsers, but always consult the documentation before using them.1. <area>, <map>The <area> element, used within a <map> element, defines a specific region of an image, and optionally associates it with a link. Using these elements, you can create links around certain parts of an image.2. <base />The <base> element creates the root URL to use relative URLs in an HTML document. It can even be accessed within scripts using document.baseURI.<head>   <base href=""https://www.myurl.com/"" /></head> <body>   <a href=""suburl"">Visit https://www.myurl.com/suburl</a> </body>3. <cite>The Citation element defines a reference to a cited creative work.<img src=""the_alchemist_cover.jpg"" alt=""The Alchemist Book Cover""> <p>  <cite>The Alchemist</cite> by Paulo Coelho. Published in 1988.</p>4. <datalist>The <datalist> element contains a list of <option> elements that represent key recommended terms for other fields. Take a look at the example below where an <input/> component can be augmented with search-like functionality without the need for JavaScript.5. <details>The Details element is basically the native HTML version a dropdown UI component. Additional information is displayed when the element is toggled into an “open” state.6. <dialog>The HTML <dialog> element represents an interactive component such as a dismissable warning.<dialog open>This is an open dialog window</dialog>7. <dd>, <dt>, <dl>These elements provide descriptions, definitions, or values for items in a description list. Newer browsers automatically format terms and definitions with logical indentation.<dl>   <dt>George Michael</dt> <dd>80's Musician</dd> <dt>Madonna</dt>    <dd>90's Musician</dd> </dl>8. <dfn>The Definition element is used to indicate the term being defined within other content. The nearest parent element is the definition for the indicated term.<p>  <dfn>HTML</dfn> is the standard markup language for creating web pages.</p>9. <hgroup>The <hgroup> element wraps a multi-level heading, grouping a set of h1- h6 elements.<hgroup>   <h1>Main Header</h1>   <h2>Subheader</h2> </hgroup>10. <kbd>From MDN: “The <kbd> element represents a span of inline text denoting textual user input from a keyboard, voice input, or any other text entry device. By convention, the user agent defaults to rendering the contents of a <kbd> element using its default monospace font, although this is not mandated by the HTML standard.""<p>Press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to copy text.</p>11. <mark>The <mark> element defines text that is highlighted for reference or notation purposes<p>This is not that important. <mark>But this is</mark>.</p>12. <meter>The HTML <meter> element creates a visual representation of a fraction or percentage.<label for=""completion"">Completion</label> <meter id=""completion"" value=""2"" min=""0"" max=""10"">2 out of 10</meter>13. <progress>The HTML <progress> creates a visual representation of the progress of an action.<label for=""file"">Downloading progress:</label> <progress id=""file"" value=""32"" max=""100""> 32% </progress>ConclusionThese are just some of the many ways that semantic HTML can be used to streamline your code. A more thorough understanding of HTML and the possibilities it presents can help developers ensure front-end applications work well for as many users as possible. So don’t forget about HTML. You may come to regret it in a couple of years when your React application is outperformed by leaner, simpler projects that make use of the latest HTML and vanilla JavaScript have to offer.Further Reading: The Future of Web ComponentsSemantic HTML elements aren’t the only tools you should be paying attention to. Web Components are a new technology within HTML and vanilla JavaScript that allows developers to create and use their own HTML elements and encapsulate their functionality away from surrounding HTML code.

Немного слов о том как это было.Год назад я решил записать серию подкастов на тему использования Angular, но сразу с толкнулся с проблемой, что часть используемых мной решений, не так глубоко освящена в официальной документации Angular, а также в сопутствующих библиотеках, утилитах и технологиях таких как Ngrx, Nx, Universal, NativeScript и Bazel.И поэтому я решил по быстрому (как потом окажется и одного года мало) заполнить все пробелы.Как всё начиналосьЯ начал с базового стека: Nx+Angular + Universal.Это привело к написанию первой статьи — Angular Universal & Nx monorepo. Статья получилось достаточно объёмной, и поэтому я отказался от идеи в двух статьях рассказать про весь современный фронтенд.Я потратил чуть меньше недели на написание первой статьи. После публикации в течении долгого времени, было примерно 2 просмотра в день и 0 прочтений. Как говориться, могло быть и хуже :)На момент написания второй статьи Angular и Nx имели разные правила к проверке кода. И статья — Приводим Angular код в порядок с помощью Prettier, tslint и eslint, стала логичным продолжением.Целый год статья была с ошибкой в названии, где некто приводил все в “прорядок”.И так как Angular Team всё время принимает компромиссы между функциональностью и нативностью. До сих пор* существует проблема с работой с веб хранилищами в Universal. Третья статья рассказывала об решении данной проблемы — LocalStorage, SessionStorage для Angular Universal.В то время, я ещё не так сильно погрузился в ядро и принципы Angular. И поэтому в статье есть много чрезмерных enterprise подходов, которые мало эффективны. Если я бы писал статью сейчас, руководствуясь enterprise практиками Nx, то я бы не стал создавать абстрактные хранилища, и всё разбил бы на независимые модули и библиотеки.Конечно, немного поработав в продакшене, я и команда пришли к мнению, что обычная обертка над хранилищами не нужна, так как это в результате приведёт только к одному — рассинхронизации данных. Для того, чтобы этого не происходило, нужен один сервис/фасад, который будет контролировать данные.Следующей проблемой стала локализация. Хоть angular и предоставлял решение из коробки, локализация с помощью ngx-translate было гораздо проще и удобнее (до некоторых пор). В статье — Internationalization в Angular с помощью ngx-translate, я делился своим видением. Сразу скажу, что так делать не нужно. В следующей статье, посвящённой локализации, я постарался исправить все допущенные ошибки — Мультиязычность ngx-translate в Angular 9 c монорепозиторием Nx.Год использования ngx-translate в проде привело к пониманию и осознанию проблем, с которыми встречается разработчик при локализации. Я отказался от ngx-translate в пользу стандартной локализации Angular. Но до сих пор, есть определённый пласт проблем при её использовании, например, в Universal.Последним важным технологическим аспектом был — Redux. И в Angular все не так однозначно. Влияние React и Vue привело к созданию нескольких реализаций Redux, но эталонной считается Ngrx. И поэтому в статьях— Redux в Angular с помощью Ngrx или создание Store в Angular и Организация Stat’ов в Angular или как создавать Ngrx feature, я рассказываю об организации State’ов.Хорош Ngrx или нет, вопрос спорный. Единственный совет — попробуйте все решения и выберите наиболее подходящий.И так как Angular не хочет использовать чудесный тестовый фреймворк Jest, пришлось написать несколько статей, связанных с тестированием с помощью Jest — Тестирование Ngrx State в Angular с помощью Jest.Так как я не QA, мои советы могут быть вредны, поэтому используйте их после консультации со специалистом.О этот дивный фронтендПосле написания ключевого набора статей, началось то, что свойственно всему фронденду — Всё устарело и изменилось. И я начал переписывать статьи, так как они потеряли актуальность.Angular & Universal изменили принципы сборки серверного приложения. Пришлось актуализировать статью и выпустить — Angular 9, Universal и Nx. Новые правила сборки SSR приложения.Затем, уже я переосмыслил работу с веб-хранилищами и обновил статью — Кроссплатформенные web storage в Angular 9. Но сделал это не в полном объёме, и поэтому будет ещё одна итерация с приведением материала к Nx стилю.Так как Angular 9 выкатили удобоваримую локализацию, грех было пройти мимо и не поделиться своим мнением в статье — Локализация в Angular 9 с помощью @angular/localize с universal.В это же время, мне понадобился простенькая сборка одной HTML странички и я накидал быстренький webpack конфиг и решил им поделиться — Сборка Typescript приложения с помощью Webpack.Конечно, с обновлением документации Ngrx и Nx, я старался актуализировать и статьи связанные с Redux — Redux в Angular. Управление состояниями в Angular с помощью Ngrx и Nx. Структура и подходы к организации экшенов, селекторов, редьюсеров и эффектов в Ngrx и Nx.Было несколько статей посвящённых вёрстке и её интеграции с Angular. Но так как современный фронтенд говорит нам, что используйте нативные решения и не используйте готовые решения на подобии Twitter Bootstrap, то актуализация данных статей была предана забвению.А потом пришло время релиза на моей основной работе и всё остановилось.Но он прошёл успешно и теперь есть время всё отрефакторить и переписать :)Что будет дальше с F.A.F.N.U.RЕсли обобщить статистику, то получим следующее (просмотры, прочтения, процент прочтения, лайки):В целом, результаты нормальные, если не считать, что 4 и 5 человек не читают, того что я написал.Минус — всё это приносит ноль рублей, а забирает много времени. Делать блог платным на medium я не буду, так как сам никогда не платил за какой либо образовательный контент. Можно сделать ссылку на донаты, но это плохой путь (по крайней мере до тех пор, пока кто-то не попросит об этом).Для монетизации я рассматриваю частные консультации по проекту, но пока нет большого спроса на это.Ещё немного цифр о медиа, которые не стоило бы писать, но как есть:Нас в Vk— 5 человек;В цифровом концлагере Fb грущу один;В официально разрешенном Telegram — 11 человек;В Twitter — 15 человек.Всем честно отвечаю, кто задает вопросы на любых платформах. Так что добавляйтесь.ПланыНа данный момент, основной стек описан, за исключением подхода к правильной темизации с помощью Angular (применение pipe’ов и diretive’в).В ближайшее время я займусь записью подкаста посвящённого разработке enterprise приложения. Предметная область будет либо платформа для трейдинга, либо небольшое банковское SPA приложение.Так как основной репозиторий стало трудно поддерживать, есть сильное желание сделать все по новому, согласно всем канонам.Также получаю запросы на то, где посмотреть полноценные проекты на Nx, но к сожалению открытых проектов очень мало.Новый проект, позволит понять весь дух Nx.Можете в комментах оставить свои пожелания и замечания относительно предметной области, а также всего блога в целом.Спасибо, что читаете блог. Если бы не вы, я бы давно бросил это дело!СсылкиПодписывайтесь на блог, чтобы не пропустить новые статьи про Angular, веб-разработку и новости из мира фронтенда.Medium: https://medium.com/fafnurДобавляйтесь в группу ВК: https://vk.com/fafnurДобавляйтесь в группу в Fb: https://www.facebook.com/groups/fafnur/Телеграм канал: https://t.me/f_a_f_n_u_rTwitter: https://twitter.com/Fafnur1Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/fafnurLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/fafnurПредыдущие статьи:Архитектура enterprise Angular приложений с использованием монорепозитория Nx.Angular тестирование component с помощью Jest.CSS решения.

Servis sağlayıcılar, veri aktarımını farklı yöntemlerle yapabilirler (kablosuz, elektrikle, uydu üzerinden, telefon hattından, fiber kablodan). Bu yüzden gelen sinyalleri veriye dönüştürmek için modeme ihtiyacınız vardır.Modem ÇeşitleriKullanacağınız modem, bağlantı türünüze göre değişir. Kablolu TV hattı üzerinden internet bağlantısı alacaksanız kablo modeme, VDSL üzerinden alacaksanız bir VDSL modeme ihtiyacınız olacaktır.Ancak modem, tek başına sadece bir cihazı internete bağlayabilir. İşte bu noktada router’lar devreye giriyor.Modem ve Router Arasındaki FarkModem, evinizle internet arasındaki köprüyü kurarken router, eviniz içinde yerel ağı oluşturma görevini üstlenir. Router sayesinde ağdaki her cihaz, veriyi doğru noktaya gönderir ve diğerlerinin işine karışmaz.Modem ve router’ın bir diğer farkı, modemin tek bir IP alması ve router’ın farklı cihazlara farklı IP’ler atamasıdır.RouterÇeşitli ağ problemleri ile karşılaştınız ve araştırmalarınız sonucunda yolunuz ‘router’ kelimesine mi düştü? Oldukça karmaşık olan ağ bileşenleri tanımanız için yazımızda sizler için router nedir, ne işe yarar, nasıl kurulur sorularına cevap verdik ve size uygun olan router’ı seçebilmeniz için açıklamalarda bulunduk.Türkçe kullanımı ile ‘yönlendirici’ olarak adlandırılan router, iki ağı birbiriyle güvenli bir biçimde haberleştirmek için kullanılan donanımsal cihazlardır. Farklı ağlar arasındaki iletişimi sağlayan routerların, bilgi alışverişine olanak tanıyan paketlerin istasyondan istasyona taşınmasında büyük bir rol oynadığını söyleyebiliriz.Evinizde veya işyerinizde kullandığınız modemlerin de bir router olduğunu varsayarsak yerel ağınız tarafından size verilen ip adresini, internet ortamında gezinebilmek için kullanılması gereken iplere atayan güvenlikli cihazlar olduğunu söyleyebiliriz.Kullanıcıların internet deneyimlerinde yaşadıkları bağlantı problemleri, oyun oynarken yaşadıkları gecikme sorunları ve bağlantılarındaki hız sorunlarıyla alakalı araştırma yaptıkları ve sonucunda keşfettikleri routerların arkasında yatan önemli bilgileri gelin hep birlikte inceleyelim.Router nedir?Router, internet ortamında gezinebilmeniz için size kimlik atayan cihazlardır. Kimlik atamaktan kastımız, IP konusunda size yardımcı oluyor ve kullandığınız cihazın, ağ trafiğinde akıcı ve güvenli bir şekilde yolunu bulmasını sağlıyor. İnternet sağlayıcınızın size temin ettiği ağ trafiğinin bir parçası olmanızı sağlayan routerlar, kablolu ve kablosuz yayınlar yaparak telefon, bilgisayar ve akıllı cihazların internete erişimini sağlıyor.Router ne işe yarar?İnternet sağlayıcınızın kendi serverlarından kablolarla evinizin önüne kadar getirdiği ve oradan da dairenizdeki hatlara çekilen internet servisini, kişisel cihazlarından kullanmanızı sağlar. Modemden sonraki ilk ana parça olan routerlar, hepimizin bildiği ethernet kablosu, Wi-Fi alanları ve internet şifresi gibi terimlerin tam ortasında bulunuyor. Kısaca güvenlik bakımından da sorumlu olan routerlar, sizin dünyaya açılmanıza olanak tanıyan en önemli ürünlerden bir tanesi.Router nasıl çalışır?Routerların da küçük bir bilgisayar olduklarını belirtmek isteriz. Bünyesinde işlemcisi ve belleği bulunan cihaz, size tahsis edilmiş IP adresini ayrıştırarak kablolu-kablosuz bağlantı kuran cihazlara internete erişmek için bir IP verir. İnternette dolaşırken bu kimlik üzerinden dolaştığınızı düşünürsek film ve dizilerde bahse konu olan ‘IP adresiyle yer tespiti’ bu şekilde işlemektedir. Her cihaz internete erişmek için bir kimlik sahibi olmak zorundadır ve routerlar bu konuda size yardımcı olmaktadır.Router ve modem farkları:Modemler, aboneliğiniz olduğu internet sağlayıcılarından gelen bilgileri işleyen yapıdır. Önceki yazımızda bahsettiğimiz gibi routerlar tek başına internete ulaşmak için yeterli değildir ama onlar sayesinde, kullandığınız akıllı aletleri internete eriştirebilir veya oluşturduğunuz yerel ağlar arasındaki haberleşmeyi sağlayabilirsiniz. Yaygın kullanım olarak ülkemizde de modemler, router olarak tasarlanıp kullanıma sunulmuş bir vaziyette. Böylelikle farklı iki cihaz karmaşasından sıyrılıyor ve basit bir kullanım imkanı kazanıyorsunuz.Router ve network alt bileşenleriRouterların kullanım alanlarına göre şekillenmiş çeşitleri olduğunu ekleyelim. Bunlardan en yaygın olanları Access Point (erişim noktası) ve Repeater (tekrarlayıcı) olarak karşımıza çıkıyor. Access Point, adından da anlaşılacağı üzere bir erişim noktasıdır. Modem ve router sırasından çıkmış olan interneti, iç mekanlarda uçtan uca ulaştırmak için kullanılır.Genellikle büyük işyerlerinde tercih edilen network donanımı, kablolu ve kablosuz sinyal alımı yapabilen ve kablolu-kablosuz yayın yapabilen cihazlardır. Bünyesinde DHCP bulundurmayan access pointler, IP değiştirme imkanı bulundurmayarak bir router görevi göremezler fakat, halihazırda bulunan routerların kapsama alanını genişletmek için önemli bir rol oynarlar.Router nasıl kurulur?Routerların küçük bir bilgisayar olduğu anolojisine dayanarak bir güç kaynağından gerekli olan enerjiyi temin etmesi gerektiği söyleyebiliriz. Adaptöründen güç alan cihaz, internete ulaşmak için sağlayıcının getirdiği DSL(bakır hatlar) veya fiber hatlar yardımıyla bir haberleşme bağlantısına ihtiyaç duyar.Genellikle modemi içinde bulunan router cihazlar, basitliği ve kullanım kolaylığı açısından farklı bir işleme gerek duymazlar. Üzerlerinde bulunan ethernet portlarıyla da kablolu internet yayını yapabilir veya antenleri sayesinde kablosuz yayın yapabilir halde kullanıma hazır olurlar.Router ve performansları:Çoğu kişinin internet hızı ve gecikmeleri hakkında yaşadıkları sıkıntıların, kapsama alanı hakkındaki sorunlarının temelinde yatan sebeplerden biri de router kalitesidir. İçerisinde işlemci ve belleği bulunan cihaz, üzerinde çoklu sayıda bağlantı yapıldığında hepsini internete eriştirmekte yeterli olmayabiliyor. Bunu çok sayıda ve ağır programların açıldığı giriş seviyesindeki bir bilgisayarın kasmasına benzetebilirsiniz. Bu tarz problemler yaşamamak için daha kaliteli routerler tercih etmenizi öneririz.Detaylı bilgi için,CodernSoft sayfasına yönlenebilirsiniz.Written byFaruk AksungurBilgisayar Mühendisi https://www.codernsoft.comFollow10 10 10 WebWeb DevelopmentWeb DesignNetworkingNetworkMore from Faruk AksungurFollowBilgisayar Mühendisi https://www.codernsoft.comMore From MediumHow to Write Better React CodeCaelin SutchGokhan Ozgozen: Reading Other People’s Code Is a Great Way of Learning New ThingsMarina Vorontsova in codeburstwebG: Visualization of DOM TreeRevathi Suriyadeepan in Analytics VidhyaDouble equal comparison in JavascriptErdogan Oksuz in Trendyol TechWhy use git and Github?Emi Katsuta in Emi KatsutaWebSockets with Spring, part 1: HTTP and WebSocketAliaksandr Liakh5 Fun APIs for Your Next JavaScript ProjectsMehdi Aoussiad in JavaScript In Plain EnglishGetting your hooks into ReactChris BAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Frontend Mentor July 2020 review,https://medium.com/frontend-mentor/frontend-mentor-july-2020-review-71f9b49544a3?source=tag_archive---------19-----------------------,"Web Development,Coding,Learning To Code,Front End Development,Programming","Happy 1st of the month! I hope you had a great July. I’ve been head down working on getting our PRO subscription up and running, which I’m really excited to launch!I mentioned last month that I was hoping to launch by the end of July. Everything is pretty much ready to launch but I’ve taken on a full-time teaching contract for next week. Frontend Mentor is still a part-time project for me, so I need to earn money elsewhere to help pay the bills. Hopefully, the launch of subscriptions will allow me to move full-time on the site so that I can really start pushing the platform forward at a faster pace!So, because of the teaching contract, I’ve pushed back the launch to the week of the 10th. This means I’ll be able to give it my full attention when it does go live.I can now give you final details of what the features will be when subscriptions launch and also the pricing. So here it is!First, here is a breakdown of how the PRO features will work with monthly subscriptions vs yearly subscriptions:Monthly1 premium challenge download per month (these come with the Sketch design file included)2 Sketch design file downloads per monthPrivate solutionsUnlimited solution screenshotsYearlyUnlimited premium challenge downloads throughout the year (these come with the Sketch design file included)Unlimited Sketch design file downloads throughout the yearPrivate solutionsUnlimited solution screenshotsThese are just the first PRO features, I have much more planned to keep improving it. With the Sketch downloads, one of the most common questions I get asked is “can I still use them without having Sketch?“. The answer is yes! Sketch files are compatible with other design tools like Figma, Adobe XD, and Zeplin, which all have free tiers. So you’ll be able to use the design downloads even if you don’t have a Sketch license.Now, here’s what the pricing will look like!We’ll be launching with big discounts for the first 500 subscribers and they’ll be split into two tiers of 250:Super Early Bird (the first 250 subscribers): $7/month or $56/yearEarly Bird (the second 250 subscribers): $9/month or $72/yearOnce the first 500 people have signed up as PRO members, we’ll be moving the prices to $12/month or $96/year. So if you get one of the Super Early Bird spots you’ll be saving nearly 50% on the regular price!Once you join, you’ll also have that price for the lifetime of your subscription. So you won’t ever be subject to price increases when they happen in the future.I decided to go with a 33% discount on the yearly plan vs the monthly plan to help reduce the cost of it. Many companies go with 2 months free if you choose yearly but I want to offer 4 months free for any annual subscribers 🥳If anyone has any questions, please feel free to ask. I’m really excited to launch the subscriptions and I hope it’s the beginning of a new phase for Frontend Mentor. I hope you’re excited about it too!July was another strong month for new community members. We had 7,784 new members sign up to the platform and over 3,000 joining the Slack community. If you joined in July, welcome to the community! 🙂Now, here’s some more detail about what we’ve been up to and what we’ve got planned…Features & UpdatesThis past monthAs I mentioned above, basically all the work we’ve been doing on the platform has been focused on getting subscriptions ready. We’ve decided to go with Chargebee to handle the subscription management. From the research that we’ve done, they seem to be an amazing provider. Their API and documentation have been really enjoyable to work with so far, which is always a good sign! Through Chargebee we’ve integrated with Stripe and PayPal to process payments. So you’ll be able to choose to pay by card or through PayPal. As far as the functionality goes, there aren’t too many major changes with how the platform will operate. We just wanted to make sure that account management is made easy if you want to switch your plan from monthly to yearly (and vice versa), change your card details, or if you choose to cancel your plan. I always hate it when companies make you jump through hoops to cancel a subscription, so we’re making it a one-click process from your settings page. If you become a monthly subscriber you’ll start earning credits for the premium challenge and Sketch downloads. These will be renewed every month you’re subscribed and any unspent credits each month will build-up, so you don’t lose them. As I mentioned above, these initial PRO features are just our first step. We’ve got plans to build more PRO features into the platform to help you learn faster, and get an insight into how professional developers build websites.YouTube Live AMA — On July 1st I did a YouTube Live AMA session which will now be a monthly fixture. Due to my upcoming teaching gig, I’ll be delaying August’s Community Hangout session until the week of the 10th. This will actually work out well though as it will coincide with the launch of the PRO subscription. So you’ll be able to ask me any questions you’ve got about it then! In case you would like to see July’s Community Hangout, here’s the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcTDpZaBBxs.Small fixes — Although I don’t really talk about them, there are always small tweaks and bug fixes going on. If you ever notice an issue or have a feature request please don’t hesitate to message me and let me know. The easiest way is to do it through the chat widget on the site. It’s always so helpful when people report bugs and I can fix them on the spot! Once subscriptions launch we’ll actually be taking a bit of a step back and from new feature development for a little bit to focus on refining and improving what’s already on the platform. One example is improving the consistency with solution screenshots. You may have noticed some screenshots not looking quite right. One of the major issues is the vh unit distorting the screenshot. So we’ll be diving into that and trying to improve screenshots, among many other small fixes and improvements.This coming monthTeaching — For the first week of this month, I’ll be teaching for General Assembly here in London. It’s a full-time coding week for Digital Marketing apprentices and is always good fun to do. It does, however, mean I’ll only have 3 weeks of August to work on the platform!Launch subscriptions — In the second week of August, I’ll launch our PRO subscription. If you’re looking to join as a PRO member the best places to be notified so that you can jump on the early bird discounts will be the Slack community and the newsletter. If you’re not in either of those I’d recommend joining to be the first to know when they launch!Platform Improvements — As I mentioned above, for the last couple of weeks of August we’ll be focusing on making small improvements and refinements on the platform. It’s always good to have these periods where you take your foot off the gas and make the small changes that are needed instead of charging on with the next big feature.Mentor of the MonthMentor of the Month — Top 3Congrats to Ovidiu-Antonio for winning Mentor of the Month for July. Along with the Mentor of the Month 1st place badge, Ovidiu will receive a free premium challenge! 🥳Once subscriptions are live, the top place will win a month free for our PRO membership. I’m also going to be awarding the Mentor of the Year top place finisher a whole year’s subscription for free!Remember, you can earn points towards your Mentor Score by submitting solutions, having them liked/bookmarked, and also by having your comments on solutions upvoted.One of the quickest ways to build up your points is by helping others through providing feedback on solutions. Any upvotes on your comments add 15 points to your score. For a full breakdown of the point system go to your profile page and click the “i” icon by your Mentor Score.Thanks to everyone who has been helping other community members by giving feedback and support! 🙌Community sponsors for AugustFinally, I want to give a massive thank you to our community sponsors for August!Sizzy is an extremely useful browser designed specifically to improve a developer’s workflow when building websites. You can fire up multiple device emulators and run them all in sync while building out your web pages. Perfect for helping build fully responsive websites!Diversify Tech is an amazing resource for underrepresented people in tech. The site features job listings for anyone seeking new opportunities. The resource section is also full of useful links, so it’s well worth checking out.Dracula PRO is a beautiful dark theme to help keep you focused and productive while you code. The theme isn’t just for your editor either. You can also apply it to your most-used apps like your terminal and even Slack!I hope you have a brilliant month ahead. If you’ve got any feedback or suggestions, please do feel free to let me know. I’m always interested in hearing your thoughts.Until next month, happy coding! 🙂Frontend MentorImprove your front-end skills by building real projects.Follow5 Web DevelopmentCodingLearning To CodeFront End DevelopmentProgramming5 claps5 clapsWritten byMatt StuddertFollowFront-end/JavaScript developer who loves to build useful products.

React Bootstrap — Button Customizations,https://medium.com/front-end-weekly/react-bootstrap-button-customizations-3f56cc334cd2?source=tag_archive---------20-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Abigail Lynn on UnsplashReact Bootstrap is one version of Bootstrap made for React.It’s a set of React components that have Bootstrap styles.In this article, we’ll look at how to work with React Bootstrap buttons.Buttons BasicsReact Bootstrap provides us with multiple styles of buttons.We can change the style with the variant prop.For example, we can write:import React from ""react"";import Button from ""react-bootstrap/Button"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  return (    <>      <Button variant=""primary"">button</Button>{"" ""}      <Button variant=""link"">Link</Button>    </>  );}We have different varieties of buttons with different background colors.variant has the background color of the button.If the variant is link , then it’s displayed as a link.Button SizesWe can change the size with the size prop.For instance, we can write:import React from ""react"";import Button from ""react-bootstrap/Button"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  return (    <>      <div>        <Button variant=""primary"" size=""lg"">          Large        </Button>{"" ""}        <Button variant=""secondary"" size=""lg"">          Large        </Button>      </div>      <div>        <Button variant=""primary"" size=""sm"">          Small        </Button>{"" ""}        <Button variant=""secondary"" size=""sm"">          Small        </Button>      </div>    </>  );}We set the size to lg to create a large button.And we set the size to sm to create a small button.Also, we can add the block prop to make them display as a block-level element.For example, we can write:import React from ""react"";import Button from ""react-bootstrap/Button"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  return (    <>      <div>        <Button variant=""primary"" size=""lg"" block>          Large button        </Button>{"" ""}        <Button variant=""secondary"" size=""lg"" block>          Large button        </Button>      </div>      <div>        <Button variant=""primary"" size=""sm"" block>          Small button        </Button>{"" ""}        <Button variant=""secondary"" size=""sm"" block>          Small button        </Button>      </div>    </>  );}Then they all take up the whole row.Active StateWe can set the active to make them display in a different style to indicate that they’re active.For example, we can write:import React from ""react"";import Button from ""react-bootstrap/Button"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  return (    <>      <div>        <Button variant=""primary"" size=""lg"" active>          Large button        </Button>{"" ""}        <Button variant=""secondary"" size=""lg"" active>          Large button        </Button>      </div>      <div>        <Button variant=""primary"" size=""sm"" active>          Small button        </Button>{"" ""}        <Button variant=""secondary"" size=""sm"" active>          Small button        </Button>      </div>    </>  );}Disabled StateTo make the buttons disabled, we can add the disable prop to the Button .For example, we can write:import React from ""react"";import Button from ""react-bootstrap/Button"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  return (    <>      <div>        <Button variant=""primary"" size=""lg"" disabled>          Large button        </Button>{"" ""}        <Button variant=""secondary"" size=""lg"" disabled>          Large button        </Button>      </div>      <div>        <Button variant=""primary"" size=""sm"" disabled>          Small button        </Button>{"" ""}        <Button variant=""secondary"" size=""sm"" disabled>          Small button        </Button>      </div>    </>  );}Now they’re all disabled since we added the disabled prop.If the button is rendered as an a element, then pointer-events: none is used to disable the link.Button Loading StateWe can set the loading state of a button.To do that, we just set the props that we described above and the text content to indicate that it’s loading.For instance, we can write:import React from ""react"";import Button from ""react-bootstrap/Button"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  const [isLoading, setLoading] = React.useState(false);  React.useEffect(() => {    const timer = setTimeout(() => {      setLoading(false);    }, 6000);    return () => {      clearTimeout(timer);    };  }, [isLoading]);  return (    <Button      variant=""primary""      disabled={isLoading}      onClick={isLoading => setLoading(true)}    >      {isLoading ? ""Loading…"" : ""Click to load""}    </Button>  );}We have a button that sets the isLoading state to true when it’s clicked.This will also change the text to ‘Loading…’.We also have the useEffect callback to set the isLoading state to false after 6 seconds.The button is disabled with isLoading is true so that the user can’t click anything when the button is clicked.Photo by Ryan Stone on UnsplashConclusionWe can set the disabled , size , and variant props for the buttons.They let us change the disabled state, size and style respectively.Frontend WeeklyIt's really hard to keep up with all the front-end…Follow52 ProgrammingWeb DevelopmentTechnologySoftware DevelopmentJavaScript52 claps52 clapsWritten byJohn Au-YeungFollowWeb developer.

JavaScript Best Practices — Front End,https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/javascript-best-practices-front-end-e3c06a131afa?source=tag_archive---------21-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Johann Siemens on UnsplashLike any kind of apps, JavaScript apps also have to be written well.Otherwise, we run into all kinds of issues later on.In this article, we’ll look at some best practices we should follow when writing JavaScript code.Event DelegationWe can listen to the events from all the child elements with one event listener attached to the parent.For example, we can write:document.addEventListener('click', (event) => {  const {    currentTarget  } = event;  let {    target  } = event;  if (currentTarget && target) {    if (target.nodeName !== 'LI') {      while (currentTarget.contains(target)) {        target = target.parentNode;      }    }  }});We can check which element emitted the event in the event listener.All the data is in the event object.currentTarget has the element that now propagates the event.target has the original element that emits the event.Debounce, Throttle, and requestAnimationFrameDebouncing a function prevents it from being called again until a given amount of time has passed.We can do this easily with Lodash’s debounce method.Throttling only causes the function to be called a max number of times.Lodash also has a throttle method.requestAnimationFrame lets us throttle to 60fps when we run animation.Client-Side DataWe can get data on the client-side with the Fetch API.It’s a promise-based API that lets us make HTTP requests on client-side apps.If it’s not available, we can add a polyfill for it.When to Use a Client-side Data Request LibraryWe can use a client-side request library to make cancelable requests, add timeouts, or get request progress.They’re all made easier with 3rd party libraries like Axios.They also have transformers, interceptors, and XSRF protection that can be applied to all requests.We can also make helper functions that add error handling, cookie, CORS, etc.Concatenating RequestsGraphQL is an alternative way to make HTTP requests which don’t send JSON.Instead, it has its own query language to make requests via HTTP.It’s an alternative worth considering since it has type checks and lets us selectively get data by field.This means the calls ate more targeted and it’s more efficient.Unit and Integration TestingAutomated testing makes our lives easier.We can write unit tests to test some under the surface functionality.Integration tests test more functionality.However, visual checks still need to be done manually.LibrariesWe need to update our libraries often to keep them up to date.They often have security fixes and new features to make our lives easier.Also, utility libraries make our lives easier. They have many helper functions to help us.For instance, Lodash and Underscore have many things like clone , each , chunk and more.FrameworksFrameworks help us with developing faster.We can use popular ones like React and Vue which have lots of libraries that work with them to help build apps faster.CookiesWe can use local storage with a unique identifier in addition to cookies to make sure users that has the cookie is actually the user that should have it.Photo by Christina Branco on UnsplashConclusionThere’re many things we may have not considered.We can secure cookies with more tracking.Many libraries make our lives easier.JavaScript In Plain EnglishEnjoyed this article?

React Bootstrap — Carousels and Dropdowns,https://medium.com/dev-genius/react-bootstrap-carousels-and-dropdowns-a7930d62d8c6?source=tag_archive---------23-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Ricky Kharawala on UnsplashReact Bootstrap is one version of Bootstrap made for React.It’s a set of React components that have Bootstrap styles.In this article, we’ll look at how to customize React Bootstrap carousels and dropdowns.CarouselsCarousels are slideshow components that let us cycle through elements.The slides can have images or text.For example, we can use them by writing:import React from ""react"";import Card from ""react-bootstrap/Card"";import Carousel from ""react-bootstrap/Carousel"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  return (    <>      <Carousel>        <Carousel.Item>          <img            className=""d-block w-100""            src=""http://placekitten.com/500/500""            alt=""First slide""          />          <Carousel.Caption>            <h3>First slide</h3>            <p>              Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Praesent              ultrices ac dolor nec vestibulum.{"" ""}            </p>          </Carousel.Caption>        </Carousel.Item>        <Carousel.Item>          <img            className=""d-block w-100""            src=""http://placekitten.com/500/500""            alt=""Third slide""          />          <Carousel.Caption>            <h3>Second slide</h3>            <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</p>          </Carousel.Caption>        </Carousel.Item>        <Carousel.Item>          <img            className=""d-block w-100""            src=""http://placekitten.com/500/500""            alt=""Third slide""          />          <Carousel.Caption>            <h3>Third slide</h3>            <p>              Integer non ante ut arcu imperdiet maximus. Pellentesque id metus              porttitor,            </p>          </Carousel.Caption>        </Carousel.Item>      </Carousel>    </>  );}We imported the Carousel component, which has the Carousel.Item to display the item.Inside it, we can display an image.Also, we can add a caption for the image with the Carousel.Caption component.We can have anything inside the caption.Controlled SlidesWe can control the carousel state using th activeIndex and onSelect handler.For example, we can write:import React from ""react"";import Carousel from ""react-bootstrap/Carousel"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  const [index, setIndex] = React.useState(0);  const handleSelect = (selectedIndex, e) => {    setIndex(selectedIndex);  };return (    <>      <Carousel activeIndex={index} onSelect={handleSelect}>        <Carousel.Item>          <img            className=""d-block w-100""            src=""http://placekitten.com/500/500""            alt=""First slide""          />          <Carousel.Caption>            <h3>First slide</h3>            <p>              Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Pellentesque id metus              porttitor,            </p>          </Carousel.Caption>        </Carousel.Item>      </Carousel>      <p>{index}</p>    </>  );}We have the index state and the setIndex function to change it.Then we pass index as the value of the activeIndex prop to let us set the slide to go to.onSelect has the handleSelect function as the value to let us set the index when carousel navigation is done.We then display the index of the current slide below the carousel.DropdownsWe can add dropdowns to our React app with the Dropdown component.For instance, we can write:import React from ""react"";import Dropdown from ""react-bootstrap/Dropdown"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  return (    <>      <Dropdown>        <Dropdown.Toggle variant=""primary"">Dropdown Button</Dropdown.Toggle>        <Dropdown.Menu>          <Dropdown.Item href=""#/foo"">foo</Dropdown.Item>          <Dropdown.Item href=""#/bar"">bar</Dropdown.Item>          <Dropdown.Item href=""#/baz"">baz</Dropdown.Item>        </Dropdown.Menu>      </Dropdown>    </>  );}We have the Dropdown component that has the Dropdown.Toggle component to show the toggle.Dropdown.Menu shows the menu when the toggle is clicked.href can have any URL that we want to go to.variant is the styling variant.To make it shorter, we can use the DropdownButton component to combine the Dropdown and Dropdown.Toggle component into one.For example, we can write:import React from ""react"";import Dropdown from ""react-bootstrap/Dropdown"";import DropdownButton from ""react-bootstrap/DropdownButton"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  return (    <>      <DropdownButton title=""Dropdown button"">        <Dropdown.Item href=""#/foo"">foo</Dropdown.Item>        <Dropdown.Item href=""#/bar"">bar</Dropdown.Item>        <Dropdown.Item href=""#/baz"">baz</Dropdown.Item>      </DropdownButton>    </>  );}The title prop has the text content of the toggle.The Dropdown.Toggle and the Dropdown.Menu wrapper are eliminated because we have the Dropdown.button component.Styling VariantsWe can set the variant prop to change the styles of the dropdown.For instance, we can write:import React from ""react"";import Dropdown from ""react-bootstrap/Dropdown"";import DropdownButton from ""react-bootstrap/DropdownButton"";import ButtonGroup from ""react-bootstrap/ButtonGroup"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  return (    <>      {[""Primary"", ""Secondary"", ""Success"", ""Info"", ""Warning"", ""Danger""].map(        variant => (          <DropdownButton            as={ButtonGroup}            key={variant}            variant={variant.toLowerCase()}            title={variant}          >            <Dropdown.Item eventKey=""1"">foo</Dropdown.Item>            <Dropdown.Item eventKey=""2"">bar</Dropdown.Item>            <Dropdown.Item eventKey=""3"" active>              Active Item            </Dropdown.Item>            <Dropdown.Divider />            <Dropdown.Item eventKey=""4"">baz</Dropdown.Item>          </DropdownButton>        )      )}    </>  );}to display the dropdown with all the colors.Photo by Chelsey Faucher on UnsplashConclusionCarousels are slideshows with text and images in the slides.Dropdowns can have many varieties.Dev GeniusCoding, Tutorials, News, UX, UI and much more related to developmentFollow129 Sign up for Best StoriesBy Dev GeniusThe best stories sent monthly to your email. Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

GraphQL queries. From simple to more complex,https://medium.com/marcius-studio/graphql-queries-from-simple-to-more-complex-62274a026f98?source=tag_archive---------24-----------------------,"GraphQL,Web Development,Nodejs,JavaScript,Mongodb","Much has been said about the essence of GraphQL, but much less about the queries themselves. From simple to more complex, I’ll cover the topic.Статья на русском языке: https://habr.com/ru/post/332850/Hello World!In this post, we will cover queries that allowed you to understand how to work with GraphQL.Testing environmentsGraphiQL is a built-in server testing packageApollo Client Developer Tools — the same GraphiQL wrapped in Сhrom extensionAPI documentationAfter any changes on the server, documentation of requests will be updated. It will also automatically highlight errors.RequestsLet’s start with two simple types of queries, Queries (getting data) and Mutations (changing data).QueriesWith a simple query, you can turn to the user field and tell what values ​​the server should return: firstName and lastName.query myQuery{    user {       firstName       lastName   }}MutationsTo change data, need to set what exactly we want to replace and with what.mutation myMutation{  UserCreate(firstName: ""Jane"", lastName: ""Dohe"")}Queries are executed asynchronously, while Mutations are executed sequentially.SubsciptionsGraphQL has a third type — subscriptions. They are completely analogous to queries, and everything that applies to queries is suitable for subscriptions.subscriptions mySubscription{    user {       firstName       lastName   }}Subscriptions are needed to reactively update data on the client side when changes are made on the server.ArgumentsArguments allow you to do the obvious — substitute your values ​​and make a query. It does not matter at all whether it is query, mutation or subscription.First, we determine which arguments to use. Next, we apply them to the request field.query myQuery($id: '1'){    user (id:$id){       firstName       lastName   }}Such request will find a user with id = “1” and return fields firstName and lastName.VariablesIt is more interesting here, you can substitute your own values. In GraphiQL, you need to define a variable and designate its type, in full accordance with the documentation.query myQuery($id: ID){     user (id:$id){        firstName       secure {          public_key       }   }}Query variables block{   ""id"": ""595fdbe2cc86ed070ce1da52""}ID! — the exclamation mark at the end of the type tells GraphQL that this field is required.No need to worry about how to form a request on the client. For popular JS frameworks, everything is ready: vue-apollo, react-apollo, apollo-angular.Nested queriesThe above approaches are applicable when the required database field is at the first level (without nesting). An example of a MongoDB model:Without nested// MongoDB schemaconst schema = new mongoose.Schema({    firstName: {        type: String    },    lastName: {        type: String    },})export const USER_MODEL = mongoose.model('users', schema)// GraphQL typeconst user = {    firstName: {        type: GraphQLString    },    lastName: {        type: GraphQLString    },}export const USER = new GraphQLObjectType({    name: 'USER',    fields: user})With nested// MongoDB schemaconst schema = new mongoose.Schema({    firstName: {        type: String    },    lastName: {        type: String    },    secure: {        public_key: {            type: String        },        private_key: {            type: String        },    },}). . .const secure = new GraphQLObjectType({    name: ""public_key"",    fields: {        public_key: {            type: GraphQLString        }    }})export const USER = new GraphQLObjectType({    name: ""USER"",    fields: {        firstName: {            type: GraphQLID        },        secure: {            type: secure        }    }})Request for nested schemaquery myQuery($id: ID){     user (id:$id){        firstName       secure {          public_key       }   }}Combine Mutations with QueriesSometimes there is a task to combine Mutations and Queries. For example, when authentication.mutation auth($email: String!, $password: String!) {  auth(email: $email, password: $password) {    id    secure {      public_key    }  }}ConclusionWe examined the main requests that we may encounter during the development process.Thanks for your attention!Marcius Studio • hello@marcius.studio • Discord • TelegramIf the post was helpful, “hit” the “claps” button, and show how u like it. “Follow” @marcius-studio, we publish interesting and useful cases!Marcius StudioOnline studio specialised in full-stack web developmentFollow2 GraphQLWeb DevelopmentNodejsJavaScriptMongodb2 claps2 clapsWritten byNikita MarciusFollowCEO Marcius Capital, Founder Marcius Studio https://marcius.studioFollowMarcius StudioFollowOnline studio specialised in full-stack web developmentFollowWritten byNikita MarciusFollowCEO Marcius Capital, Founder Marcius Studio https://marcius.studioMarcius StudioFollowOnline studio specialised in full-stack web developmentMore From MediumThe 2021 Beginner’s Guide To AxiosBryan Dijkhuizen, BA. in JavaScript In Plain EnglishA Data Driven approach to forms with ReactRichard Všianský in JavaScript In Plain EnglishChat with WebSockets — Server and Client both in NodeJsPrimaBuilding HTML5 kiosk applications with Vue.js and ElectronAndreas SchallwigCreate Custom Links and Prevent Transitions With React RouterJohn Au-Yeung in Better ProgrammingAngular CLI: camelCase or kebab-caseTodd Palmer in Angular In DepthHow to use body-parser in Express to handle different POST requestsGohit VaranasiUsing Feature Flags in Next.jsDominik Ferber in Frontend DigestLearn more.Medium is an open platform where 170 million readers come to find insightful and dynamic thinking."
"React Tips — Value Changes, Server/Client-Side Rendering",https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/react-tips-value-changes-server-client-side-rendering-c26891be657e?source=tag_archive---------25-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by FLOUFFY on UnsplashReact is a popular library for creating web apps and mobile apps.In this article, we’ll look at some tips for writing better React apps.Why Can’t Input Value be Changed in ReactWe can’t change input value with React because we’ve to set the value prop of the input manually.For instance, we write:<input  className=""form-control""  type=""text""   value={this.state.name}  onChange={e => this.onChange(e.target.value)}/>Then in the onChange method, we can write:onChange(value){  this.setState({     name: value  });}We set the name state in the method.How to Render Text with a Single Quote with React JSXWe can render a string to render single quotes.For instance, we can write:return (   <div>     <p>{""I've eaten.""}</p>   </div> )We can also use the HTML entity version of the single quote.For instance, we can write:<Text>I&quot;ve eaten.</Text>Check if Variable is React Node or ArrayWe can use React.isValidElement to check if a variable is a node or an array.It takes a variable to check.And it returns true if it is and false otherwise.Detect if a Component is Rendering from the Client or the ServerWe can use lifecycle hooks to detect server-side rendering.If they run, then it’s rendered on the client-side.Therefore, we can create our own hook to do the check.We write:import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'function useIsClient () {  const [isClient, setIsClient] = useState(false)  useEffect(() => {    setIsClient(true)  }, [])  return setIsClient}to create the useIsClient hook.If the useEffect callback is run, then we know that it’s rendered on the client-side.Then we can check that it’s a client-side rendered app.Then we can use it by writing:”import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'function useIsClient () {  const [isClient, setIsClient] = useState(false)  useEffect(() => {    setIsClient(true)  }, [])  return setIsClient}function App() {  const isClient = useIsClient();  return isClient    ? 'client'    : 'serve'}We use the useIsClient hook to check for client-side rendering.Then we can render what we want according to that.Change Checkbox StateWe can change the checkbox state by passing in the checked prop to the checkbox.For instance, we can write:class CheckBox extends React.Component {  render() {    return (<input type=""checkbox"" checked={this.props.checked} />);  }}class App extends React.Component {  constructor(props) {    super(props);    this.state = { checked: true };  }  render() {    return (      <div>        <a href=""#"" onClick={ () => { this.setState({ checked: !this.state.checked }); }}>Toggle</a>        <hr />        <CheckBox checked={this.state.checked} />      </div>    );  }}We toggle the checkbox when we click on the link.Then we pass in the checked state to our CheckBox component, which has the checkbox.Then in the CheckBox component, we pass the checked prop to the checked value.Use Normal Anchor Links with React RouterThe React Router Hash Link package lets us create hash links easily in our React app if we use React Router.To install it, we run:yarn add react-router-hash-linkor:npm install --save react-router-hash-linkThen we can use it by writing:import { HashLink as Link } from 'react-router-hash-link';//...const App = () => {  //...  return <Link to=""/some/path#some-hash"">hash link</Link>}We can also add a nav link, which lets us set the active style.We can use that by writing:import { NavHashLink as NavLink } from 'react-router-hash-link';//...const App = () => {  //...  return <NavLink     to=""/some/path#some-hash""     activeClassName=""acrive""  >     hash nav link  </NavLink>}It takes an activeClassName prop to let us set the active class name when the link is active.Also, it supports changing the scroll behavior when we navigate to the element with the given ID.The link can also be customized.Photo by Charlie Green on UnsplashConclusionWe can use a package to create our hash links if our app uses the React Router.Input changes can be displayed if we set the value prop for text inputs.For checkbox inputs, we can pass in a value to the checked prop.We can render single quotes as an HTML entity or in a string.JavaScript In Plain EnglishEnjoyed this article?

Spreading Arrays with JavaScript,https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/spreading-arrays-with-javascript-6a2e987323?source=tag_archive---------26-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Amber Maxwell Boydell on UnsplashThe spread operator is one of the best recent JavaScript features.In this article, we’ll look at what we can do with the spread operator.Spread OperatorRhe spread syntax lets us expand iterable objects like arrays and strings in various situations.Merging ArraysWe can merge arrays with it.For example, we can write:const a = [1, 2, 3];const b = [4, 5, 6];const c = [...a, ...b[;We put all the items from a and b into a new array and assign it to c .So c is:[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]Clone ArrayAnother way we can use it is to shallow copy an array.For example, we can write:const arr = [1, 2, 3];const arrCopy = [...arr];We made a copy with the spread operator. It expands the arr entries into a new array.So arrCopy is also [1, 2, 3] .But they reference different objects in memory.Arguments to ArrayThe arguments object is an iterable object that has the arguments passed into a JavaScript function.It’s only available in a traditional function.For instance, we can write:function foo() {  const args = [...arguments];  console.log(args);}args is an array.So if we have:foo(1, 2, 3)Then args is [1, 2, 3] .A more modern alternative that works with all functions is the rest operator:const foo = (...args) => {  console.log(args);}Then if we call it the same way:foo(1, 2, 3)args would have the same value.String to ArrayWe can convert a string into an array of characters with the spread operator since string are iterable.For example, we can write:const string = 'hello world';const array = [...string];Then array is:[""h"", ""e"", ""l"", ""l"", ""o"", "" "", ""w"", ""o"", ""r"", ""l"", ""d""]Set to ArrayA set is an iterable object that can’t have duplicate entries.Since it’s iterable, we can use the spread operator with it.For example, we can write:const set = new Set([1, 2, 2, 3, 3]);const arr = [...set];Then arr is [1, 2, 3] since the duplicates are removed from the set.Map to ArrayMaps are key-value pairs that’s stored in an object.It’s also iterable so we can use the spread operator with it.For example, we can write:const map = new Map([  ['foo', 1],  ['bar', 2]]);const arr = [...map];We spread the map with the operator and arr would be:[  ['foo', 1],  ['bar', 2]]Node List to ArrayNode lists are a list of DOM nodes.It’s an iterable object but it’s not an array.To convert them to an array, we can write:const nodeList = document.querySelectorAll('div');const nodeArr = [...nodeList];We convert the node list returned from querySelectorAll to an array with the spread operator.Photo by Jessy Smith on UnsplashConclusionWe can use the spread operator to spread or copy arrays and convert iterable objects to arrays.JavaScript In Plain EnglishEnjoyed this article?

Intro to Web Bundling With Parcel.js,https://medium.com/swlh/intro-to-web-bundling-with-parcel-js-939bb2ebb7a1?source=tag_archive---------27-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,NPM,Website","Dominant JavaScript libraries like React.js make it seemingly easy to write front-end applications out-of-the-box. Have you ever wondered how React can transform your complex, multi-layered application into static HTML pages that can be accessed from any browser? Web bundlers play a vital role here. Let’s explore web bundlers together through a simple interactive example.What is Web Bundling?Web bundling is the process of fetching, resolving, packing, reducing a tree of dependencies into compressed static files that you may readily host on the web. The original pioneering package in web bundling is the famous Webpack. Webpack provides a sophisticated configuration interface to allow the developer to customize certain stages in the web bundling pipeline.For most mundane use cases, web bundling does not need explicit customization. This is where bundlers like Parcel.js come into the picture: Parcel.js allows you to bundle your web application with no configuration file. (note: Since Webpack 4, Webpack also offers basic web bundling with no configuration file.)Benefits of Web BundlingImmediate benefits that we can draw from using web bundlers are:Ability to scale without hurdles: Web bundlers can map out and bundle thousands and thousands of files that are linked with each other. You do not have to worry about adding complex build processes to accommodate the scale of your codebase.File compression: The web bundling process involves a compression stage, ultimately reducing the size of your website. This is great for your visitors (and your bandwidth meter).Safely use latest tech for the web: You can utilize packages from the NPM registry without worrying about how you can include hundreds of packages into the final build of your website.There are many more benefits, but these benefits are some of the highlights that you’ll immediately derive when you start using a web bundler. Now, let’s dive into using the Parcel.js web bundler with an interactive example of a website that computes the MD5 hash from a text field input.String to Hash: Simple example using Parcel.js bundler(Source code available at https://github.com/ahmedsakr/bundling-with-parcel)I built a quick one-page application to compute the MD5 hash output of some text. Here is the file structure of the project:The application required 3 separate files to bring it all together:Styling: I defined a style sheet style.css to provide some positioning and styling for the web page.Functionality: I defined the MD5 hash computing logic transform.js which makes use of the md5 NPM package.Web page markup: Finally, i brought together the whole application through the index.html markup.It looks simple, so why do you need a web bundler?The necessity for a web bundler here is due to using the md5 NPM module. Let’s take a look at transform.js:A core tenant of programming is to not re-invent the wheel. If i were to not use a web bundler, i would have to:Manually copy the MD5 implementation files into my project and then link them somehow; orImplement the MD5 hash algorithm myselfNeither of these options are satisfactory. Option 1 would unsubscribe me from any future updates to the MD5 package. Option 2 would require tremendous useless effort into something that has already been done.So, I chose to use the MD5 package on the NPM registry. However, web browsers do not recognize the ES6 import statementimport md5 from 'md5'Neither will they automatically look into node_modules for you. Web browsers want files to be explicitly and relatively specified.This is where web bundlers come to the rescue: web bundlers will automatically locate the appropriate implementation and bundle it into your application.How to use Parcel.jsWe now understand the necessity of web bundlers. Let’s dive into how to use Parcel.js for bundling our applications.Step 1: Install parcel from the NPM registryOnce you have your NPM project setup, you can install parcel with the following command:npm install --save-dev parcelStep 2: Add an NPM script for bundling your application with Parcel.jsI have already mentioned how simple Parcel.js is. All you have to do is provide Parcel.js with the entry file (your main HTML file) and it will discover all the other files automatically. Here is the NPM Script I have in this project:""bundle"": ""parcel build index.html --no-source-maps""This command will direct Parcel.js to bundle my application, outputting the final files into a dist folder. The --no-source-maps flag tells Parcel.js to not build map files for JS and CSS files (map files are development files to allow you to view the original code in the browser)When you run that script, Parcel.js will output the following:➜  bundling-with-parcel git:(master) ✗ npm run bundle                                                                                       > bundling-with-parcel@1.0.0 bundle /home/asakr/bundling-with-parcel> parcel build index.html --no-source-maps✨  Built in 1.26s.dist/transform.909609cc.js    6.81 KB     57msdist/index.html                 502 B      8msdist/style.2158241e.css         363 B    735msParcel.js scanned my index.html file, found that it provides references to style.css and transform.js , so it grabbed them and built them. When Parcel.js was building transform.js , it found that it makes use of an NPM module called md5 . It automatically pulled and bundled the relevant md5 implementation right into the final dist/transform.909609cc.js file that you see in the output above!Using a web bundler, my website is now only 3 files!! how amazing is that??Feel free to take a look at the repository (https://github.com/ahmedsakr/bundling-with-parcel) to see the entirety of the codebase. You can also clone the repository and try running Parcel.js yourself. I hope this tutorial provided a reference point for you regarding the importance of web bundlers.The StartupMedium's largest active publication, followed by +723K people.

A Simple URL Redirect To Your Root Domain,https://medium.com/dev-genius/a-simple-url-redirect-to-your-root-domain-883090c11caf?source=tag_archive---------28-----------------------,"DNS,Google Chrome,Web Development,Custom Domain,Namecheap","If you’re finding the above result when you try to access your website on Google Chrome, this article might hold your solution. First I’ll outline how I discovered my issue, and how I traced my steps to find the root source. Then I’ll explain the simple solution that will work for you if your issue stems from the same cause as mine.Works on One Browser but Not the OtherI recently finished retooling my website with a responsive design, so I pushed the changes to Heroku where my site’s deployed. When I visited the site on my iPhone’s Safari browser, it looked just like I expected. But I typed in the same URL in my iPhone’s Google Chrome browser and saw the error from above that says “This site can’t be reached…server IP address could not be found.” This lead to frantically checking my website on both browsers on all the devices in the apartment including my girlfriend’s iPhone. I type the same “choowatchin.com” into each address bar; sure enough Safari always found my site, and Google Chrome never found my site.I wasn’t sure why this happened. The only place I could pull up my website on Google Chrome was on my own MacBook Pro, which I used to build the site. Then I realized that Google Chrome autofilled my website as soon as I typed “choo”, so I deleted my history and tried it again. My suspicion was confirmed when Google Chrome no longer found my site after I deleted my browsing history. On a hunch, I tried typing “www.choowatchin.com” instead of leaving off the “www” like I had been. There it was! I tried it on all the other devices again, and they all worked.That in itself was a relief, but I still wanted to fix my site so it didn’t hide from Google Chrome when the user forgot the “www”. After scouring the Internet for solutions to this problem, I found that the simplest solution is to set up a URL Redirect.Setting Up the Redirect Through DNS SettingsHeroku hosts my website, and I go into detail about setting up custom domains for Heroku apps in a previous blog.Custom Domains for Heroku AppsPurchase a domain from a registrar and configure to route to a Heroku app.medium.comI bought my domain from Namecheap, so it is there I configure the DNS (Domain Name System) Settings to connect my domain to my app. Rereading my old blog post, I noticed something from the DNS Settings that I previously thought unnecessary. It was a URL Redirect Record created by default upon purchasing my domain. I had deleted it, and my app seemed to work fine so I forgot about it until now. Deleting that URL Redirect Record finally caught up with me when Google Chrome refused to recognize my URL without “www” prepended. So what was it I deleted?It was a URL Redirect Record with a Host of “@” and a Value of “http://www.choowatchin.com/”. The @ Host signifies the root domain, which is just my website URL without the “www” business at the start. The Value is just the full website domain.How To Redirect a URL - Website Redirect - NamecheapURL redirect (URL forwarding) allows you to forward your domain visitors to any URL of your choice (to a new domain or…www.namecheap.comOnce I added the URL Redirect Record back to the DNS settings in my Namecheap account, I could be my lazy self again, leaving off the “www” and making it to my website on Google Chrome all the same.React AppWeb site created using create-react-appwww.choowatchin.comDev GeniusCoding, Tutorials, News, UX, UI and much more related to developmentFollow25 Sign up for Best StoriesBy Dev GeniusThe best stories sent monthly to your email. Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

JavaScript Best Practices — Performance and Tests,https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/javascript-best-practices-performance-and-tests-1efe114c6ab7?source=tag_archive---------30-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Tiago Gerken on UnsplashLike any kind of apps, JavaScript apps also have to be written well.Otherwise, we run into all kinds of issues later on.In this article, we’ll look at some best practices we should follow when writing JavaScript code.The RAIL ModelThe RAIL model is created by Google to let us think about performance from the user’s perspective.RAIL stands for Response, Animation, Idle, and Load.Response is when the page first responds to user input.Animation is when the page moves.Idle is how long the page stays idle.Load is long the page takes to load.We should make our app respond to interaction as quickly as possible.Find Memory LeaksWe should check for memory leaks with various tools.One good tool is the Chrome dev tools, which has the Performance to show what’s using memory in our app.We can also check for memory usage of a tab with the Chrome Task Manager.Timeline recordings, visualize memory usage over time.Heap snapshots help us identify detached DOM trees.Allocation timeline recordings let us find out when a new memory is being allocated in our JS heap.We know that we have memory leaks if the memory usage increases over time until all available memory is used.Use Web Workers for Intensive TasksIf we have intensive tasks on our app, we can use web workers to run them in the background.It works by sending input to the worker and then when the worker is done, the results is sent back to the main app.They work on a different thread so they won’t hold up the main thread.Beware of Computational ComplexityWe should be aware of computational complexity of the algorithms we’re using.Things like nested loops and other slow code should be avoided.SimplifyIf we can write something in a simpler way, then we should do so.Avoid Recursive CallsIf there’s an iterative way to do something instead of recursion, then we should use iteration.It’s easier to read and the performance is good.RegexWe can use regex to search for patterns in strings.So we can use them to extract information.For instance,e we can write:str.replace(/\s+/g, '');to trim whitespace.We can also check email address format with:function validateEmail(email) {  const re = /\S+@\S+\.\S+/;  return re.test(email);}Use Search ArraysWe can search arrays with the find function.For example, we can write:let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];let found = array.find((element) => {  return element > 2;});to find elements in an array.We can also use this to avoid switch statements by checking for something in an array instead of using each array entry as a case .Use Google LighthouseLighthouse is a good tool for checking the performance of our browser app.It checks for performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO.Lighthouse runs in Chrome dev tools in the Lighthouse tabs and it’s also available as a Node package so we can run the checks automatically.Google PageSpeedGoogle PageSpeed lets us understand a website’s performance optimizations and find areas that we can improve on.It’s used to identify issues with compliance with Google’s web performance best practices.JavaScript Navigation Timing APIThe JavaScript navigation timing API lets us measure the performance of our website.We can use it by writing:const perfData = window.performance.timing; const pageLoadTime = perfData.loadEventEnd - perfData.navigationStart;We just subtract the loadEventEnd and navigationStarty timestamps to get the loading time.We can also calculate request response time with:const connectTime = perfData.responseEnd - perfData.requestStart;and page rendering time with:const renderTime = perfData.domComplete - perfData.domLoading;This describes the level 1 API, which is deprecated, but level 2 is coming.We can use this until level 2 is available.Test Our CodeWe should test our code with unit tests, integration tests, and user interface tests.Unit tests test small parts of the code like functions.Integration tests test bigger parts of the code like multiple functions or classes.UI tests test from the perspective of the user but in an automated fashion.Clicks and visual checks are done.Photo by Harley-Davidson on UnsplashConclusionWe should make sure the performance of our app is good.Also, we should test our code in various ways.JavaScript In Plain EnglishEnjoyed this article?

Bootstrap 5 — Customize Modals,https://medium.com/@hohanga/bootstrap-5-customize-modals-17a4c0c190a7?source=tag_archive---------31-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Louis Hansel @shotsoflouis on UnsplashBootstrap 5 is in alpha when this is written and it’s subject to change.Bootstrap is a popular UI library for any JavaScript apps.In this article, we’ll look at how to customize modals with JavaScript with Bootstrap 5.Change AnimationWe can change the animation with the $modal-fade-transform variable.We just set it to the value we want.To remove the animation, we remove the fade class from the modal markup:<button type=""button"" class=""btn btn-primary"" data-toggle=""modal"" data-target=""#modal"">  Launch modal</button><div class=""modal"" tabindex=""-1"" id='modal' data-backdrop=""static"">  <div class=""modal-dialog"">    <div class=""modal-content"">      <div class=""modal-header"">        <h5 class=""modal-title"">Modal title</h5>        <button type=""button"" class=""close"" data-dismiss=""modal"" aria-label=""Close"">          <span aria-hidden=""true"">&times;</span>        </button>      </div>      <div class=""modal-body"">        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit..</p>      </div>      <div class=""modal-footer"">        <button type=""button"" class=""btn btn-secondary"" data-dismiss=""modal"">Close</button>        <button type=""button"" class=""btn btn-primary"">Save changes</button>      </div>    </div>  </div></div>Dynamic HeightsWe can change the height dynamically with JavaScript by calling the myModal.handleUpdate() to change it.Optional SizesWe can change the size of the modal by applying a few classes..modal-sm makes it small..modal-lg makes it large..modal-xl makes it extra large.So we can write:<button type=""button"" class=""btn btn-primary"" data-toggle=""modal"" data-target=""#modal"">  Launch modal</button><div class=""modal modal-sm"" tabindex=""-1"" id='modal' data-backdrop=""static"">  <div class=""modal-dialog"">    <div class=""modal-content"">

aria-hidden=""true"">&times;</span>        </button>      </div>      <div class=""modal-body"">        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit..</p>      </div>      <div class=""modal-footer"">        <button type=""button"" class=""btn btn-secondary"" data-dismiss=""modal"">Close</button>        <button type=""button"" class=""btn btn-primary"">Save changes</button>      </div>    </div>  </div></div>to change the size of the modal by adding the modal-sm class in addition to the modal class.Fullscreen ModalWe can make the modal full screen with a few classes..modal-fullscreen makes it always fullscreen..modal-fullscreen-sm-down makes it full screen if the screen is below 576px wide.modal-fullscreen-md-down makes it full screen if the screen is below 768px wide..modal-fullscreem-lg-down makes it full screen if the screen is below 992px wide.And .modal-fullscreen-xl-down makes it full screen if the screen is below 1200px wide.We can make it always fullscreen by writing:<button type=""button"" class=""btn btn-primary"" data-toggle=""modal"" data-target=""#modal"">  Launch modal</button><div class=""modal modal-fullscreen"" tabindex=""-1"" id='modal' data-backdrop=""static"">  <div class=""modal-dialog"">    <div class=""modal-content"">      <div class=""modal-header"">        <h5 class=""modal-title"">Modal title</h5>        <button

data-dismiss=""modal"">Close</button>        <button type=""button"" class=""btn btn-primary"">Save changes</button>      </div>    </div>  </div></div>JavaScriptWe can manipulate modals with JavaScript.For instance, to show a modal with JavaScript, we can write:const myModal = new bootstrap.Modal(document.getElementById('modal'), {  backdrop: true})myModal.show();given that we have the following modal:<div class=""modal"" tabindex=""-1"" id='modal' data-backdrop=""static"">  <div class=""modal-dialog"">    <div class=""modal-content"">      <div class=""modal-header"">        <h5 class=""modal-title"">Modal title</h5>        <button type=""button"" class=""close"" data-dismiss=""modal"" aria-label=""Close"">          <span aria-hidden=""true"">&times;</span>        </button>      </div>      <div class=""modal-body"">        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit..</p>      </div>      <div class=""modal-footer"">        <button type=""button"" class=""btn btn-secondary"" data-dismiss=""modal"">Close</button>        <button type=""button"" class=""btn btn-primary"">Save changes</button>      </div>    </div>  </div></div>We create the modal object with the bootstrap.Modal constructor.Then we call the show method on the returned object to show the modal.There’s also the hide method to hide modals.handleUpdate readjusts the modal position automatically.dispose destroys the modal.getInstance gets the modal instance.Eventsshow.bs.modal is emitted when the modal is showing.shown.bs.modal is emitted when the modal is shown.hide.bs.modal is emitted when the modal is hiding.hidden.bs.modal is emitted when the modal is hidden.hidePrevented.bs.modal is emitted when the modal is shown, its backdrop is static and ca click outside the modal or with the escape key is performed or data-keyboard is set to false .Photo by Ola Mishchenko on UnsplashConclusionWe can use JavaScript to manipulate modals.JavaScript In Plain EnglishEnjoyed this

at how to work with React Bootstrap's grid system to create layouts.Grid SystemBootstrap’s grid system has a series of containers, rows, and columns to let us layout and align content.It’s built with flexbox and it’s responsive.ContainerWe can add a Container compoennt to contain our rows and columns.For example, we can write:import React from ""react"";import Container from ""react-bootstrap/Container"";import Row from ""react-bootstrap/Row"";import Col from ""react-bootstrap/Col"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  return (    <>      <Container>        <Row>          <Col>hello world</Col>        </Row>      </Container>    </>  );}to add our container, row, or column.Fluid ContainerWe can add the fluid prop to the Container to make the container 100% across all viewport and device sizes.For instance, we can write:import React from ""react"";import Container from ""react-bootstrap/Container"";import Row from ""react-bootstrap/Row"";import Col from ""react-bootstrap/Col"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  return (    <>      <Container fluid>        <Row>          <Col>hello world</Col>        </Row>      </Container>    </>  );}Ir also takes a value, we can write sm , md , lg , or xl .This will make the container fluid until the given breakpoint.For example, we can write:import React from ""react"";import Container from ""react-bootstrap/Container"";import Row from ""react-bootstrap/Row"";import Col from ""react-bootstrap/Col"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  return (    <>      <Container fluid=""md"">        <Row>          <Col>hello world</Col>        </Row>      </Container>    </>  );}Auto-Layout ColumnsWe can add multiple rows and columns and they’ll be automatically sized.Columns will be sized to equal widths.For example, we can write:import React from ""react"";import Container from ""react-bootstrap/Container"";import Row from ""react-bootstrap/Row"";import Col from ""react-bootstrap/Col"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  return (    <>      <Container>        <Row>          <Col>1 </Col>          <Col>2 </Col>        </Row>        <Row>          <Col>3</Col>          <Col>4</Col>          <Col>5</Col>        </Row>      </Container>    </>  );}And we’ll see the first row with 2 equal-sized columns and the 2nd with 3 equal-sized ones.We can also change the size of some columns.For instance, we can use the xs prop to change the size of a column if the screen is extra small.We can write:import React from ""react"";import Container from ""react-bootstrap/Container"";import Row from ""react-bootstrap/Row"";import Col from ""react-bootstrap/Col"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  return (    <>      <Container>        <Row>          <Col xs={6}>1 </Col>          <Col>2 </Col>        </Row>        <Row>          <Col>3</Col>          <Col>4</Col>          <Col xs={6}>5</Col>        </Row>      </Container>    </>  );}The other breakpoints can also be used as props for the same purpose.We can also auto-size some columns and specify the widths for others.For example, we can write:import React from ""react"";import Container from ""react-bootstrap/Container"";import Row from ""react-bootstrap/Row"";import Col from ""react-bootstrap/Col"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  return (    <>      <Container>        <Row>          <Col xs lg=""1"">            1          </Col>          <Col md=""auto"">Variable width</Col>          <Col xs lg=""3"">            2          </Col>        </Row>        <Row>          <Col>3</Col>          <Col md=""auto"">Variable width</Col>          <Col xs lg=""3"">            4          </Col>        </Row>      </Container>    </>  );}Then left and right columns are fixed sized.And the middle ones are automatically sized when the specified breakpoint in the prop names are hit.Responsive GridsWe can make the column responsive by setting the breakpoint props with which breakpoints to show.For instance sm={true} means the column will show if the sm breakpoint is hit.We can write:import React from ""react"";import Container from ""react-bootstrap/Container"";import Row from ""react-bootstrap/Row"";import Col from ""react-bootstrap/Col"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  return (    <>      <Container>        <Row>          <Col sm={5}>foo</Col>          <Col sm={7}>bar</Col>        </Row>        <Row>          <Col sm>foo</Col>          <Col sm>bar</Col>          <Col sm>baz</Col>        </Row>      </Container>    </>  );}And the columns will be resized if the sm breakpoint is hit.Photo by Denis Tuksar on UnsplashConclusionWith the React Bootstrap Container , Row , and Col components, we can make layouts easily.It’s responsive and automatically sized. This is made possible with flexbox.With these components, we can make any layout we like without much trouble.We can size columns according to various breakpoints we want to watch for.Written byJohn Au-YeungWeb developer.

Reactstrap — Buttons,https://medium.com/dev-genius/reactstrap-buttons-a178dd56fb72?source=tag_archive---------33-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Bonnie Kittle on UnsplashReactstrap is a version Bootstrap made for React.It’s a set of React components that have Boostrap styles.In this article, we’ll look at how to add buttons with Reactstrap.ButtonsReactstrap comes with its own button component.To add it, we use the Button component:import React from ""react"";import { Button } from ""reactstrap"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  return (    <>      <Button color=""primary"" className=""mr-2"">        primary      </Button>      <Button color=""secondary"" className=""mr-2"">        secondary      </Button>      <Button color=""success"" className=""mr-2"">        success      </Button>      <Button color=""info"" className=""mr-2"">        info      </Button>      <Button color=""warning"" className=""mr-2"">        warning      </Button>      <Button color=""danger"" className=""mr-2"">        danger      </Button>      <Button color=""link"" className=""mr-2"">        link      </Button>    </>  );}We add the Button component with the color prop to change the color of the button.The mr-2 class adds some right margins.Outline ButtonsButtons can also have outline styles.To add them, we add the outline prop:import React from ""react"";import { Button } from ""reactstrap"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  return (    <>      <Button outline color=""primary"" className=""mr-2"">        primary      </Button>      <Button outline color=""secondary"" className=""mr-2"">        secondary      </Button>      <Button outline color=""success"" className=""mr-2"">        success      </Button>      <Button outline color=""info"" className=""mr-2"">        info      </Button>      <Button outline color=""warning"" className=""mr-2"">        warning      </Button>      <Button outline color=""danger"" className=""mr-2"">        danger      </Button>      <Button outline color=""link"" className=""mr-2"">        link      </Button>    </>  );}SizesWe can add the size prop to change the size.lg makes it big and sm makes it small.We can add that by writing:import React from ""react"";import { Button } from ""reactstrap"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  return (    <>      <Button color=""primary"" size=""lg"">        Large Button      </Button>      <Button color=""primary"" size=""sm"">        Small Button      </Button>    </>  );}We added a large and small button with the size prop.To make the button a block element, we can use the block prop:import React from ""react"";import { Button } from ""reactstrap"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  return (    <>      <Button color=""primary"" size=""lg"" block>        Large Button      </Button>    </>  );}This will then span the whole row.Active StateTo make a button show the active state, we can add the active prop.For example, we can write:import React from ""react"";import { Button } from ""reactstrap"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  return (    <>      <Button color=""primary"" size=""lg"" active>        Large Button      </Button>    </>  );}The active state will be darker than the non-active state.Disabled StateWe can disable a button with the disabled prop.For example, we can write:import React from ""react"";import { Button } from ""reactstrap"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  return (    <>      <Button color=""primary"" size=""lg"" disabled>        Large Button      </Button>    </>  );}Checkbox and Radio ButtonsWe can make radio buttons out of Button components.To do that, we put them in a button group.For instance, we can write:import React from ""react"";import { Button, ButtonGroup } from ""reactstrap"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  const [rSelected, setRSelected] = React.useState(null);  return (    <>      <ButtonGroup>        <Button          color=""primary""          onClick={() => setRSelected(1)}          active={rSelected === 1}        >          apple        </Button>        <Button          color=""primary""          onClick={() => setRSelected(2)}          active={rSelected === 2}        >          orange        </Button>        <Button          color=""primary""          onClick={() => setRSelected(3)}          active={rSelected === 3}        >          grape        </Button>      </ButtonGroup>    </>  );}We have a ButtonGroup to group all the buttons together.Then we have the onClick prop for each button to set the rSelected state.The active prop let us set the condition for it to be active.We can also use buttons as checkbox buttons.For example, we can write:import React from ""react"";import { Button, ButtonGroup } from ""reactstrap"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  const [cSelected, setCSelected] = React.useState([]);  const onCheckboxBtnClick = selected => {    const index = cSelected.indexOf(selected);    if (index < 0) {      cSelected.push(selected);    } else {      cSelected.splice(index, 1);    }    setCSelected([...cSelected]);  };  return (    <>      <ButtonGroup>        <Button          color=""primary""          onClick={() => onCheckboxBtnClick(1)}          active={cSelected.includes(1)}        >          apple        </Button>        <Button          color=""primary""          onClick={() => onCheckboxBtnClick(2)}          active={cSelected.includes(2)}        >          orange        </Button>        <Button          color=""primary""          onClick={() => onCheckboxBtnClick(3)}          active={cSelected.includes(3)}        >          grape        </Button>      </ButtonGroup>    </>  );}We have the onCheckboxBtnClick function that runs to remove the selection if it already exists.Otherwise, it adds it to the cSelected array.The active prop’s condition now checks if the selection is in the cSelected array instead of checking for equality.This is because checkboxes can save multiple choices.Photo by Aswathy N on UnsplashConclusionButtons have many uses. They can be used individually or as checkboxes or radio buttons.Dev GeniusCoding, Tutorials, News, UX, UI and much more related to developmentFollow126 Sign up for Best StoriesBy Dev GeniusThe best stories sent monthly to your email. Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

How we organized an offline event in an online format due to COVID-19,https://medium.com/marcius-studio/how-we-organized-an-offline-event-in-an-online-format-due-to-covid-19-ba2de0845626?source=tag_archive---------34-----------------------,"Marketing,Nodejs,Web Development,Startup,Covid 19","I share my experience of holding an event in isolation. We got 1904 users and 163 leads in 24 hours. I attach the source code of app and full statistics with feedback.Статья на русском языке: https://habr.com/ru/post/513046/Hello World!We got interesting case. There were 2 weeks for preparation, 40 partners and 0 USD. Today I want to share my experience.marcius-studio/chatbot-online-gameReady-made online game with reward system. Functional: chatbot, admin, user profile, virtual money (points), list of…github.comIntroductionName of the event is “Night at the Technopark”. It usually organized offline from children’s technopark “Kvantorium «Friendship»”.Kvantorium - Russian federal project aimed at teaching children in technical areas, including IT.The main goal of event is to get acquainted with the areas of activity and the subsequent enrollment of children for learning.It was impossible organize offline event in the conditions of COVID-19. It was not right to refuse it, because leads for learning will be missed. The only option was the online format, there was an open question of how to do this.The final event took place in a game format. Users completed tasks and received points that could be spent on one of 1400 gifts.IdeaSince the event is started, we understood that will participate children, their parents and others. Many of these people don’t know about Kvantorium. We needed to acquaint them with the areas of activity, present it simply and clearly, motivate them to visit and consolidate result.The first thought was to developed a chat-bot and connect several traffic sources: WhatsApp, Telegram, Vkontakte (Russian social network). With ready-made solutions, it was possible to do this quickly, but this approach was very limited in functionality.We liked concept of a chat-bot, as it is an understandable solution, because we all use messengers. It was decided to keep chat-bot idea and add options. So idea of ​​developing own web application came up.The main part of web application should be in the form of messenger with buttons like Telegram and wrapped in game format. In the user profile, there is a link to register for learning and simple admin panel. Link became the starting point to add a reward system and attract partners.If we can add a link, why not add gifts from different organizations that will help them get customers and motivate our users?When the idea was formed, it remained to come up with a plot for the game. What’s a game without a storyline?PlotThe game is divided into 3 blocks. In each block, user answers the questions:Acquaintance with directions — user chooses one of 8 directions. In each direction there are 9 questions, 3 for each difficulty level: easy, medium and difficult.Acquaintance with completed projects — user selects the project(s) that were made in the Kvantorium. Points are awarded for correct answers. The trick is that each of the proposed projects is made in technopark.Reflection — we receive feedback from client from the proposed options or give opportunity to write it yourself.PointsFor the correct answer 10 points are awarded. So, in the first block can get 90 points, in the second 10. Reflection is included as a separate block solely to get feedback. If a user clicks on a button or writes a review, he gets 10 points. The maximum user can get 110 points per game.EmojiThis is an important part of development process. After application was ready, bot interface was perceived as “cold” and “impersonal”. To liven it up, we added emoji and drew an avatar.I have never used emoji in so many times. I read text, keep my emotions and added emoji. We saw the result of this approach in reflection, I will tell about it in the “analytics”.DevelopmentI see no reason to go deeper into development. Will describe the selected solutions for the client and server parts, as well as attach a link to Open Source.marcius-studio/chatbot-online-gameReady-made online game with reward system.

I believe that attraction and promotion is the second half of the volume of work.Event “Night in technopark” is an initiative of Kvantoirum and Ministry of Education and Youth Policy (next - ministry). Important stage before the launch is the presentation of project in the ministry and obtaining approval. The result of the presentation is positive emotions.PartnersThere were 40 partners and 1400 gifts in total, among them were edible and non-edible. Starting with a “basket of sweets” and a set of rolls, ending with a trip to dentist for 100 USD in different clinics. There were also certificates for various training sessions. At the same time, the partner company received leads, and we received advertising.The gifts were not endless and if the number dropped to 0, it was removed from the list of offers. This did not apply to certain certificates, which were unlimited.The main condition from partners was identification of their company, so after registration user was forced to open the list of partners. Also, the company’s logos were used in the list with gifts.PromotionBefore the start of the event, 3 groups were created to accumulate people: Telegram, WhatsApp, VKontakte. In groups, they posted posts about new partners, this helped to attract the majority of users.List of partnersAnalyticsAccountability was essential for partners and a common understanding of the picture. The easiest way was to export to Excel. We used the plugin “vue-json-excel”. The fields that were unloaded: name, email, region (yes/no), points, gift, company, direction of learning, feedback.GeographyGeography of the participants was different, gifts were available only to residents of Russian region. Checkbox was added during registration.Our region — 76.2%Russia — 23.8%Directions of learningMath — 25.6%Robo— 16.3%English — 14.7%IT — 11%Chemistry — 10.7%Industrial design — 9.3%Aero — 6.8%Chess — 5.5%FeedbacksThe reflection block offered ready-made answers, and the user could also write a review on his own.Friendly Bot — 35.7% (Emoji story)Tasks — 27%Interface — 9.8%Video greeting — 9.3%Other answers — 0.1%In “Other answers” there are answers that people wrote themselves. Almost all of them are positive, only 3 have a negative assessment of project.ConclusionI enjoyed working on the project.

"Customizing Django’s User Model- Login Via Email, Customizing User registration Functions.",https://medium.com/@sambyalsandeep31/customizing-djangos-user-model-login-via-email-customizing-user-registration-functions-5046fd0334c1?source=tag_archive---------37-----------------------,"Python,Django,Python Development,Custom User Model,Web Development","Hey Guys,Today I am going to talk about using the Custom User Model in Django. Django provides, a good enough ready to use User Authentication System. We can add users to the database and authenticate them in our application. But as we proceed many times, we come across situations like — We wish to log-in our users with their email, as by default Django uses Username to login and remembering username is quite hard. We may need to remove some fields and add our own custom field, etc.So the solution for all such issues is using a Custom User Model. Here, I will show you how to customize our default user model of Django. But before proceeding I would request you to kindly try this on a new project. Changing AUTH_USER_MODEL has a big effect on your database structure. It changes the tables that are available, and it will affect the construction of foreign keys and many-to-many relationships. If you intend to set AUTH_USER_MODEL, you should set it before creating any migrations or running manage.py migrate for the first time.Changing this setting after you have tables created is not supported by makemigrations and will result in you having to manually fix your schema, port your data from the old user table, and possibly manually reapply some migrations.So let’s go ahead and get some action started:This code is written in the following version:Python Version: Python 3.8.1 Django Version: 3.0.8Create an App: First, we need to create an Application where our custom user model will reside. Create a new project and a new app. Let’s name it as Home.Commands to Create Project and App:django-admin startproject myprojectdjango-admin startapp Home Once app is created, we need to register it to our INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py file of our project.INSTALLED_APPS = ['django.contrib.admin','django.contrib.auth','django.contrib.contenttypes','django.contrib.sessions','django.contrib.messages','django.contrib.staticfiles','Home',]2. Defining Model:As shown in the below code of models.py file: Account is the name of our model.AbstractUser and BaseUserManager class will be used to define our new models. Make sure create_user and create_superuser functions are defined in BaseUserManager.Code of Models.py File:from django.db import modelsfrom django.contrib.auth.models import (BaseUserManager, AbstractBaseUser)class AccountManager(BaseUserManager):    def create_user(self,email,password=None):        if not email:        raise ValueError(""User Must have an e mail address."")        user=self.model(        email=self.normalize_email(email),)        user.set_password(password)        user.is_active=False        user.save(using=self._db)        return user    def create_superuser(self,email,password):        user=self.create_user(email,password=password,)        user.is_admin=True        user.is_staff=True        user.is_superuser=True        user.save(using=self.db)        return userclass Account(AbstractBaseUser):        email=models.EmailField(max_length=50,unique=True)        id=models.AutoField(primary_key=True)        name=models.CharField(max_length=100)        date_joined=models.DateTimeField(verbose_name=""Date of       Joining"",auto_now_add=True)                  phone=models.CharField(max_length=25,default='',blank=True,null=True)        country=models.CharField(max_length=20,null=True,blank=True)                       last_login=models.DateTimeField(verbose_name=""Last             Login"",auto_now_add=True)        is_admin=models.BooleanField(default=False)        is_staff=models.BooleanField(default=False)        is_active=models.BooleanField(default=True)        is_superuser=models.BooleanField(default=False)        objects = AccountManager()        USERNAME_FIELD='email'    # This field will be the login field at login page.        REQUIRED_FIELDS=[]    def get_full_name(self):          # The user is identified by their email address        return self.email    def get_short_name(self):            # The user is identified by their email address        return self.email    def __str__(self):            # __unicode__ on Python 2        return self.email    def has_perm(self,perm,obj=None):        return True    def has_module_perms(self, app_label):        return True3. Update AUTH_USER_MODEL in Settings:AUTH_USER_MODEL=""Home.Account""   #(Name of App.Name of Model)4. Register your model in Admin.py File and Run migrations.Code of Admin.py File:from django.contrib import adminfrom .models import Account# Register your models here.admin.site.register(Account)***********************************************Run Migrations: python manage.py makemigrationspython manage.py migrate5. Navigate to 127.0.0.1/8000 and you will observe Username field is replaced by Email in our login page.Username replaced by Email.6. To create Users and superuser:For creating SuperUser: Run cmd for creating superuser. python manage.py createsuperuserC:\Users\Python\projects\Practise\Medium Blog 1\blog1>python manage.py createsuperuserEmail: s@saz.comPassword:Password (again):This password is too short. It must contain at least 8 characters.This password is too common.This password is entirely numeric.Bypass password validation and create user anyway? [y/N]: ySuperuser created successfully.For Creating Users: Now, we can simply use create_user function. Refer code below. You can create specific URLS for creating users.from Home.models import Accountfrom django.shortcuts import render,HttpResponsedef index(request):    user=Account.objects.create_user(""alb@alb.com"",""albas"",""12345"")    user.username=""alba""    user.save()    return HttpResponse(f""User created {user.username} -   {user.email}"")I think you will be clear now on how to create Custom User model. So in this post, we have covered how to create a Custom User model and logging with Email instead of Username and writing our own customized create_user and create_superuser functions.Written bySandeep Singh SambyalFollow2 2 2 PythonDjangoPython DevelopmentCustom User ModelWeb DevelopmentMore from Sandeep Singh SambyalFollowMore From MediumUnit Testing in Python — The BasicsMartin Thoma in The StartupWhat Is New in Python 3.9Afsalms in The StartupAkka Streams by example: processing filesMarc Rooding in wbaaShared Mutability in Rust (Part 1 of 3)Andrew Pritchard in The StartupHow To Create Meaningful Names In CodeDaan in Better ProgrammingCreate Your Own N-body Simulation (With Matlab)Philip Mocz in The StartupA Complete Guide to Basic Data Types in Python (with Examples)Sohaib Ahmad in Code PythonStep by Step: How to become MySQL replication functional without stopping master at Planeta HuertoAlberto Hita in planetahuertoAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Fullstack in 30days: An introduction to the web.,https://medium.com/@isaiahawotide/fullstack-in-30days-an-introduction-to-the-web-66e967dfc827?source=tag_archive---------38-----------------------,"Web,Web Development,JavaScript,100daysofcode,Fullstack Web Development","An OverviewThis article is one of many upcoming articles in the series I call ‘Fullstack in 30days’ where hopefully we will learn and remind ourselves about the basics of fullstack web development (i.e development of both the aspect of a web app a user directly interacts with and the one ‘they’ indirectly interact with). This series is my original interpretation and summary of the coursework offered by FullStackOpen an initiative of the University of Helsinki, Finland.But, before We jump right into the content, permit me to briefly explain the course outline, give a brief introduction to what we are going to discuss in this 30days journey, and offer some basic introduction into what is not discussed in the course. Technically, the course was designed for intermediate developers who have some knowledge of what technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are. Don’t be scared, I would provide a very basic introduction to those technologies before we delve into the original course content and the course itself includes some of the most used technologies(which includes Mongo Database, Express, Reactjs, Node, TypeScript, REST, and GRAPHQL architecture.)which we are going to delve into in upcoming articles in this series.DefinitionsEverything they say has a definition, and of course in the world of Tech, everything can be defined. In fact, we might have to think about concepts like:What is the web itself?What does it mean to develop for the web?Who is a web app developer?What are the benefits of knowing about how the web works?How can one develop a web app?What are the technologies involved in web development? etc.One could have more or fewer questions to ask depending on our level of curiosity about the web. We would provide some answers in this series of articles and maybe answer more in the comments section.What is the web?Well, according to webopedia,The Web, or World Wide Web (W3), is basically a system of Internet servers that support specially formatted documents. The documents are formatted in a markup language called HTML (HyperText Markup Language) that supports links to other documents, as well as graphics, audio, and video files.If you feel that is a lot to digest, you might want to imagine the web as a vast network of computers that allows for transfers of digital documents. If you don’t understand, worry not, it gets clearer as we go.What does it mean to develop for the web?Developing for the web is basically a fancy way of saying one is building contents that are publicly available on the web. i.e a way of saying one is building a website or a web app that can be accessed and used by users of the internet via their browser.Who is a web app developer?A web developer is a professional or anyone who builds a web app or a web site. A lot of people think web developers are nerdy witches and/or wizards who sit all day chanting incantations to summon the web spirits, lol! Nope, not really, web developers are just like anyone else but with special knowledge of how to build or develop for the web.What are the technologies involved in web development?This is one of the most interesting and of course the most controversial question on how to build for the web. However, since our focus, for now, is on the basics, we would conclude that HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the technologies involved in web development.Now that we have a basic understanding of what the web is and what it means to develop for the web. We would proceed in the next article in this series to discuss the various technologies involved in web development.Thanks for reading, and see you in the next article.Written byAwotide Isaiah (McZenith)I am a passionate financial technology prodigy with special interests in Software engineering, and a strong background in Economics, Finance and Econometrics.Follow57 57 57 WebWeb DevelopmentJavaScript100daysofcodeFullstack Web DevelopmentMore from Awotide Isaiah (McZenith)FollowI am a passionate financial technology prodigy with special interests in Software engineering, and a strong background in Economics, Finance and Econometrics.More From MediumRust & cross-platform mobile developmentIgor Steblii in The StartupHere Are 5 Thought-Provoking Apps to CodeIndrek Lasn in Better ProgrammingThe Dining Philosophers Problem Solution in CDigital Anna in The StartupMy favorite new features of Scala 2.13 standard libraryLinas Medžiūnas in Wix EngineeringDo You Use the Most Crucial Principle of Object-Oriented Design?Patrick Kalkman in Better ProgrammingImproving performance using distributed cache with CouchbaseSushmi Shrestha in Agoda Engineering & DesignRuby: Intro to Arrays Part 1Ines GuerreroHow to Solve First Missing PositiveIan Grubb in The StartupAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Deleting Database Entries From Firestore,https://medium.com/swlh/deleting-database-entries-from-firestore-bcdab8fc7287?source=tag_archive---------39-----------------------,"Vuejs,Database,Tutorial,Web Development","This is the final article from the short Vue and Firestore series. In this article, we will delete the entries from our Firestore database.IntroductionWe have created our app, created a database, configured that database to run in the app, sent our notes to the database, and also fetched notes from the database.We can create new notes which are stored in a database so we don’t lose our notes when we refresh the page. But we don’t have a way to delete any notes. Let’s make that happen.Adding a button to delete notesWe will add a button beside each note. Clicking that button will run a method that will remove the note from our notes array and will then delete that note from the database.We have to remove it from the notes array as well as the database since even though it's removed from the database, it will still show on our screen until we refresh the page. Only after we refresh the page, will the array be populated with the notes in the database and reflect our changes.So removing it from the array will make sure we see the changes immediately.Let’s add the button with the click listener before the title of the note:Delete notes methodWith the button added, all that’s left is the method. Removing the note from the array should be easy:Removing the note from the database takes a bit more code, but nothing too complex:Let’s go over this to understand it better.Deleting content from the databaseFirst, we have a string docToDeleteId. As the name of the variable suggests, it will hold the id of the document that will be removed from the database (all entries in the Firestore database are called documents). To delete a document or database entry, we will need its id.Now how will we get this id?We have the title of the note passed to the deleteNote method from the click listener. Using that, we fetch the specific note from the database:The first parameter in the db.collection().where() method is the title field in the document (remember each document or note in the database has 2 fields - title and content). The second parameter is self-explanatory - it means the first parameter should be equal to the third. The third parameter is our title argument.We got the note which has the same title as the note we want to delete. From this, we will get the id given to that note in the database:We store this id in the variable we created at the start.Now we delete this note from the database by specifying the id of the database entry we want to delete:That was a bit more complex than the code to simply add and fetch content to and from the database. But other than getting the id of the document entry, the rest was hopefully not that difficult to understand.Wrapping up the seriesThis wraps up the Vue Note Taker series here. We created a note-taking Vue app with simple features — it allows us to create notes, saves them to a database, and delete the notes.It doesn’t end here though. There are a lot of features that can be added to this app. For example — an edit feature to edit existing notes, making sure two notes do not have the same title to avoid deleting both notes when intending to delete only one of them, sharing your notes with others, etc.You can add these features and any others you can think of. Though the edit feature will take a bit of tinkering and diving into the docs. Or maybe, you can do things differently than I have and change the whole app. Have fun with it and try out new stuff.I hope you got to learn something new from this tutorial series.

Miner — Blog Framework based on Sapper/Svelte,https://medium.com/@bigilui/miner-blog-framework-based-on-sapper-svelte-6b2fbbe3b6f5?source=tag_archive---------40-----------------------,"Web Development,JavaScript,Svelte,Blogging","I open sourced the framework that powers my blog, and called it Miner!The README of the repo describes pretty well what it is and the story behind making it. It’s based on Sapper, the web app framework based on the Svelte UI framework.Sapper supports regular SPA mode (Single Page Application), as well as server-side-rendering options, or even all the way to static site generation. The static site generator mode is what I use out of it.Now, Sapper is a great web app framework, but it’s not specific for creating a blog. There are many basic features one would want for a blog, such as managing each post in Markdown files, defining meta-data for each post (e.g. as YAML Frontmatter), OpenGraph social tags for social network sharing optimizations, sharing icons, comments widget, and more.The Miner framework provides all of this out of the box. Quite literally, you can grab the repo, start writing Markdown files in the posts directory and you'll have a blog running.The NameI’m not great at naming and I thought for a while what to name it. I ended up with Miner — admittedly in this day and age, it’s going to make folks think of crypto miners.In reality, it’s an extension of the name Sapper. Miners are a specific type of sappers in war that attack forts. I thought it’s appropriate since Miner is a framework for building sites of a specific narrow category (a blog).Doing my part to push SvelteIf you’ve been reading my blog, you know I’m a fan of Svelte. As a modern frontend framework, I think it’s the one that makes the most sense among Angular, React, Vue, and now Svelte. Admittedly, out of these, I’ve only had extensive experience with React and Svelte; and only a cursory exploration with Angular and Vue in the past. From my experience though, a web app built on Svelte has the most concise code. Components have the cleanest code among different frameworks.Svelte is still relatively small, but if you look at the community, there’s already a lot of things built upon it. Case in point, searching on npm for a Svelte component for a specific thing usually yields some results. The other day, I was looking for a color picker and found one. If you’re looking for a calendar component, there’s one.If you’ve really been reading my blog, you probably also realize it’s not a secret that I dislike React. Right now, the tech industry as a whole basically develops frontend in React. I’d like to do my part to push for other frameworks to be viable, employable skillsets. Or, if you’d like to hear ir phrased more negatively, I’d like to do my part to dethrone React’s monopoly status as the frontend framework of choice in the tech industry/among startups. Getting just one more developer comfortable and in favor of Svelte is another step toward that goal.Other Svelte Blogging FrameworksBecause Sapper stops short of providing features of a blog, many people who’ve built a blog with Svelte wrote tutorials to build a blog with Svelte/Sapper, or in some cases even provided a sample repo, which is quite similar to Miner actually.However, I believe that a batteries-included framework can contribute a lot to adoption of a technology. Learning of any new tech takes ramp up time and effort. As individual elements, Svelte and Sapper may be easy to learn; and then once you’ve learned them, building basic features like those for a blog may be easy tasks; and finally wrapping your head around static site generation and a Netlify deploy may be simple once you’ve taken the time to read about it.But add all those together, now you’ve got a pretty high barrier of entry, if all you’re trying to do is to start a blog. You could start one on Wordpress, or another static site blog generator that’s more popular like Hugo (written in go) or Jekyll (written in ruby)… or you could take your time and learn all of above about Svelte, and then pick Sapper. I think most people would avoid this last route, given the options.However, what if you look at Jekyll’s “Get up and running in seconds.” tagline, see the 4 commands it takes to start a blog:gem install bundler jekylljekyll new my-awesome-sitecd my-awesome-sitebundle exec jekyll serveAnd compare it to Miner, which also involves just 4 commands to start:npx degit ""bigicoin/miner#master"" my-blogcd my-blognpm installnpm run devNow you start to have competition. Now you’re talking! That, at the end of the day, is what I’m trying to achieve.Originally published at https://bigi.dev.Written byBigi LuiLead Engineer @knockdotcom.

Tools Every Designer needs in 2020!,https://medium.com/@thedylanshort/tools-every-designer-needs-in-2020-5d4e00fec519?source=tag_archive---------41-----------------------,"Graphic Design,Design,Tools For Design,Business,Web Development","I know how many tools I use on a daily basis to get things done and simplify my workflow as a Graphic Designer. There are just some tools, tips, and tricks, that makes designing so much easier then people would think. Let’s go through the list that I have made. Check out the original Article Here!1. Adobe PhotoshopNow this is probably a given but I design in Photoshop, when I have to create a website, logo, brochure, advertisement, whatever it may be, it all starts in Photoshop. To me it is a very powerful tool if you know how to use it to its full potential, its something you never fully learn, there are so many tips and tricks that I still learn new things all the time. Because of its versatility, I can easily switch my products over to XD, InDesign, or Illustrator in just a couple of clicks.2. DaFont.comDafont.com is an amazing Font tool that I use all the time. It’s completely free and super easy to use. Sometimes the thousands of fonts you have and don’t use won’t work and you need another one for design. This website is an awesome tool for anybody really, not just designers.3. DropBoxThis is something that I use constantly and I mean constantly… I’m using it right now for uploading photos to this post. Dropbox is an online storage tool with many different features like signing documents, they even have a scanning tool for your phone to upload receipts and anything else really. It’s amazing and I’ve been using it for YEARS, I have thousands of files on it and you can access it from anywhere which is great.Free to use but I suggest upgrading, for me, I have 2 terabytes of storage which is awesome, you can install it to your computer and you basically have a second hard drive that you can access from anywhere. Today is the first time I’ve checked and I have only used 97 gigs.“If you do good work for good clients, it will lead to other good work for other good clients. If you do bad work for bad clients, it will lead to other bad work for other bad clients.” — Michael BierutClick to tweet: https://ctt.ac/eeJKC4. PureRefIt makes sense why you haven’t heard of this awesome software. It’s used as a reference program so instead of having a folder or 20 tabs open with photos and websites you like. PureRef lets you drag and drop photos and text straight into their software.It’s not free, you get it by making a donation so if you want to can get the program for $1. Its an awesome software and I recommend it to anyone that designs on a daily basis.5. Envato ElementsThere are tons of places to get stock images, brushes, videos, inspiration, and more but Envato Elements has this all in one place. It’s truly a massive library of designer needs and I use it all the time. Envato Elements cost about $16 per month. That’s the only downside, but it pays off in the long run.6. WeTransferYou have probably heard of this one but if not, you need to get on it. It is free to use and amazing. Sometimes designs and design packages can be really big files, and I hate sending things through google drive. WeTransfer is an awesome solution to this, you can send files up to 20-gigs+ with a paid version or up to 2-gigs with the free version, which is a hell of a lot better than googles 25-megabyte cap.7. UnsplashUnsplash is a great free stock photo website that I use often when Envato doesn’t have what I need. It has tons of images you can search and even references them for you so you don’t have to spend extra time. It’s great for making websites, wallpapers, and brochures, etc…8. BetterProposalsThis website is actually incredible, look professional with Better Proposals, you can design a proposal either from scratch or from 160 different templates and send it to your clients. It can track who opens them and do follow up emails, also you can sign your contracts from the first proposal. It’s incredible, and they look incredible! Let’s not forget your clients will love this as well.9. GoFullPageGoFullPage is a Chrome Extension and one I wish I would have discovered a long time ago and I’m actually using it for this post to get all the website photos. This extension takes full-page screenshots. Okay cool, why is that important, because it captures the entire page from top to bottom. One long image but you can also edit the image, crop the image, and way more. This is perfect for capturing websites you’ve designed or articles, etc…Below is a screen capture of the GoFullPage using their software:These are not obviously all the tools I use, I dabble in everything. I design in all types of software, I am certified in Adobe as well at AutoDesk programs. There are tons of tools I use constantly and some I use every once and awhile. I hope this list has helped you as I know these tools have helped me over the years!Written bydylan shortGraphic Designer and Business owner just trying to make everyone’s lives just a little bit easier! https://timemedia.net/blog/Follow8 2 8 8 2 Graphic DesignDesignTools For DesignBusinessWeb DevelopmentMore from dylan shortFollowGraphic Designer and Business owner just trying to make everyone’s lives just a little bit easier! https://timemedia.net/blog/More From MediumThe Intimate Relationship between Branding and UXMurillo Zerbinatto in The StartupHow Lifting 205 Kg Helps Me Become a Better DesignerNguyen Tran-Ngo in The StartupWhat the deep South taught me about the pitfalls and potential of designSue-Jean Sung in IDEO StoriesAll change is hard at first,"

"Variable declarations: var, let, const in JavaScript",https://medium.com/@anupamagadde/variable-declarations-var-let-const-in-javascript-3138add7168b?source=tag_archive---------43-----------------------,"JavaScript,Web Development,Variable Declaration,Var,Let","Variables are a way of storing a value for future use. There are 3 ways to declare a variable in JavaScript, namely, var, let and const. var, let and const are keywords in JavaScript. (Note: Variable names can start with any upper or lower case letter, an underscore(_), or dollar symbol ($). It can also contain numbers, but cannot start with them.)varVariables declared with “var” are scoped to the current execution context (Note: Scope is where a variable is visible and accessible), ie., a variable’s enclosing function or global scope (accessible everywhere in the program).When using “var” to declare a variable, initializing is optional.To assign a value to the variable, use the = operator:Can be reassigned at any point:Variables declared with “var” can be redeclared at any point. Duplicate variable declarations using var will not trigger an error, even in strict mode, and the variable will not lose its value, unless another assignment is performed.var declarations, regardless of where the actual declaration occurs, are processed before any code is executed. This is called hoisting. The declaration of the variable is hoisted to the top, and the initialization remains in the original spot.In the above code, dogBreed could be accessible outside of “if” block, as the variable dogBreed is scoped not just to the “if” block but, to the entire function. But when we try to access it outside the function, we get a reference error (ReferenceError: dogBreed is not defined).Now when we call the function again after changing the value of condition to “false”, we can see that dogBreed is “undefined” both from the else clause and outside of “if-else” block. This is because variables declared using “var” are hoisted to the top of the code, but not the value. Hence the variable declaration dogBreed is accessible inside of “else” clause and outside of “if-else” block. Since the value is not hoisted, the variable dogBreed would just have a value of “undefined”.Summary of “var”:· Scoped to the current execution· Initializing with a value is optional· Can be reassigned· Can be redeclared· Variable declarations with “var” are hoistedletThe “let” declaration syntax is the same as the syntax for “var”. Like “var”, initializing is optional.Assign a value using = operator:Can be reassigned:Cannot be redeclared (in the same scope):No error is thrown if the variable is declared with same name using “let” in its containing scope:Variables declared with “let” are not hoisted to the top of the code and are block scoped (ie., inside a function or inside a block — inside {} braces):In the above code, variable dogBreed is no longer accessible once the execution flows out of “if” block. This is because dogBreed was declared using “let” and so is not hoisted to the top of the code.If the condition evaluates to false, then the variable dogBreed is never declared or initialized:Summary of “let”:· Block scoped· Initializing with value is optional· Can be reassigned· Cannot be redeclared in the same scopeconst“const” stands for constant and is block scoped like “let”. Variables declared using “const” must be initialized upon declaration and cannot be reassigned or redeclared. Just like “let”, variables declared with “const” are not hoisted to the top.A “const” declaration prevents the modification of binding, not of the value. [According to MDN “The const declaration creates a read-only reference to a value. It does not mean the value it holds is immutable—just that the variable identifier cannot be reassigned”]. That means that “const” declarations for objects and arrays do not prevent modification of those objects and arrays.Constants can be declared with uppercase or lowercase, but a common convention is to use all-uppercase letters.Summary of const:· Block scoped· Must be initialized upon declaration· Cannot be reassigned· Cannot be redeclaredIt is better to use “const” by default and use “let” when you know a variable’s value needs to be changed.Thanks for reading.References:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let#:~:text=Description,function%20regardless%20of%20block%20scope.Written byAnupamaFollowJavaScriptWeb DevelopmentVariable DeclarationVarLetMore from AnupamaFollowMore From MediumHow to use React with the WordPress REST APIKatie Terrell Hanna in Pressing WordsHow to lock an angle when drawing on canvas in JavaScriptThang Minh Vu in freeCodeCamp.orgSetting up Webflow on Ruby on RailsKevin KimA White label solution using powerful features in Angular 7+Sunny Sun in JavaScript In Plain EnglishBuilding Pixel-Perfect Minesweeper in ReactLeyan LoHow to use the JavaScript console: going beyond console.log()Yash Agrawal in freeCodeCamp.orgHow To Prevent Native Race Conditions With React’s Context APINick Parsons in Better ProgrammingCreate an animated skeleton loader in React jsManish Mandal in How To ReactAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

(        <p>Drop the files here ...</p>      ) : (        <p>Drag 'n' drop some files here</p>      )}      <p>{selectedFile.name}</p>    </div>  );}We have the useDropzone hook with the onDrop state that comes from the React.useCallback hook.Once we selected a file, the callback in the useCallback hook will be called.We get the selected file from the acceptedFile parameter.Then we can display the name of the selected file with the selectedFile state.React ColorReact Color lets us add color pickers within a React app.To install it, we can run:npm i react-colorThen we can use it by writing:import React from ""react"";import { SketchPicker } from ""react-color"";export default function App() {  return (    <div>      <SketchPicker />    </div>  );}We added a color picker that looks like the color picker from Autodesk’s Sketch.To get the color, we can write:import React from ""react"";import { SketchPicker } from ""react-color"";export default function App() {  const [background, setBackground] = React.useState("""");  return (    <div>      <SketchPicker        color={background}        onChangeComplete={color => setBackground(color.hex)}      />      <p>{background}</p>    </div>  );}We get the hex value of the color with the color.hex property.Photo by Wesual Click on UnsplashConclusionThere’re packages to add color pickers, draggable elements, models and file pickers.DataSeriesImagine the future of dataFollow100 ProgrammingWeb DevelopmentTechnologySoftware DevelopmentJavaScript100 claps100 clapsWritten byJohn Au-YeungFollowWeb developer.

How To Write Clean CSS (SASS),https://medium.com/@seeocon/how-to-write-clean-css-sass-9ac3c8757ef4?source=tag_archive---------45-----------------------,"Sass,Web Development,CSS,Code,Programming","Photo by Med Badr Chemmaoui on UnsplashOh styling, probably a nightmare for most web developers. Sure we get things like SASS to clean things up and save the day for us — BUT it’s still not enough. I know over the years of my experience with web development, I have always dreaded writing stylesheets, simply because I would find myself overcomplicating and finding it hard to stay organized while working from the ground up with a new project.Why CSS Frameworks Are A NightmareI’m sure I’m not the only one who dislikes using CSS frameworks in my projects. I would like to say I am a purist, however I still use things like SASS to save me from the disorganization of vanilla CSS.Inline StylingInline styling is often very frowned upon, and not often used in modern practises. I believe that this is for two reasons:InternationalizationOrganizationInternationalization is a fairly large idea to wrap your head around; so I left the a link if you’d like to check it out.Organization is key in styling a web application. Using something like bootstrap may speed your initial development time, however since we are relying on a third party to maintain our structure this can cause technical debt down the road.When I say inline styling, I mostly mean using predefined classes in your markup — in large projects, managing this becomes a nightmare.!important (Writing Custom Styles)Have you ever working on a project with a CSS framework, and found yourself writing !important at the end of almost every line? Custom styles are a staple in most modern web applications. There are many design patterns we tend to follow when designing an application, which in that case — we can assume that using a CSS framework would speed things up — until, we want custom styling. Yes CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, which means that the workflow is similar to a water flow — we can simply just include our custom CSS after the CSS framework import, however even then we find ourselves writing verbose CSS, since we might even have to narrow down our CSS preciosity. More often than not, these CSS frameworks often use a lot of !important which completely bends the nature of CSS (cascading).But CSS is hardI’ve overheard so many conversations about how web developers, specifically that, front-end developers have no problem writing markup code, but when it comes to writing stylesheets they often find themselves at war with their styles.Often times, I believe a good front-end developer can write any styles for their stylesheet, a lot faster than relying on a large CSS framework, where more than half of what is written is not being used.This is a problem, CSS frameworks are used to unify designs; to keep things consistent, but are rather used to speed up development — which later on causes technical debt.Why is CSS hardI believe that most developers find writing stylesheets for their sites difficult because they:Start out organized, then end up getting lazy and start writing CSS all over the place.Start out disorganized, and continue with disorganization.I believe, that with the help of SASS, the cascading nature of CSS really starts to make sense, and I believe that it becomes a lot easier to write styles, however SASS on it’s own wont do much for you — you have to continue to stay organized after setting up.How To Use SASS To Write Organized StylesSo you’ve set up the wireframe in your markup. Assuming we have used some reset styling to reset the browsers default styling — we should have a blank page.<!-- other content --><main>  <h1>Apples</h1>  <p class=""some-sub-title"">The apple is the pomaceous fruit of the apple tree.</p>    <article>    <h2>Red Delicious</h2>    <p>These bright red apples are the most common found in many    supermarkets.</p>    <p>... </p>    <p>... </p>  </article><article>    <h2>Granny Smith</h2>    <p>These juicy, green apples make a great filling for    apple pies.</p>    <p>... </p>    <p>... </p>  </article></main><!-- other content -->Which should look something like:Output of the above markupWriting A Skeleton In SASSWe want to write a skeleton for the above markup, that way we can use it for all of our media queries.// oursass.scss/*main {   h1 {   }   p.some-sub-title {   }   article {      h2 {      }      p {      }   }}*/Now, anytime we would like to style the above for any device, we can simply just keep this comment at the bottom of our stylesheet — this way we can easily copy and paste it into a new media query.I will paste an example of a mobile first approach below:// Less than 600pxmain {   h1 {   }   p.some-sub-title {   }   article {      h2 {      }      p {      }    }}/* Larger than mobile (default point when grid becomes active) */ @media (min-width: 600px) {   main {      h1 {      }      p.some-sub-title {      }      article {         h2 {         }         p {         }       }   }}/* Larger than phablet */@media (min-width: 900px) {   main {      h1 {      }      p.some-sub-title {      }      article {         h2 {         }         p {         }       }   }}/* Larger than tablet */@media (min-width: 1200px) {   main {      h1 {      }      p.some-sub-title {      }      article {         h2 {         }         p {         }       }   }}// I will usually put my skeleton code here in a comment so I can always refer to an empty version of it in case I still somehow get confused about the structure of my styles.You may look at this, and say that you wont be using changing a certain style of a certain screen size — so then what is the point of this?Actually, Let’s Try Changing ~this~ Instead.We’ve all heard this one before. We take an input (designs possibly from a designer) output it by writing the markup / styling, and then we get feedback. Often times, once we see the web app in action — once we can interact with it, our opinion changes, and we often want to change positioning, subtract / add padding, change colours, hover effects, etc.Since the fact that writing a new component, or even a web app from scratch we go through many many revisions, we keep our skeletons around to minify the frustration we might have to face when trying to dig through our styles to see where to insert the desired new style. The reason why we include the skeleton in each breakpoint, is so that we don’t have to get confused about where the certain element we are trying to select is suppose to be, because in large applications, mapping where you should put a certain selector can be very frustrating.Yea, I guess that’s pretty organized, but what about performance?This is something I was very worried about when I first started writing my styles this way — however SASS automatically deletes empty selectors on compilation — in other words, we don’t have to worry about loading a bunch of empty selectors on production builds.Wrapping Things UpThis sure isn’t rocket science, and I think that there are developers that choose to write their styles this way. However, when working on a project with a team, I often find that most developers are still leaning towards using CSS frameworks, when really — writing your own clean, organized vanilla solution is more future-proof, as we do not rely on anyone but ourselves.Thanks for taking the time to read this article, I hope I opened up a new perspective for you on writing your styles.Ciao!Written byMichael O'ConnorReact lover, avid leaner. https://www.seeocon.co https://github.com/seeocon https://vsco.co/hzyFollowSassWeb DevelopmentCSSCodeProgrammingMore from Michael O'ConnorFollowReact lover, avid leaner. https://www.seeocon.co https://github.com/seeocon https://vsco.co/hzyMore From MediumCoding a REST API With PythonEric Chi in The StartupDeploy Spark on Kubernetes clusterManik Malhotra in Analytics VidhyaLaravel Firebase Authentication — Complete GuideGaonLabsImplement a WebSocket Using Flask and Socket-IO(Python)Narendra Harny in The StartupDeploy and Secure a React — Flask App With Docker and NginxAhmed Besbes in The Startup4 steps to learn programming faster and better (Quarantine Edition)Kaustubh Ghude in The StartupIntelliJ Keyboard Shortcuts to Swear ByJoshua Saunders in Better ProgrammingFlattening Nested Data (JSON/XML) Using Apache — SparkSai KrishnaAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Building Bridges between Design and Code — Practical Advice,https://medium.com/@sirtimbly/building-bridges-between-design-and-code-practical-advice-259eb72ac5b?source=tag_archive---------46-----------------------,"Web Development,UX Design,Product Design,Management And Leadership,Productivity","The problems with design-code hand-off are still manifold. I’ve been doing this for like 20 years and the process of turning visual direction into interactive applications is still fraught. Here are a few hints and principles to help you understand where this problem space has evolved lately.Use Figma, but it’s not magic. Figma is an excellent design tool that is more accessible to devs since it’s web-based and collaborative. Devs get better access to measurement tools, colors, and specific CSS values that can be forklifted into a component, but honestly that saves us 2–5 lines of code in the component implementation, so don’t get hung up on that.Don’t try to keep your static designs perfectly up to date with the work that makes it into production. Design tools are best used for creating a point-in-time snapshot. That snapshot will be attached to a story, ticket or issue in the project management tool, directing what developers should be creating. If the first implementation was sloppy and rushed because of deadlines, then put another story in the next sprint and keep circling in on that perfection until the product manager tells you to stop.Developers should not be allowed to push code to production without someone reviewing it for proper reuse of components and consistent usage of design token values instead of hard-coded colors, fonts and sizes.The designer needs to start with a systems and tokens mindset. They have to create reusable symbols that stick to a strict set of font styles, and colors. These values need to be synced with the code component theme values constantly. Also, the designer should have symbolic representations in their design tool that closely match up with the components that the developers have created.A documentation site or app for you system is nice, but quickly turns into so much useless static artifacts if it’s not tightly integrated with the code that runs in production. For this reason we use Docz to write markdown with lots of integrated live examples of everything the component API is capable of.Having a designer that knows how to write CSS and HTML is incredibly valuable. Working in the correct medium of the web is a turbo-booster in making that transition from idea to implementation.I still operate on both sides of this line, I produce designs for one team to implement in Figma, and have to answer their questions to give specific answers about all the details that a static image can’t cover. In my experience humility and agility are key in the design role.I also create React components based on the work of designers in another team and manage a dev team that produces components in a design system. We have to deal with all the technical aspects of packaging up a library of reusable widgets, and maintaining them. I believe Organization and communication skills are key in the engineering management role.See things like this published first on my website.Written byTim BendtSenior Software Engineer at Invisible Technologies, UX Design, Front-end developer, and world-travelling toddler-wrangler.FollowWeb DevelopmentUX DesignProduct DesignManagement And LeadershipProductivityMore from Tim BendtFollowSenior Software Engineer at Invisible Technologies, UX Design, Front-end developer, and world-travelling toddler-wrangler.More From MediumWhy Insights are a two-way streetHamed BahramiOnline Experiments 101: The BasicsAnton Martsen in Flo HealthDo the WireframesArtemis Ward in Artemis WardBrands Keep Apologizing for Racism.

Key To Stable Deployments In Angular,https://medium.com/dev-genius/key-to-stable-deployments-in-angular-fd63f30a76f8?source=tag_archive---------47-----------------------,"Web Development,JavaScript,Angular,Typescript,NPM","Let’s talk about a situation, you worked on a release for a month. You are using npm for managing your dependencies. After that you freeze the code for that release for getting deployed on production after 2 weeks. On the day of release, the deployment fails but it still works fine on your system. You are scratching your head and after lot of efforts and research you find out that a third party dependency you were using got an updated version which had a bug due to which your application is breaking.Find such types of issues is not only difficult but its frustrating as well. As in real world environment a delay in deployments due to such reasons might cost your company a lot.You might think of fixing the version of that library in package.json to the older version number without using any operator like ~,^ etc. That will work but in future you will stop receiving any updates of that third party library which might include patches, improvements and bug fixes.But wait, we just said it still works fine on your machine. How come even after reinstalling dependencies on your machine you didn’t get that error. Here comes the interesting part, which npm(version ≥ 5) provides us out of the box to make versions fixed once installed on our setup.If you look closely whenever you create a new project and run npm install on it. There is a file that gets generated i.e. package-lock.json. This file also gets updated whenever you add any dependency or you remove any dependency or update any dependency version manually.This file basically contains version number of dependencies that gets installed while running npm install. Which basically means that if this file is there in your project folder, next time you run npm install it will install exactly the same version which was installed earlier without considering any updated version.In the branch that is marked as stable for production release we should commit this file, so that it can become part of the tagged branch after release.So in future if any body wants to use and old tagged branch, he will get exactly the same version of dependencies which was mentioned in package-lock.json without having any impact of whatever operation you used with dependency version in package.json. Which means its not working on my machine issue will not occur due to any third party dependency.Same will apply to production release because that branch is now having a package-lock.json file it will only install required versions at which we checked our application to be stable. But, we should also considering removing this file once we want to have updated versions of all dependencies automatically in a branch where we have time for preparing a new release and testing it. And again Later, recommit newly generated package-lock.json when we have checked our new branch to be stable and good to go for production.Also, if you have this file in your tagged branches. All the tags you have are stable and good to run after installing dependency. Because they now know exactly for which version of dependencies they were stable. Because in a open source environment we know that even in minor releases sometimes the third party dependencies break existing code which was implemented on them.Although having a stable production release have many other factors like proper testing, less buggy code etc. But next time you have a deployment failure while deploying on production. Chances of having it due to a third party dependency are very less.If used responsibly(commit and remove again when needed), package-lock.json file is one more step towards having a stable release with no sudden surprises on the day of a production release.For knowing about package.json operators like ~ please refer here.Dev GeniusCoding, Tutorials, News, UX, UI and much more related to developmentFollow29 Sign up for Best StoriesBy Dev GeniusThe best stories sent monthly to your email. Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

Swagger for beginners,https://medium.com/the-innovation/swagger-for-beginners-a8c605a41fe5?source=tag_archive---------49-----------------------,"Software Development,Api Development,Web Development,Tech","Swagger is the most popular tool for Web developers to document REST APIs. If you have seen documents like below, most likely it is generated by using Swagger.Swagger UI ExampleThis article is not about how to design Web API. For that topic you could check on the following Medium article. I will introduce a simple version in next posts.REST: Good Practices for API DesignDesign Your REST API So That It Will Get Usedmedium.comThis article is about how to write Swagger to document your APIs. I start with Online Swagger Editor. It has example and preview, immediately. The example itself is a great way for us to quickly ramp-up on Swagger syntax.If you are worried about Online Editor may lose your changes, like I do, you could simply create an .yaml file on your local machine. Install the following 2 Visual Studio Code Extensions. You are ready to go.Visual Studio Code Extensions: OpenAPI (Swagger) Editor); Swagger Viewer;The OpenAPI (Swagger) Editor would do syntax highlight, error checking, auto-completion etc.Swagger Viewer provides Preview while you edit the yaml file.Notice: You don’t need to setup http-server to edit locally, nor run a docker. VS Code experience is so smooth and productive that I would highly recommend stay with this solution.VSCode Ready to Go with 2 extensionsFollow the example, could offer you quick ramp up. Still, the following points are good to know before hand. They should help you further speed up your progress.tags are the top tire API. All the other APIs are built to further enrich them, such as query pet by name, find pets with certain status. This is also aligned with API design principals.API should define it’s parameters. If you are asking, you need to know the question. Parameter is the clue to your question. It is required for your API.parameters could be in path or in query. In path parameters, are the ones embedded within the URL, such as /pet/{registrationId}; In query parameters, are the ones after the question mark, such as /pet/findByStatus?status=availabledefinitions section allow for reference. When we need to reuse certain format, such as json schema as return value, definitions comes handy for us to make references.schemas: http could be used for localhost testing. I use http://localhost:4000/pet/<registrationId> to manual test my server API. https would not work. But in production, https is highly recommended and even an industrial standard.Conclusion: By knowing above information, you could start to write your API document, share and discuss with your colleagues.

Is your Navbar a content-driven tool?,https://medium.com/@ricardowall13/is-your-navbar-a-content-driven-tool-f67617ac91b9?source=tag_archive---------50-----------------------,"Navbar,UX Research,Ux Strategy,Navigation Bar,Web Development","Your Navbar can be your best marketing-driven tool. Let me explain what I have been learning from hundreds of SaaS navbars.I will be centered in e-commerce and SaaS Navbars since are the most complex ones.A good Navbar is your first content driver tool.Today develop a good Navbar si crucial since SaaS companies have a lot of content doors like tutorials, community, dev resources, product portfolio, solutions, verticals, and industries.Devs, marketers, and designers are not focused on Navbars as other sections like Hero or pricing sections and this is a common mistake.When you are building a navigation bar is important to manage these 3 aspects for customer acquisition:**Don’t try to be so ‘creative’ with your Navbar because you can confuse your visitors.Reduce risk with A/B testing: Build small experiments changing the call to actions, routes, and naming. Small changes in data can ~2% gives you a good path to validate customer flow. If you have a landing page start your experiments here.Content Oriented (not navigation oriented): Put your best content inside your Navbar like sub-categories or as a “second” bar.Inform sales & marketing: When your content team or even your UX researcher works in the new experiments make sure you have your sales guy and marketer onboard.There is a lot of info about creating a smart internal link structure that not necessary is related to a content-driven approach but it’s SEO friendly.“If you have pages that you think are important on your site don’t bury them 15 links deep within your site and I’m not talking about directory length I’m talking about actual you have to click through 15 links to find that page if there’s a page that’s important or that has great profit margins or converts really — well — escalate that put a link to that page from your root page that’s the sort of thing where it can make a lot of sense.” Matt Cutts, Google 2011SaaS NavbarsHundreds of new companies are the focus now on the navigation menu and the taxonomy of their website since competence is harder than ever.A common mistake is to design a Navbar based on what we think the visitors need to see/read and not what the visitors want to accomplish.The main purpose of an awesome Navbar is to help your visitors to find and reach the content they are looking at enhancing user experience and indexation.VWO Navbar for resourcesThis means findability is the core job of any Navbar and one of the best ways that we have to build trusted findability is with content resources.Traditionally, one of the most important things you could do on a website to highlight your important content was to link to important pages often.It’s hard because you need to make sure your SaaS content is easily found by search engine crawlers but also to be with a nice user experience.Drift Resources sectionNowadays people looking for webinars, ebooks, developer resources or blog articles know that’s the first place to click on.Why this change? because visitors came from content-oriented networks like Linkedin, Twitter, Dev.to, Quora, Reddit, and StackOverflow so your content is the driver to your website then to your products.The same goes for products/products/features/platforms. This is where companies explain the product in detail and highlight the features.Evolution of content-driven NavbarHere is an example of an amazing content-driven Navbar evolution by Producthunt 2013 to 2020:Producthunt navbar in the last 7 yearsHere are a lot of A/B and UX. You can see how the search bar appears in all the navbars and how the team decided to put the call to action (one-line) inside the search bar, Discover your next favorite thing.From blog articles, radio, podcasting, events, jobs, deals, and new products ProductHunt evolve with many experiments.Now you can find a in their Navbar a bundle of services based on premium content like Deals, Jobs, and new ideas.This is possible for every SaaS business or community-oriented model. You can start building your company from your Navbar.Precisely and consistent content will drive customers to your services and products and the navbar, in this case, works great.There are great tools for A/B test your navigation menus like Hotjar, Crazzyegg, VMO, Optimizely, or even Webflow.Navigation to improve SalesGood navigation provides an improved user experience leading to more sales and revenue. Your website menu is a gateway to your portfolio.It seems that this amount of sections allows you to compartmentalize the most important zones of your website while also leaving room for other elements like buttons or phone numbers.Smart Search barIt helps to deep in our search, minimize the risk of misspellings and speeds up the entire search process leading to accurate results in lesser time.With this search bar section, your site will provide better conversion rates with your content, and also your visitors can find the exact product they need with minimal effort.Imagine a company like Oracle with hundreds of products and thousands of resources a good search bar is a must.New Oracle navigation barAt the end of 2019, Oracle changed their Navbar per complete focusing in resources, products, and support. With this new Navbar, Oracle gets a new content flow tone. Below you can see what happens when a visitor searches and find content related to Eloqua one of their marketing product.My suggestion here is to start promoting in your search bar to enable the forward-slash to see the full list of available content. It is a great new shortcut for your content like: /product/name or resource.Content DiscoveryGreat product discovery is related to content discovery is an essential key to conversion. Put content near to your products is a great way to provide valuable information about your product in an easy to see format which makes it easy for the visitors to browse.HashiCorp Content OrientedIt presents your catalog in the most relevant way. This way you can turn browsing into sales.HashiCorp is a good example of mixing the product portfolio with content discovery images. When visitors click your product you can put your best content near to the product description, this will increase your value proposition, try with your best webinar, blog post, or special content. The idea is not to break your product flow it is to boost the decision.Customer OrientedThe top-level navigation plays a decisive role in conversions. Use a Customer Stories in a creative way to attract visitors. Twillio knows a lot of this since his technology was kind of difficult to understand in a few years ago.Twilio Customer StoriesIn the Twillio Navbar, you can find customer stories about the most popular use-cases like On-demand Services and healthcare.It is common to use this approach when your services or technology it’s kind of new or complex. What a better way to talk about your product than your customer's voice?Subcategory DisplayRemember most of the top-level menu labels are simple and comprises of a single word. Can we have duplicate subcategories? Yes!Waterstones amazing subcategoriesFocus on subcategorization when you have very good content in those subcategories. Try a second menu, is ok! You can see this use in a lot of e-commerce websites, why not in SaaS?Remember that cookie retargeting helps to dynamically update the menu and present appropriate subcategories based on their earlier preferences.Rich Drop-DownA custom navigation menu containing images of information about the products or services will always contribute to better UX.In this way, you can follow the idea of many e-commerce websites like the Newbalance website.Newbalance Cookies with Rich MediaYou can display a full menu with your product names and also displays the content of your product like a piece of the webinar, a video, a quote from a client. This helps your visitors be more engaged with the productUse case-oriented contentThe Use case approach is great because you can build direct paths to the common use of a tool.For example Milanote a modern SaaS tool to organize content in visual boards. If this doesn’t sound familiar to you not worries just find your common use case and click it and then you will find the correct features for you.Milanote Use casesThe use case approach is great for complex, new UX, or new tech companies in the past we saw this in companies like Dropbox, Trello, Pinterest, and Airtable.Dev OrientedA lot of new SaaS companies are building button-up strategies and developers are their principal target.If you have an open-source, API, or good resources for developers or designers try to connect better in the Navbar. We have many examples here like Figma, Webflow, Giphy, and Segment.Segment Docs linkThis approach is great when you need to push a lot your products with developers, designers. A common mistake is to put the link in the footer. You need to give the real importance to one of your principal targets.You can find Getting started links, topics, and everything about the academy!This approach is similar for community-oriented companies like Rasa, Zapier, and Vercel. For example, Culture Amp boost their Community link in to the navbar because they need to increase their community strategy.An online community can easily integrate with the whole spectrum of organizational departments and processes that also allows you to build an acquisition channel powered by user-generated content and cultivate loyalty via stronger networks.Review the options above and consider which would be most helpful for your audience. Your website’s navigation bar is often the first touchpoint your visitors interact with to guide them to specific products or categories.Next?One of the biggest mistakes webmasters make is not implementing the features they already know can work wonders.You can have many navigation menus running at the same time because they help segment your audience based on their needs or preferences.If you don’t give them enough choices you risk not capturing their interest or having a bad retention rate.Go and experiment with content inside your Navbar!Written byRicardo MurilloQuestion Maker.

What is the difference between an expression and a statement in JavaScript?,https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/what-is-an-expression-and-what-is-a-statement-in-javascript-and-how-to-remember-it-4d6920ee7b08?source=tag_archive---------51-----------------------,"JavaScript,Programming,Coding,Web Development,Software Development","In JavaScript we have expression and statement. Even though I read the definition about it multiple times, after a while, I still forget which one is which. So, this post is a reminder for everyone like me who confuses these two, so you will never forget it but always keep in mind the difference between expression and statement.Photo by bruce mars on UnsplashA JS expression is any valid code that resolves into a value and can be written whenever you would expect a value. Usually expression are written in only one line. For example:42 // a number“Hello World” // a string42 + 1 // a calculationx = 42 + 1 // calculationmyVar // a variablemyFun() // a function that returns a value…But it’s more complicated than you think . There are different types of expressions:Arithmetic: Resolves to a number, e.g.4242 + 1etc.String: Resolves to a string, e.g.""Hello World""""123""etc.Logical: Resolves to true or false and often uses a logical operator, e.g.true1 === 0etc.Primary expressions: Basic keywords and general expressions, e.g.thisgrouping operator (...): (1 + 2) * 3etc.Left-hand-side-expressions: Left values are the destination of the assignment, e.g.var x = 42 + 1new operator: var myVar = new Object()super keyword to call the object’s parent: super.functionOnParentetc.A statement can span multiple lines in your code. In JS a statement is a little bit harder to describe that an expression, because a statement isn’t a keyword but rather a collection of keywords. A statement can be:control flow: a block of code, if … else, switch, try … catch, break, continue , throw , etc.functions and classes: function myFunction() { ... } , function* , async function , class , etc.iterations: while , do ... while , for , for ... of , etc.miscellaneous: debugger , import , export , with, etc.You can write an expression when a statement is expected. These kind of expression are called expression statements. But the opposite is not true, i.e. you can’t write a statement when an expression is expected. Here a few examples of an expression statement:ternary operator: ... ? ... : ...function calls: alert(""Hello World"")So expression, statement, and expression statement is connected in the following way:Now we know in detail what an expression and what a statement is, how do we remember it?Expression are short. Statements are long. I imagine expression to be like FedEx. Short, fast, easy to understand. While politicians make statements. They are long, can span multiple lines, and you often refactor statements than expressions.Do you have a better way how to remember expression and statement?

"React Tips — Pseudo-Elements, Conditional Display, and Constructor",https://medium.com/@hohanga/react-tips-pseudo-elements-conditional-display-and-constructor-487557f3e5b3?source=tag_archive---------52-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Diana Parkhouse on UnsplashReact is a popular library for creating web apps and mobile apps.In this article, we’ll look at some tips for writing better React apps.Conditionally Displaying Items in a React ComponentWe can conditionally display items in a React component in various ways.One way is to use a ternary expression.For instance, we can write:render() {  return (    this.props.showMe ? <button type=""submit"">show me</button> : null  );}The first item is shown if showMe is true and null is rendered otherwise.We can also use the && operator.For instance, we can write;{showMe && <button type=""submit"">show me</button>}Is showMe is true then the button is rendered since the expression will be evaluated.CSS Pseudo-elements in ReactWe can add prefixed styled by adding them as properties of the style object.For instance, we can write:render() {  return (    <div>      <span>Something</span>      <div style={{ WebkitFilter: 'blur(10px) saturate(2)' }} />      </div>  );},We have the WebkitFilter property which is equivalent to CSS’s -webkite-filter property.To make our lives raise,r we can use the style-it package to convert any CSS property to JavaScript style properties.To install it, we run:npm install style-it --saveThen we can use it by writing:import React from ""react"";import Style from ""style-it"";class Intro extends React.Component {  render() {    return Style.it(      `        .tooltip {          display:inline-block;

       }    `,      <div id=""tooltip"" />    );  }}We use the Style component with the CSS embedded in the string.Then anything that comes after the string will be styled with the given styles.Also, we can use the styled-components library to do the same thing.We can install it by running:npm i styled-componentsThen we can write:import React from 'react';import styled from 'styled-components';const Tooltip = styled.div`  .tooltip {    display:inline-block;    position:relative;    border-bottom:1px dotted #666;    text-align:left;  }  .tooltip .right {    min-width:200px;     top:50%;    left:100%;    margin-left:20px;    transform:translate(0, -50%);    padding:10px 20px;

   box-shadow:0 1px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.5);  }}`;const App = () => {  return (    <Tooltip>...</Tooltip>  )}We used the styled.div template tag, which is a function that takes CSS styles and returns a component with the styles.Then we can use them in our component as we did in App .Functions in Stateless ComponentsWe can call functions that are outside of the component within the component.For instance, we can write:const App = props => (  <Something onClick={props.update} />);We can get functions from props and call them.We can also have functions inside the component.For instance, we can write:const App  = props => {  const onClick = useCallback((a, b) => {    //...  }, [props.x]);  return (    <Something onClick={onClick} />  );}We use the useCallback gook to ensure that functions are only redefined when one of the dependencies in the array changes.Calling super() in a React Component ConstructorWe call super inside the constructor if we have to use this.props .For instance, we writ:class App extends React.component{  constructor(props){    super(props);    console.log(this.props);  }}So that we get access to this.props in our component’s code.Subclasses must call super before referencing this either simplicity or explicitly.Photo by Delphine SCHIEB on UnsplashConclusionWe can use libraries to incorporate pseudo-classes in our React component code.Also, we’ve to call super before using this in class components.Items can be conditionally displayed with boolean expressions.Written byJohn Au-YeungWeb developer.

N/A,https://medium.com/@devellostudio/welcome-to-devello-studio-online-development-environment-accompanying-you-from-coding-to-release-92d40eb332b?source=tag_archive---------53-----------------------,"Web Development,HTML,Github,Programming,JavaScript","Devello Studio, online development environment, accompanying you from coding to releaseAn overview of how Devello Studio editor looks likeDevello Studio, accessible via below address, is an online development environment empowering you to create, edit, import, export, debug, and release projects in your browser:https://devellostudio.com/It is first and foremost an IDE specifically designed for web development, supporting you in almost all aspects of the process, from coding to release, as demonstrated in following video:There are several methods available for creating a project. You can either start something from scratch and then create your own structure or import a project from anywhere on your local system (as a ZIP file) or even from over the web. For the time being, you can import projects from FTP servers or GitHub repositories. We’ll talk about the whole process with more details in another article in the near future.Different methods available for creating a project in Devello StudioCurrently two modes are supported for releasing your product, either via Github or FTP which are both explained in separate videos and we will cover them in later articles as well.We don’t support node technologies (yet), but otherwise you’ll find many topics covered you need when it comes to work with web based projects.You can create both public and private projects, and each project can contain unlimited number of files and folders according to your needs.This online development environment can be immediately used either by creating a project, opening a public project and extending it or forking it to keep the main version intact and having your own project. Although registering is not mandatory but you may take advantage of many extra features available for registered users such as being able to create private projects or the option to making your public projects read-only.You can make your own Devello Studio account or use your GitHub or Google accounts to login. Logging using GitHub account enables you to commit your projects to GitHub repositories or even sync your project with a repo, so you never miss anything.Public projects can be explored and viewed by all users via explore menu in the landing page.An interesting feature of Devello Studio is that you can practically keep on working exactly where you had left off your project last time, open files will be loaded as before and last file you were previously working on will be active again, and not only that, but also cursor position will be restored.Adding content to projects can be a real headache particularly when you have to deal with several items, but we allow you to add folder trees (folders containing files and other folders) using drag and drop, also you are able to compress your contents into a ZIP file and let it be uploaded and automatically extracted into your project.As you see in following image, several modes are available for viewing a file. If you just want to focus on coding, code view is perhaps best for you, as it provides you with a big code editor, otherwise you may switch to one of the split modes which show a preview of the code either horizontally or vertically.Files can be viewed in a variety of modes, according to your needsThere is another mode for just viewing the result (in this case no editor will be visible at all). Once project is opened, all files will be restored to their previous view modes.When it comes to presenting your work to others, Devello Studio has interesting offers in the form of embeddable versions. You can customize layout of the version your users will see the project by default, although they’ll be able to change it if allowed by you. In addition a project can have several embed versions, each with their own specific layout and design.We’re just in the beginning, and know that in order to be able to meet the overwhelming and ever increasing needs of developers, there’s still a long list of to-dos, and that’s what we’re working on. And last but not least, as a way to help you find out more about Devello Studio, we’ll occasionally post more articles on different topics, each of which focused on a certain feature. At the same time, you can watch our video tutorials here:https://devellostudio.com/videoStay in touch, and enjoy coding in the cloud with Devello Studio.Written byDevello StudioDevello Studio, online IDE for making web applications, supporting you from code to release.FollowWeb DevelopmentHTMLGithubProgrammingJavaScriptMore from Devello StudioFollowDevello Studio, online IDE for making web applications, supporting you from code to release.More From MediumWhy even bother with self-teaching?

HTML 5,https://medium.com/full-stack-web-development-course/html-5-c54412d1c380?source=tag_archive---------54-----------------------,"Web Development,Web Design,Website,Web,Website Design","Hypertext Markup LanguageHTML 5Note: This is a long article where I will explain every important element of html with some fun exercises as well, so please don’t read full article in one go. I have divided this article into different sections, so I will suggest to complete 1 or 2 sections at one time and then practicing it so you can be perfect. [sections ends with three black dots . . . ] Happy coding :)Hypertext Markup Language (aka HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. So, basically the content you see on any webpage is written in HTML.HTML 5 is currently the latest version which was released on 28 October, 2014 by World Wide Web Consortium.Content of HTMLTo know the basic elements of HTML lets visit www.example.com and right click on webpage, then click on ‘View page source’View page sourceAnother webpage will open with a lot code. This is the code that was required to build this webpage. This code contains basic codes from HTML and CSS. We will study CSS in next story.Source code of www.example.comHere you can see that the document starts with a tag <!doctype html> which tells the browser that the webpage is written in HTML. Then comes the <html> tag itself. Now every html content is written in between <html> tag.Between???… Yes! Look at the end of webpage, it has a closing HTML tag with a forward slash like this </html>. Most tags have opening and closing tags.After that just like a human body, HTML has also a head and a body. Next tag you see is <head>. It contains information like website title and much more.Then you can see <body> tag. It contains the main content you see on the website.After that comes <div> tag which is short for division. It used to divide the webpage into sections.Then comes <h1> tag. Here h stand for header. This tag contains the main heading of the website. Similarly <h2> tag contains second main heading of webpage.Then comes <p> tag and <a> tag. <p> tag used for writing paragraphs and <a> tag is used for including link in webpage as you can see on example.comNow open your IDE (I prefer using Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text). Click on File > New file > File > Save as > (Choose location) > webpage.html (You can name it whatever you want but the extension must be .html)Now write anything in this file and save it. File > SaveGo to the location where you saved that file, open it and you will the exact same thing written on a webpage.IDE on LHS & Webpage on RHSWatch full video in Hindi by CODINGVERSEMoving on to next section…Building Your First WebpageWe created a simple webpage where we wrote something [in my case “Hi, my name is Tarun :)]. Although we built a webpage but that wasn’t actually a webpage because it didn’t had a proper format.To build a webpage in HTML we use proper formatting:<!DOCTYPE html><html><head>    <title>My First Webpage</title></head><body>    <p>Hi, my name is Tarun :)</p></body></html>Here we inserted all basic elements of HTML which we have discussed before. Then we put “My First Webpage” between title tags and then finally the main content between p (short for paragraph) tags in body.We will discuss the proper formatting in details as we go further but for now this should work.Watch full video in Hindi by CODINGVERSEMoving on to next section…Header TagsWhatever we want to put in the heading of webpage, we put in the header tags. Now, header tags vary from <h1> to <h6> where <h1> tag being the biggest and main heading of the page and <h6> tag being smallest heading. After that if you try to add <h7> or higher tag, HTML will simply convert any content between these tags into default format. Try adding all six header tags in a webpage and see the difference for yourself:<!DOCTYPE html><html><head>    <title>Header Tag</title></head><body>    <h1>This is H1 tag.</h1>    <h2>This is H2 tag.</h2>    <h3>This is H3 tag.</h3>    <h4>This is H4 tag.</h4>    <h5>This is H5 tag.</h5>    <h6>This is H6 tag.</h6></body></html>HTML tags from H1 to H6In this picture you can see that from Heading 1 to Heading 6 everything is bold and gets smaller as the number increases but as it reaches to H7 tag, the content goes back to normal. We generally use headers till H4 and H1 tag is basically used to show the main heading of the webpage. H1 tag is used for SEO purpose so, must use an H1 tag on your webpage and choose it carefully.Watch full video in Hindi by CODINGVERSEMoving on to next section…Paragraph TagParagraph tags actually don’t actually style anything so you cannot see any difference with a <p> tag or without a <p> tag. See for yourself…Without <p> tagWith <p> tagAs you can see that there is no difference between these results. But what if you write a sentence on line 1 and then you want to write another sentence on line 2. This is where <p> tag comes in. It separates two paragraphs from each other.Use of <p> tagYou see that we have separated two paragraphs from each other using <p> tag. Here we have use dummy text to create paragraphs. You can find this on google or just type “Lorem” and hit enter to get a paragraph of dummy text.Next, if you want your text to just move to next line and not create a new paragraph then we can add <br> tag which is short for break. <br> tag is a self closing tag (i.e., it does not have any closing tag). Example:Use of <br> tagWatch full Video in Hindi by CODINGVERSEThat’s it for this section. Moving on to next section…Text FormattingText formatting in HTMLHTML provides us very basic styling of text. Here are some of them:BoldFirst way to do that is using <b></b> tag which is used for bold.<b> tag is fine to use but better (second way) way to make a text bold is by using <strong> tag which is same as <b> tag.<b>This is bold text.</b><strong>This is also bold text.</strong>Italic or TiltedTo make text italic use tag <i> or better way is by using <em> tag which is short for emphasis. Both gives us same results.<i>This is italic text.</i><em>This is also italic text.</em>UnderlinedWe use <u> tag for underlining text but better way to do this is by using <ins> tag short for inserted. Again same results.<u>This is underlined text.</u><ins>This is also underlined text.</ins>Superscript (Above the line)To make text superscript, we use <sup> tag.<sup>This is superscript text.</sup>Subscript (Below the line)To make text subscript, we use <sub> tag.<sub>This is subscript text.</sub>Deleted or CutWe use <del> tag to get deleted text. We also see <strike> tag in some websites.<del>This is some deleted text.</del><strike>This is also deleted text.</strike>Last, this is not text styling but we see in some websites a horizontal line which divides website into sections. To add such a line we use <hr> tag which is short for Horizontal Row.Text Formatting in HTMLYou can find more text formatting by just googling “Text formatting in html”.Watch full video in Hindi by CODINGVERSEThat’s it for now. Moving on to next section…ListWe can make two types of lists in HTML: Ordered lists & Unordered listsOrdered listsUse <ol> tag to create list and in the ordered list make <li> tags for list items. It creates a list with numbering.<ol>    <li>Some content</li>    <li>Some content</li>    <li>Some content</li></ol>2. Unordered listsUse <ul> tag to create list and in the unordered list make <li> tags for list items. It creates a list with bullet points instead of numbering.<ul>    <li>Some content</li>    <li>Some content</li>    <li>Some content</li></ul>If you want to start the list from a specific number you can add extra attribute to <ol> tag and define a number to start with.<ol start=”5""></ol>If you want to reverse the numbers in list just add attribute “reverse”<ol reverse></ol>You can make it a little bit interesting by formatting text of each list item differently (Use “type” attribute in <ul> or <ol> tag. Search on Google for more information).Watch full video in Hindi by CODINGVERSEMoving on to next section…ImagesWhat if we want to add images to our webpage?A great way to get free high quality images is to use unsplash.com, Download a pic from here and we will embed this pic into our webpage.Save it to the same folder where your html file is saved or it won’t load in webpage. (It’s important)To add an image we use <img> tag and this is a self closing tag. Add attribute <src> short for source which tells the browser where the image is. Text editor predicts the file name in same directory but if your’s doesn’t, don’t worry just write full name of file with extension (again important) and you will see the picture in webpage.<img src=""image.jpeg"">Now we can make some changes in picture by using some attributes like width & height defined by how many pixels<img src=""image.jpeg"" width=""100"" height=""100"">Also you can use “align” attribute to align the picture left or right. By default the images are aligned to left.<img src=""image.jpeg"" align=""right""><img> tag in HTMLNow we can embed the picture without downloading it.Google any picture, right click and select “copy image address”.Now we can paste this link in our <src> tag and that will load the picture from internet without downloading.<img src=""https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593642532454-e138e28a63f4?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=500&q=60"">This saves you from downloading the image and then putting it in webpage, but I would recommend to download and then embed it because if they change the address of image or block you from using it, then you will be in trouble. This is known as HOTLINKING when you link an image from someones website and use it in yours and they don’t generally like it. So, just DON’T DO IT!Watch full video in Hindi by CODINGVERSEMoving on to next section…HTML FormHTML forms are simple and are really powerful. Right now we are just going to make forms but it will not do anything.Start by using <form> tags and between them use basic element that is <input>, its a self closing tag. It creates just a box for input.<form>    Username: <input></form>We have several attributes for <input> tag. Have a look at “type” attribute:HTML form input typesRadio type is similar to checkbox but the difference is that you can select only one option from radio.Right now you can select multiple options in radio because these are not linked. To link them just give them all same name.<input type=""radio"" name=""xyz""><input type=""radio"" name=""xyz""><input type=""radio"" name=""xyz"">Next is adding drop-down menu. To add drop-down we use <select> tag inside the form element and <option> within <select> tag.<select>    <option>ABCDE</option>    <option>ABCDE</option>    <option>ABCDE</option></select>Last one is the submit button.<input type=""submit"">If you don’t want the submit button to actually show submit then use <value> tag.<input type=""submit"" value=""Click Here!"">If you want to guide the user to what they should fill in the that field, you can use <placeholder> attribute.<input type=""text"" placeholder=""Your Username"">We can use attribute “checked” in the checkbox tag to set that checked by default.<input type=""checkbox"" checked>And you can use “selected” attribute to the drop-down menu to set a default option.<select> <option>ABCDE</option> <option selected>ABCDE</option> <option>ABCDE</option></select>Watch full video in Hindi by CODINGVERSENow let’s have a look at “labels” attribute:Labels are used to make our site accessible to the blind people. So when they will be filling the form then screen reader software will look for the tag and it will help users. It also gives a nice caption to that element.Add <label> tags and then <input> tags between them<label>    Choose option:    <input type=""radio"" name=""xyz""></label>We use “for” attribute for connecting two elements:<label for=""username"">Username: </label><input id=""username"" type=""text"" placeholder=""Your Username"">It doesn’t not matter what name you give to the id as long as it’s not gibberish. It should be the same for “id” and “for” attributes so that both connect together.Watch full video in Hindi by CODINGVERSELast for the Form is validation. We can do simple form validations in HTML 5.To make a field required just add “required” attribute to the input.Username:<input type=”text” placeholder=”username” required>Next type of validation is email and password validation. We just need to change the type from “text” to “email” and “password”.Email:<input type=""email"" placeholder=""Your Email id"" required>Email:<input type=""password"" placeholder=""Your Password"" required>Let’s mix up everything and make a very basic Sign Up form:HTML FormWe will style it in the CSS as we go ahead.Watch full video in Hindi by CODINGVERSEMoving on to next section…TablesTables are great way to showcase table data in form of excel sheets. We add table by <table> tag. Then we add table row by <tr> tag and inside it we add table data by <td> tag<table>    <tr>        <td>XYZ</td>        <td>XYZ</td>        <td>XYZ</td>    </tr><table>It will fill just one table row. We can add another table row in similar way.<table>    <tr>        <td>XYZ</td>        <td>XYZ</td>        <td>XYZ</td>    </tr>    <tr>        <td>XYZ</td>        <td>XYZ</td>        <td>XYZ</td>    </tr>    <tr>        <td>XYZ</td>        <td>XYZ</td>        <td>XYZ</td>    </tr><table>Now we can add headings in table by using <th> tag and then we should separate table headings from body by <tbody> tag, short for table body.<table>    <tr>        <th>ABC</th>        <th>ABC</th>    </tr>    <tbody>        <tr>            <td>XYZ</td>            <td>XYZ</td>            <td>XYZ</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td>XYZ</td>            <td>XYZ</td>            <td>XYZ</td>        </tr>    </tbody></table>You can see a difference between table data and table heading. Table heading has actually bold styling by default in HTML.Try it out, make your own to-do list in HTML.Watch full video in Hindi by CODINGVERSELet’s move on to next section…LinksTo add a link to your webpage we use <a> tag which is short for anchor tag. Then we use “href” attribute that is short for hyperlink reference. Then put the text inside <a> tags to show on the webpage<a href=""http://www.google.com"">Go to Google</a>Not just text we can also use image as a link:<a href=""http://www.google.com""><img href=""abc.png""></a>You can link not just to other websites but also the webpages we created before in similar way:<a href=""helloworld.html"">Hello World!</a>Adding scroll to top feature:Add an “id” attribute to the component, we will use a lot of id in css and js.To select and id we use #<body>    <a id=”top” href=”http://www.google.com""><img href=”abc.png”>   </a>    <a href=”http://www.google.com""><img href=”abc.png”></a>    <a href=”http://www.google.com""><img href=”abc.png”></a>    <a href=”http://www.google.com""><img href=”abc.png”></a>    <a href=”http://www.google.com""><img href=”abc.png”></a>    <a href=”#top”>Back to top</a></body>Try assigning different ids to different elements and then make a link to jump there.Watch full video in Hindi by CODINGVERSEMoving on to next section…HTML EntitiesSuppose that you want to make a website where you show people how to code but if you write that code in the website it will just run the code instead of displaying it in the webpage. To get rid of this problem we use html entities or symbols.You don’t need to remember all these codes you just have to google it so type in “html entities” and go for first result. These entities start with “&” symbol and then its some numbers or letters, you can use any of them. Have a look:HTML Entities (Photo source w3schools.com)Try adding angle brackets using entities.You can use entities not to just show codes on webpage but also use other symbols too. (Like “Copyright” & “registered Trademark” or any currency symbol or stylish text)2nd website in google result shows all the other entities you need.HTML EntitiesThat’s it for now. We are almost to the end of HTML.Watch full video in Hindi by CODINGVERSEMoving on to next section…IframeThe main function of iframe is to display the content of other site in your site. You can’t use google in iframe because Google blocks it for some reason but you can try other website.I’ll try compressjpeg.com . This is great website to compress images online.Insert <iframe> tag and then add “src” attribute to insert a webpage.<iframe src=""https://compressjpeg.com""></iframe>A small window pops up but we can change it’s style and resize it using css.*Remember, not all sites approve you to embed iframe in your site.Now you are not going to use iframe to show some other site’s content in your webpage but it can be very helpful when you want to translate words on your site. For example, take data from other sites and show it on your site.Also we can use iframe to show youtube videos. To do that click on the share button of the video and click on embed.Embed option in HTMLYou can see that it’s an iframe code.From here you can select different options like when the video should start and do you want to show player controls or not and last to turn on or off the privacy mode.Embed code in YouTube VideoYou can see we have some attributes like “width” and “height” defined in pixels and also the frame border is 0 pixels. Try playing with these attributes and see the difference.Inserting YouTube video using IframeAnd this is the end of our HTML 5 section. Now I would advice you all to practice all of these HTML elements and then moving ahead to HTML Project. Or you can just start learning CSS 3.Watch full video in Hindi by CODINGVERSEWeb Development CourseLet’s get you started as a web developer and make pro in no time ;)FollowWeb DevelopmentWeb DesignWebsiteWebWebsite DesignWritten byTARUN KUMARFollowFollowWeb Development CourseFollowHi, I am Tarun and I will be explaining all the important elements of Web Development in this publication.

Understanding HTML: Semantic HTML and its significance.,https://medium.com/@jbassuquo4/understanding-html-semantic-html-and-its-significance-89c9517e3bcd?source=tag_archive---------55-----------------------,"HTML,Web Development,Semantic Html,Front End Development","Photo by Florian Olivo on UnsplashHTML represents Hypertext Markup Language, which is the standard markup language for all websites and web applications, in which almost every venture built for the web depends on. It speaks to the backbone and other auxiliary parts that give a website shape and backing. The structural components of HTML are tags, elements, attributes, and so on, just as some advanced components include <form>, <link>, and <img>.Tags and ElementsGenerally, HTML components comprise an opening or starting tag (<?>) and closing or ending tag (</?>). Opening tags are composed of left and right brackets while closing tags include a forward slash. Meanwhile, the term element alludes to the opening tag, closing tag, and any properties or contents contained in the middle of, while tags allude just to the opening and ending tags of an element.In HTML, self-closing tags are those tags that do not have a relating closing tag to match their opening tag, and a typical case of the self-opening tag is the <img>.Block and Inline ElementsOrganizing HTML components fall under one of two classifications in fact: block and inline. Block elements, for example, the <div>, start on a new line and take up the full width of the page. Other basic block elements include: <body>, <h1> through <h6>, <p>, <header> and <footer>. In any case, inline elements, such as the <span>, work inside the progression of the encompassing content, as opposed to starting their line. They additionally take up just the width of the content itself, as opposed to the whole width of the page. Other common inline elements include: <a>, <img>, <input>.Element AttributesAttributes depict the properties of and add significance to our HTML elements. Attributes are incorporated inside the opening tag of a given element with most characteristics composed as name-value sets like so, attribute=”value”. Moreover, there are many various traits we can apply, contingent upon the utilized element, and property we need. HTML consist of two primary qualities is ‘id’ and ‘class’, meant for referencing our future CSS styles and JavaScript functionality. We can apply the same class to different elements in our markup while using singular id attributes once inside an HTML archive.FormsEssentially, we send and receive client data on the web utilizing forms. In HTML, we utilize the <form> element to characterize a form, and our opening <form> tag incorporates these three attributes: action=”/thank-you”, method=”POST” and name=”contact-form”. We build HTML form fields by utilizing additional elements alongside certain attributes. Form elements, such as, <label> (describes our <input> tag) and <input> (characterizes fields where clients can enter various kinds of data to be submitted with the form) represents the actual fields a client will interact with when they enter their data in our form.LinksIn HTML, we make hyperlinks (composed with the <a> element) — or just, links (a common element of the World Wide Web) — utilizing the anchor element, which consists:1. Opening (<a>) and closing (</a>) tags,2. A required ‘href’ attribute that regularly accepts a URL as its value, and3. A discretionary yet regularly utilized target attribute to characterize where the link ought to open when clicked.Ordinarily, you will utilize target=”_blank” to open up a link in another browser tab. Once more, to allude to an external resource (generally a CSS stylesheet), the <link> elements are utilized. <link> elements will regularly be found in the <head> area of an HTML archive, which we will speak increasingly about later in this lesson.ImagesImages make up a key part of the web and come in an assortment of format types (jpg, png, gif, and svg). The <img> tag is how we insert pictures into HTML documents. The <img> element has two required attributes: src (gives the area of the image we need to reference), and alt (gives an elective content depiction of the referenced image for screen readers, search engines, and so on).ListsIn HTML, the <li> tag speaks to a list item. We use <li> tags to write out bulleted and numbered lists, and it is additionally usually used to create navigation items for a website and application. <li> components must be contained inside a parent element, which regularly will either be a <ul> (unordered list) or <ol> (ordered list) element. We wrap the parent <ul> or <ol> element with a navigation, or <nav> element when utilizing <li> elements as navigation things.HTML Document StructureThe structure of an HTML document to the functionality and extendibility of websites and web applications is crucial to its quality and life expectancy.<!DOCTYPE> Declaration and the <html> TagWe first need to include a doctype declaration, before we compose any HTML code in our document.<!DOCTYPE html>This declaration, composed as the principal line of code in any HTML document, guarantees that a browser follows important details.Next, we utilize the <html> tag to characterize the root element of our markup. Sometimes alluded to as the main root, the <html> element is a high-level element in our markup, which means every other element are relatives of the <html> element. As it were, the entirety of our HTML code will be composed within the <html> element.HeadThe primary element set inside our <html> element is the <head> element. This is the place we place the entirety of our document’s metadata — essentially, things that are read and interpreted by machines (programs, PCs, and so forth) rather than actual people. Accordingly, the code that we compose within the <head> element is not rendered in the browser window. A regular <head> rendered may include:1. <meta> tags that give organized metadata about the document. There is a wide range of <meta> tags to look over, for example, charset, viewport, and description can be used in your projects,2. A <title> tag, characterizing the title of the document,3. <link> tags, that connects external resources to the document (such as external CSS stylesheets, etc.), and4. <script> tags that reference or contain executable pieces of JavaScript code. You may likewise see <script> tags set not long before the ending </body> tag of a document.BodyNext is the <body> component. Any markup or content we need to show to end clients ought to be composed inside this element. Anything we compose inside the <body> element will be interpreted and rendered by the browser. A large portion of the tags and elements we have discovered so far ought to be put inside the <body> element. Our body segment starts with a <nav> component and two navigation items (as <li> elements) that incorporate anchor (<a>) tags linking to the About Me and Contact Me segments in the markup.Next we incorporate a <main> element with an id trait (id=”main-content”). This element shows browsers, screen readers, and other assistive technologies this is the place the essential content of the page is found. Within the <main> element we have two <section> element — one containing the About Me content (id=”about-me”), and the other containing a contact form (id=”contact-me”). We use elements like <main> and <section> to ration our content into thematically related groupings.Comments<!- — This is a comment in HTML. It will not be rendered in the browser, even if it is inside the <body> component → . Comments in our HTML code can help make our markup more clear (both for different developers and ourselves), or can be utilized to disable parts of our code from being rendered in the browser. Well-commented code is the sign of an organized and circumspect developer. The syntax for HTML comments begins with <! — and ends with →. Anything between those characters will NOT be rendered in the browser.Utilizing Semantic HTMLSemantic HTML or semantic markup is HTML that passes on significance to the page instead of just presentation. For instance, a <p> tag (is both semantic and presentational in light of the fact people know what paragraphs are, and browsers know how to display them) demonstrates that the encased content is a paragraph. Conversely, tags such as <b> and <i> are not semantic. They deﬁne just how the text should look (bold or italic), and does not acquaint any extra importance with the markup. Instances of semantic HTML tags include: Header tags <h1> through <h6>, <blockquote>, <code>, <em>, and so forth.By utilizing HTML tags that have meaning, you make pages that provide more detail than those that essentially encompasses everything with <div> tags. In the beginning phases of learning how to structure an HTML document, it is normal to wind up with what a few developers call “div soup.” Need a content area for your landing page? Envelop in a div! Building a sidebar? Div it up! Three segment design? Div, div, div! There is nothing practically amiss with composing HTML along these lines. Browsers, will at present, have the option to deliver your markup and show your content to clients. The essential issue with overwhelming utilization of <div> tags is that they need semantic importance. Composing semantic HTML gives your markup significance to internet browsers and screen readers, can help with SEO, makes it simpler to debug code, and that is only just the beginning.As indicated by the W3C:“The div element has no special meaning at all…Authors are strongly encouraged to view the div element as an element of last resort, for when no other element is suitable. Use of more appropriate elements instead of the div element leads to better accessibility for readers and easier maintainability for authors.”Alright, so what are these “progressively suitable components” that the W3C refers to? When HTML5 was discharged in 2014, it presented some new areas and gathering components that web engineers could use to improve the semantic importance of their markup.More semantic alternatives to the <div> tag include:The main <main> element,The aside <aside> element,The blockquote <blockquote> element,The nav <nav> element.Resources:1.

My Journey into Web development So far.,https://medium.com/@treasure.ihedigbo.g20/my-journey-so-far-as-a-tech-newbie-feb684981769?source=tag_archive---------57-----------------------,"Html5,Rad5academy,Rad5tech,Programming,Web Development","This is simply a story of what my baby steps in the tech world have been like.First off, being a growing girl who wasn’t sure of the exact things she wanted out of life, a few decisions were not so easy to make; the choice for a course to study was part of that, and knowing I had always abhorred computer science as a subject back in primary and secondary school, I never imagined a future that would have anything to do with tech, so I avoided taking up any tech-related course. It wasn’t until I was told and realised how important it is, that I decided to change my perspective view about tech, become more open to learning and discovering, and finally taking it up as my major course of study. And guess what.. I don’t regret it a bit.So, rewinding to some three years ago when I started off as a computer science student, things were cool but not as I really wanted. It dawned on me that most topics taught would be better understood if there was prior knowledge of it, so I was finding most lessons hard, uninteresting and I couldn’t wrap my head around most of them. This went on for a while until I decided to take up extra lessons during vacations, according to the advice of a senior colleague. That was my very first step in the right direction.As time passed I also learned about some other tips to help newbies and are necessary for improvement. As a result, I joined communities, started attending conferences, learned to grow my network, both online and on-site and kept taking online courses. I noticed how crucial it is to have a senior and experienced colleague by you as a beginner, they give the best pieces of advice, guidance and information.Fast forward to now, I can say my tech life has improved with regards to my coding skills in Web Development and networks. Consistency has played a vital role in that and though I’m not so experienced yet, I think it has been beautiful so far with the web development trainings at RAD5 Academy.Written byTreasure IhedigboFollow1 1 Html5Rad5academyRad5techProgrammingWeb DevelopmentMore from Treasure IhedigboFollowMore From MediumBuilding SpacesJenna Carando in Gusto DesignHow I Made It Into My Dream Company in 3 Years.Alise Otilia Ramírez (she/her) in The StartupHope for the Hopeless at Networking Events and PartiesLarry Cornett, Ph.D. in Invincible CareerQuitting a job after only one monthThom GalletWomen in STEM: The importance of diversity and inclusivityDigital Leaders in Digital LeadersFrom developer to team lead: re-engineering a mindsetFelipe CarvalhoGoing Crazy at Work?

Artisans et commerçants : 5 raisons d’avoir un site internet,https://medium.com/@yassine.krify/artisans-et-commer%C3%A7ants-5-raisons-davoir-un-site-internet-34ad17f2f8d7?source=tag_archive---------58-----------------------,"Web Development,SEO,Commerce,Web Design,Design","À l’heure de la digitalisation des entreprises, toutes les activités ont besoin d’un site internet. Même les commerces de proximité. Il ne faut pas croire qu’en tant que boulanger, coiffeur, menuisier, épicier ou encore maçon, avoir un site internet est inutile.Bien au contraire, comment espérez-vous avoir de nouveaux clients ? Désormais, les internautes n’hésitent plus une seule seconde à se servir de leur smartphone ou ordinateur pour trouver un service près de chez eux.Artisans et commerçants, pour vous convaincre de la nécessité d’avoir un site internet, Je viens de vous a sélectionné 5 raisons !Artisans et commerçants : 5 raisons d’avoir un site internetOptimiser le référencement localVous n’êtes sûrement par le seul artisan ou commerçant dans votre ville. Si vos concurrents ont tous un site internet, que va-t-il se passer lorsqu’un internaute va rechercher vos services près de chez lui ? Il va tomber sur les coordonnées des autres… Et une vente en moins pour vous !Avoir une vitrine numérique vous permet de vous positionner sur des requêtes locales, effectuées dans votre zone de chalandise. Vous augmentez ainsi vos chances de capter les internautes qui passent par un moteur de recherche (et non par les Pages Jaunes !).Se faire connaître des nouveaux habitantsEn tant qu’artisan ou commerçant, vous pensez que l’affichage dans certains points clés de la ville et le bouche-à-oreille sont suffisants ? Plus maintenant ! Évidemment, vous devez continuer à faire un travail de terrain, mais pensez aux nouvelles générations qui s’installent dans votre zone de chalandise. Elles ne connaissent encore pas le voisinage, ni forcément les « lieux de vie » où vous avez affiché votre pub.Si elles ont besoin d’un commerce de proximité ou d’un artisan pour effectuer des travaux, elles auront le réflexe Google ! Un site internet s’avère être un moyen efficace de capter ces nouveaux résidents et d’accroître votre portefeuille client.Agrandir sa zone de chalandisePourquoi rester dans une ronde de 5 kilomètres autour ? Peut-être que les quartiers au-delà de cette distance, ou les villages alentours si vous êtes à la campagne, regorgent d’habitants en quête de vos produits ou services. Ce n’est pas parce qu’il existe déjà un prestataire concurrent que vous ne pouvez pas vous y positionner.Ce commerçant ou artisan n’est pas parfait et il suscite peut-être l’insatisfaction d’une partie de sa clientèle. Avec un site internet, vous pouvez facilement cibler ces habitants pour élargir votre territoire de prospection et prendre quelques parts de marché supplémentaires.Garder un lien avec sa clientèleGarder un lien avec sa clientèlePour la pérennité de votre petite entreprise, il est essentiel de fidéliser votre clientèle. Un site internet vous offre la possibilité de conserver un lien avec elle. Comment ? Pour commencer, vous pouvez créer une newsletter et inciter vos clients à s’y inscrire. Vous pourrez leur envoyer régulièrement vos offres, leur octroyer des promotions et communiquer simplement sur votre actualité.Ajoutez aussi un blog pour qu’ils puissent suivre en temps réel votre activité, votre implication dans la ville et vos nouvelles réalisations.N’oubliez pas les réseaux sociaux, véritables vecteurs de fidélisation ! Avec eux, vous pouvez constamment dialoguer avec votre communauté, répondre à leurs questions et proposer un service après-vente complémentaire.Au final, le site internet vous permet de rester dans le sillage de vos clients.Pouvoir renseigner ses prospects et clients H24L’avantage du site internet ? Être disponible 24h sur 24 et 7 jours sur 7. Vos clients ou prospects ont perdu une information concernant votre entreprise (horaire d’ouverture, numéro de téléphone, adresse…) ? Un tour sur votre site leur permettra de la retrouver facilement.Ils se demandent si vous proposez une prestation spécifique ? Une visite sur votre site répondra à leurs interrogations. Le cas échéant, ils verront un bouton « contacter » qui les invitera à vous poser la question par email.Un site internet s’impose comme l’allié de votre service avant et après-vente. Il augmente la satisfaction de votre clientèle et aide à la conversion des prospects. À l’heure actuelle, il est impossible de négliger son importance.

Artisans et commerçants : l’importance de la vitesse de chargement votre site Internet,https://medium.com/@yassine.krify/artisans-et-commer%C3%A7ants-limportance-de-la-vitesse-de-chargement-votre-site-internet-f3cb23daf28b?source=tag_archive---------59-----------------------,"Web Development,Design,SEO,Web","La vitesse de votre site web doit être optimisée. C’est un point sur lequel vous ne pouvez pas transiger. Nous allons voir dans cet article :Pourquoi la vitesse de chargement d’un site web est importante ?Si vous lisez ces lignes, vous savez surement déjà qu’avoir une bonne vitesse de chargement est important. Mais pourquoi au juste ? Grosso modo, il y a 6 raisons principales.#1 C’est la première impression que se font vos visiteursLes « premières impressions » sont très importantes sur le web. Quand une personne atterrit sur un site web pour la première fois, il ne lui faut que quelques secondes pour se faire un premier avis sur celui-ci — et par extension sur votre activité en général. Dans l’esprit d’un visiteur, un site qui ne fait pas pro, qui ne fait pas très sérieux envoie un très mauvais signal sur le sérieux de votre activité.Or, la vitesse de chargement joue un rôle important dans la formation des premières impressions. Si vous voulez faire bonne impression mais que le nouveau visiteur doit attendre 5 secondes pour que la page se charge entièrement…vous êtes mal parti ! Inversement, si votre site web se charge quasiment instantanément, vous créez une excellente impression. C’est de la psychologie pure : on considère les sites qui se chargent rapidement comme plus fiables et plus professionnels que les autres. On associe naturellement la vitesse à l’efficacité et à la confiance. La lenteur de chargement, vous l’aurez compris, crée l’effet opposé. Et quand on créé une première impression mitigée voire négative, il est difficile de faire évoluer le jugement des visiteurs. Il existe des tas d’études qui démontrent l’importance de la vitesse de chargement d’un site web. Contentons-nous de mentionner une étude de KissMetrics, selon laquelle 79% des acheteurs en ligne affirment qu’ils ne retournent pas sur un site qui charge mal. Autrement dit, vous n’aurez pas de seconde chance ! Ne pas optimiser la vitesse de son site, c’est se priver bêtement d’une partie de sa clientèle cible.#2 Les internautes attendent des vitesses de chargement rapidesEn matière de vitesse de chargement, les attentes des internautes sont grandes, la barre est devenue très haute. A l’ère de la 4G et de la fibre, nous sommes de moins en moins tolérants et patients lorsqu’une page ne s’ouvre pas dans les 2 ou 3 secondes. Notre niveau d’exigence s’est accru avec le temps. Aujourd’hui, un site dont les pages se chargent en plus de 3 secondes est un site perçu comme lent. Et globalement, le seuil d’acceptabilité est encore plus bas sur mobile. Les mobinautes sont encore plus impitoyables.#3 L’expérience utilisateurNous avons beaucoup écrit sur l’expérience utilisateur ou UX. C’est une notion cardinale sur le web. L’expérience utilisateur c’est le sentiment général ou le jugement général que se font vos visiteurs vis-à-vis de votre site web suite à leurs interactions avec lui. Aujourd’hui, l’UX est un des plus puissants éléments de différenciation. Il y a beaucoup de facteurs qui contribuent à qualifier l’expérience utilisateur : la qualité du design de votre site, la fluidité de la navigation, la réassurance, la richesse de vos fiches produits si vous avez un site ecommerce, etc.Mais, plus généralement, votre expérience utilisateur est bonne si les visiteurs de votre site web trouvent facilement ce qu’ils recherchent…et s’ils le trouvent rapidement. Avoir une bonne vitesse de chargement est donc essentiel pour l’expérience utilisateur.#4 La lenteur d’un site fait perdre des conversionsD’après l’étude de KissMetrics mentionnée plus haut, 40% de vos visiteurs quitteront votre site web si vos pages mettent plus de 3 secondes à se charger. Imaginons que vous avez 100 000 visiteurs uniques par mois. Si votre site met 4 secondes à se charger, vous perdez d’un coup 40 000 clients potentiels ! Un site lent fait perdre des visiteurs, mais cela fait aussi et surtout perdre des clients potentiels…et donc du chiffre d’affaires. Ce n’est pas de la théorie. Amazon a calculé qu’une baisse de 1 seconde de la vitesse de chargement de sa plateforme entraînerait une perte de 1,6 milliard de dollars. Et Amazon est une entreprise connue, dont tout le monde connaît la proposition de valeur. Imaginez les effets que cela aurait pour VOTRE entreprise…#5 Les impacts de long-terme de la lenteur d’un site webNous venons de voir qu’avoir un site lent a un impact immédiat sur votre site internet : cela génère des perte de visiteurs. Vous perdez d’emblée près de la moitié de votre clientèle potentielle. Mais il y a aussi un effet de long-terme. Avoir un site lent freine progressivement votre croissance naturelle et réduit le bouche-à-oreille. Vos clients, à la longue, finiront par ne plus recommander votre site web à cause de l’expérience calamiteuse (ou, du moins, mauvaise) que propose votre site web. Les autres sites web finiront par ne plus vous recommander, par ne plus vous backlinker.. La lenteur de chargement décrédibilise un site web. A long-terme, cela peut avoir un impact considérable sur votre image de marque.#6 La vitesse de chargement a un réel impact SEOGoogle cherche sans cesse à améliorer l’expérience utilisateur des internautes qui utilisent son moteur de recherche. Il met régulièrement à jour ses algorithmes pour améliorer la pertinence des résultats proposés. La vitesse de chargement des sites est un critère pris en compte par Google dans sa manière de référencer les pages web. Les représentants de Google l’ont clairement indiqué, ce n’est pas une hypothèse. Evidemment, il ne s’agit que d’un critère parmi d’autres. Et surement pas le plus important. Une page très pertinente sur un sujet mais lente à charger sera toujours mieux référencée qu’une page plus rapide à charger mais avec un contenu indigent. Malgré tout, c’est un argument qui pèse quand on sait l’importance du SEO sur la visibilité d’un site web.Vous êtes convaincu de la nécessité d’un site internet ?

A little story on writing semantic HTML,https://medium.com/@chinonsoemmex/a-little-story-on-writing-semantic-html-867fbd9d6092?source=tag_archive---------62-----------------------,"Semanticweb,HTML,Web Development","Semantic HTML involves writing html in a way that makes it easy for search engines, screen readers and humans to understand. I will be explaining the little i’ve come to understand about writing for a semantic web.Photo by Ian Schneider on UnsplashI’ve come across websites that when i inspect their code with dev tools, i’m like 😕. The websites are fully made with <div>s and little use of semantic html tags. Semantic html involves using html tags that fully express their meanings and and not just for their presentations(example: using a button tag to wrap an a tag because you want the link to look like a button).Writing semantic html means putting structure and content first. CSS makes your content look beautiful not html. Html tags should not be used because of how they make content look, example: using a <blockquote> as it gives your content indentation(wrong!!! this can be achieved with margins in css). Write your html so that your content has meaning, use <p> not divs when you want paragraphs, don’t use the heading tags(h1-h6) because you want big dark text(this can be achieved with css), before using a html always ask yourself(does this tag really explain what i’m trying to pass across in my content). The heading tags before the introduction of <article > and <section> tags where mainly used for introducing new sections in content, an example below..<h1>Main heading for the web page</h1><h2>sub heading</h2> // new sectionevery content under h2 is regarded as part of this new section<p>content</p><p>content</p> <h3>sub heading</h3> // new section but under the <h2> section<h2>sub heading</h2> // new section, on the same level as previous <h2> section///////////An outline of the above codeh1  h2  p  p  h3 h2With the introduction of sectioning elements(nav, header, footer, article e.t.c), we can now write semantic html confidently. <section> tags should not serve as a total replacement for <div>. <div> has no semantic meaning, it is mainly used as hook for css to wrap content but does not create a section.<section> tags are used when you purposely(explcitly) want to define a section, they are not standalone content i.e they won’t make sense on their when taken out of your webpage. <section> tags kinda break the convention that h1-h6 define new sections. You can play with this code at html5 outliner<h1></h1>--- still creates a new section<section><h1>You can do this in section tags</h1></section><section><h2>this is now on the same level as previous section even though it contains a h1</h2></section><section><h3>this and the previous section are taken to be on the same level</h3></section>A list of some semantic html tags..<p>--- used to represent paragraphs in our content.<a>--- used to represent links, should not be used in place of buttons.. links can be styled to look like buttons..<button>--- used in forms and for attaching events(open and close menu on mobile screens).<header>--- used to signify the topmost part of a web page, usually contains the navbar and other introductory content.<nav>--- it contains the navigation links, there can be more than one <nav> in a page(no more divs yea😁)<article>---- it represents standalone content i.e if i have just this content does it make sense on its own without relating to the rest of the page.<section>--- represents a new idea, a new line of tought on a web page... needs a heading tag most-times<h1-h6> represents a new heading..<figure>-- should be used to wrap images that have captions or not... <figcaption>--- used with figure for wrapping captions.When we write semantic html, we kind of make the web more inclusive, people who use screen readers to access the web no longer get confused because our content now has meaning. Enough meaningless <div>s cluttering up the web.Imagine this<div>Main heading</div> // wrong on many levels<div>my button</div> // using <button> comes with many benefits like keyboard access,it can be reached via d tab key.. please no divs for button <div>my content</div> // sometimes people wrap content in divs<em>I need an itallic text</em> // this can be done with css please, use <em> for emphasis only.I’m not an expert in accessibility but what i’m sure of is that when you write semantic code, you have helped a little in pushing web accessibility.Semantic html — a good readWritten byEmmanuel ChinonsoI’m a self-taught front-end developer with love for design and anime.

Steuerstudies- Creating the most boring website,https://medium.com/@steuerstudies/steuerstudies-creating-the-most-boring-website-c70d9bc5fd9a?source=tag_archive---------64-----------------------,"Steuern,Students,Entrepreneurship,Web Development,Sparen","Over the next months I want to take you along on a journey where its destination has yet to be determined. At the end of May it was time for me to start a new project and I was in desperate need for a new idea, something exciting, something that will leave people in amazement once they have heard it. Something people will have daydreams about during work. Viciously staring at the clock to get home early.Sparkling with entrepreneurial spirit and sweeping people of their feet wondering how they could have managed their life without this invention so far. There was one thought popping to my head right away. Let’s create a website! Pretty sure I am the first one to think of such a disruptive market idea. To be honest a website is actually the only thing we need. But what is it all about then?A website explaining taxes to students. I will give you a moment to let that sink in.By now you probably know that we are on the verge of a life-changing invention. I do not want to brag or sound cocky here, but I was aiming for nothing less when I started this project — obviously. To start such a project, one would need to know how to create a website, have a lot of time and some knowledge about taxes would come in handy as well. Good thing that I have all these qualities.Since we are in this together, I think we should be honest to each other, so let me rephrase that last sentence a bit. I had to look up what HTML means and the last time I looked at how to code a website was probably in some high school lesson. CSS? Heard of it, but never used it. Publishing a website to the internet and buying a domain? No clue, at all. My knowledge about taxes? Optimistically speaking, maybe a bit above average, so at least I have that going for me.Seems like a lot of problems to start with, so it would probably be more comfortable to drop the project and do something else. True, but where is the fun in that? So, over the last two weeks I taught myself some basic HTML tags, tried to get the hang of CSS, read a lot about taxes. Then, after two very demanding weeks I could finally publish the first version of www.steuerstudies.de to the world. Turns out there are some legal requirements attached to uploading a website in Germany. Learning never stops.Buying the domains (I got five of them) cost me a whopping 12€ in total. It was time to have a financial talk with my investor on how to become profitable and pay back the money. Good thing is, that the guy has a great understanding of my situation and even offered some help. Our way of thinking is very similar almost feels like we are the same person.By sharing all this information with you, I feel like we have already created a bond and I do not want you to get hurt. For that reason, you will be sitting in the passenger seat where you can comfortably watch me taking all the risks while you lean back and enjoy the show. Fasten your seatbelt because this ride will be adventurous to say the least.Written bySteuerstudiesWe offer students an easy way of doing their taxes — simply by providing enough information in an easy to understand formatFollowSteuernStudentsEntrepreneurshipWeb DevelopmentSparenMore from SteuerstudiesFollowWe offer students an easy way of doing their taxes — simply by providing enough information in an easy to understand formatMore From MediumWhat To Do When Your Fears of Failure Come TrueSharon Singh Sidhu in Data Driven InvestorWhere Tech CEOs Go When They Need a Shoulder to Lean OnBloomberg Businessweek in Bloomberg BusinessweekDid the Ecosystem Really Make An Impact On Startups Growth in UAE?Eden Rabbie in The StartupThe 3 Metrics That Matter to Raise Your Series-ALars Kamp in The Startup4 things to keep in mind when building a sustainable social enterprise todayAngelique Moss in The StartupThe Not-So-Amazing Story of AmazonKemmy D in The StartupThere’s no business like slow businessPhoebe Assenza in rhetoricaFor People on the Verge of Launching an Innovation LabJeff MeadeAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

Je ne te ferai pas l’affront de te traduire et si tu ne sais pas de quoi je te parle, Google bon sang ! :DMais tu le sais aussi dans notre métier, la documentation :ça évolueil y en a une par langage, framework, librairie, etcchacune à son propre formatbref, ce n’est pas simple de s’y retrouver.Tu es d’accord avec moi ?Et que dirais tu, si je te disais qu’il est possible d’avoir toutes les documentations nécessaires pour développer sous la main ?Oui je sais, tu ne crois pas que cela soit possible et tu me prendrais pour un commercial qui veut te vendre du rêve !Bon on ralentit avec les gif’s car sinon je sens que je vais vous perdre.Revenons en à notre sujet : Zeal.Vu que de toute façon, je t’ai spoilé dans le titre de l’article, je laisse tomber le suspense. La solution s’appelle Dash dans le monde Mac et sous Windows le pendant s’appelle Zeal.Quels sont les avantages de ZEAL ?Le nombre de documentations couvertesA l’heure où je t’écris cet article, Zeal concentre 196 documentations !Pardon, le terme officiel n’est pas documentation, mais docsets !Il t’es également possible de créer ta propre documentation.Zeal t’assure la consultation off-line de ta documentation préféréeAutre avantage, une fois que tu installes la documentation souhaitée, elle est dispo off-line. Donc même si tu décides de partir en vacances dans un endroit sans internet, tu peux encore continuer à travailler.Oui, au final je ne suis pas sur que dans ce cas précis, ce soit un avantage. Enfin, tu as compris le principe !Le moteur de recherche intégréAlors là c’est le top, un mot clé et Zeal te propose toutes les occurences correspondantes et c’est assez pertinent. Cela va t’assurer un gain de temps énorme.Tu peux filtrer par docsets en utilisant ‘:’, par exemple :java:BaseDAOTu peux également effectuer une recherche dans plusieurs docsets en les séparant par une virgule:python,django:stringIl est intéressant de noter que tu peux lancer ta recherche documentaire via la ligne de commande :zeal python:pprintLes mises à jourZeal te permet de mettre à jour les documentations que tu as installé.En effet, dans la fenêtre des Docsets, sur l’onglet Installed, tu trouveras en bas les boutons Update, Update all pour cela. Ils s'activeront dès qu'une documentation sera disponible pour être mise à jour.Note que tu peux aussi supprimer une documentation dont tu n’aurais plus l’usage par exemple avec le bouton Remove.Installer ZEALSi tu es convaincu que Zeal peut te rendre de fiers services, alors tu peux passer à l’installation.Pour cela plusieurs choix s’offre à toi et cela va dépendre de ton OS (Windows ou Linux).Installer Zeal sous WindowsPour Windows, tu as une pléthore de possibilité :L’installation classique via un installeur WindowsTu télécharges le fichier .msi, tu doubles cliques dessus et puis voilà !La méthode élégante avec Chocolatey pour installer ZealChocolatey, “Choco” pour les intimesle package manager de Windows va te permettre d’installer Zeal en une ligne de commande ;-)Une fois que l’installation est terminée et s’est bien passée : ""The install of Zeal was successful."", tu peux taper sur le touche Windows (pas trop fort, hein !) et ensuite entrer Zeal, puis entrée.Zeal va alors se lancer.Il est également possible de lancer l’installation via Scoop qui est un installateur en ligne de commande.Tu peux si tu le souhaites avoir une version Zeal portable, si tu souhaites l’installer sur une clé USB par exemple ou si tu ne veux pas ou ne peux pas l’installer sur un ordinateur (au travail par exemple si il y a des stratégie d’entreprise t’empêchant d’installer un logiciel).Enfin, il est également possible d’installer les versions de développements avec les CI builds.Et sous Linux ?Sous Linux, tu peux tout simplement installer Zeal en ligne de commande en adaptant celle-ci en fonction de ton Linux préféré ;-)Je fais quoi, une fois que Zeal est installé ?Toi, on peut dire que tu vas à l’essentiel, le tact ce n’est pas ton truc. :-DMais tu as raison, l’efficacité tout simplement.Donc une fois que Zeal est installé, tu vas pouvoir aller installer les documentations qui te sont nécessaires, celles que tu vas utiliser au quotidien. Car oui, petite précision utile au premier lancement de Zeal aucune documentation n’est installée. Normal il ne peut pas deviner tes désirs secrets de documentation 😁Direction le menu Tools, 'Docsets...', rends toi sur l'onglet 'Available' et fais ton marché. Sélectionne chaque documentation qu'il t'es nécessaire et ensuite lance l'installation de la doc concernée en cliquant sur 'Download'.Un café plus tard, ta documentation est installée et consultable.Satisfait ? Oui ? Alors retournes bosser plutôt que de passer tout ton temps sur ce blog ! :DAttention !A présent, tu n’auras plus la possibilité d’utiliser l’excuse n° 404 du développeur :“Désolé chef, j’aurai bien voulu finir plus tôt, mais le site de la documentation était cassé. Par contre, j’ai updaté mes skills sur Street fighter ;-)”.Excuse 404 du développeurUne alternative ?ça tombe bien, un de mes fidèles lecteur m’a rappelé qu’il existait une solution en ligne (mais qui fonctionne aussi en hors-ligne), j’ai nommé : https://devdocs.io/Alors attention, certaines documentations peuvent paraître obsolète, notamment la documentation de Laravel dont la documentation s’arrête à la version 5 :-(Written byHappy To DevFollowWeb DevelopmentDocumentationZealTools For DevelopersMore from Happy To DevFollowMore From MediumWhy you should be using React FragmentsAaron S in JavaScript In Plain EnglishThe Good Documentation ChecklistJoyce Lin in Better PracticesStory Mapping: how to map features of the product around the user needsMoqodKeep your Documentation updated with Cypress and GitHub ActionsEma SurianoDonald Trump Won, No Matter What Happens NextJessica Wildfire in The Apeiron BlogThe Election Should Never Have Been This Closeumair haque in Eudaimonia and Co20 Things Most People Learn Too Late In LifeNicolas Cole in Better Advice(Why) There Was no Biden Landslideumair haque in Eudaimonia and CoAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

Object.create(new.brain)#205,https://medium.com/@kevbodyworks/object-create-new-brain-file-205-f7e394a59973?source=tag_archive---------68-----------------------,"Coding,Web Development","Describe one thing you’re learning in class today. Why do you think it will be important in your future web development journey?Today in class we learned out Object.create( ). It’s a static method on the object prototype that creates a new object with the prototype set to a certain object. This component to Javascript is a great way to use a method to an object, but not have that method applied to every single other object in an app or project you are working on.Create JavaScript Object with create methodObject.create() allowed to create object with more attribute options like configurable, enumerable, writable and value as shown belowlet car = Object.create(Object.prototype,  {    name:{      value: 'Fiesta',      configurable: true,      writable: true,      enumerable: false    },    maker:{      value: 'Ford',      configurable: true,      writable: true,      enumerable: true    }  });console.log(car.name)    //Output: FiestaprototypeEvery single object is built by constructor function.A constructor function makes an object linked to its own prototype.Prototype is an arbitrary linkage between the constructor function and object.Can you offer a use case for the new arrow => function syntax?An arrow function expression is a syntactically compact alternative to a regular function expression, although without its own bindings to the this, arguments, super, or new.target keywords. Arrow function expressions are all suited as methods, and they cannot be used as constructors.const materials = [‘hydrogen’,‘helium’,‘lithium’,beryllium’];console.log(materials.map(material => material.length));output: Array [8,6,7,9]How does this new syntax differ from the older function signature, function nameFunc(){}, both in style and functionality?Arrow functions, sometimes called ‘fat arrow’ functions, utilizing the new token =>. These functions two major benefits — a very clean concise syntax and more intuitive scoping and this binding.Explain the differences on the usage of foo between function foo() {} and const foo = function() {}One is a function declaration (function foo() {}), the other is a function expression (const foo = function() {}:). Function declarations are evaluated upon entry into the enclosing scope, before any step-by-step code is executed. Function expressions are evaluated as part of the step-by-step code, at the point where they appear (just like any other expression). That one creates a function with no name, which it assigns to the foo variable. — They are evaluated at different times, have different effects on the scope in which they’re defined, and are legal in different places.What advantage is there for using the arrow syntax for a method in a constructor?Gives you access to “this”, without having to bind to the class.Can you give an example for destructuring an object or an array?It’s called “destructuring assignment,” because it “destructurizes” by copying items into variables. But the array itself is not modified.const foo = [‘one’, ‘two’, ‘three’];const [reptile, amphibian, mammal]= fooconsole.log(reptile) // “one”console.log(amphibian) // “two”console.log(mammal)// “three”Explain Closure in your own words. How do you think you can use it? Don’t forget to read more blogs and videos about this subject.“Closures” are important because they control what is and isn’t in scope in a particular function, along with which variables are shared between sibling functions in the same containing scope. closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.To “use a closure”, define a function inside another function and expose it. To expose a function, return it or pass it to another function. The inner function will have access to the variables in the outer function scope, even after the outer function has returned.Closures are frequently used in JavaScript for object date privacy, in event handlers and callback functions, and in partial applications, currying, and other functional programming patterns.Austin Coding AcademyWritten byKevin ValiasFollowCodingWeb DevelopmentMore from Kevin ValiasFollowMore From MediumSummary of VueJS by Sarah Drasner (Part 7 of 7: Vuex)LimJavaScript Reduce in ActionAnthony Jimenez in JavaScript In Plain EnglishHow to Make a Simple Notes Viewer App with Vanilla JavaScriptValeriy Baranov in JavaScript In Plain EnglishJavaScript: Learn to Filter ArraySharafat Ahmed in The StartupNode.js FS Module — Truncating and Removing FilesJohn Au-Yeung in JavaScript In Plain EnglishUsing Webpack Code SplittingPaulund in JavaScript In Plain EnglishControlling Your JavaScript Program’s Workflow With Loops and BranchesJohn Au-Yeung in Better ProgrammingGood Parts of JavaScript — FunctionJohn Au-Yeung in The StartupAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

"<mark class=""tm tn kx"">React useEffect: 4 Tips Every Developer Should Know</mark>",https://medium.com/swlh/useeffect-4-tips-every-developer-should-know-54b188b14d9c?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"React Hook,React,Web Development,Useeffect,Hooks State","Let’s talk about useEffects in React Hooks! I’m going to share with you 4 tips you should have in mind when using useEffect.Use a useEffect for a single purposeIn React Hooks, you can have multiple useEffect functions. This is a great feature because, if we analyze how to write clean code, you’ll see that functions should serve a single purpose (much like how a sentence should communicate one idea only).Splitting useEffects into short and sweet single-purpose functions also prevents unintended executions (when using the dependency array).For example, let’s say you have varA that is unrelated to varB, and you want to build a recursive counter based on useEffect (with setTimeout) so let’s write some bad code:As you can see, a single change in any of the variables varA and varB will trigger an update in both variables. This is why this hook doesn’t work properly.Since this is a short example, you may feel that it’s obvious, however, in longer functions with more code and variables I guarantee you will miss this. So do the right thing and split your useEffect.In this case, it should become:Note: The code here is for example purposes only, which is meant to help you easily understand the problems of useEffect. Normally, when a variable depends on its’ previous state, the recommended way is to do setVarA(varA => varA + 1) instead. (credits to @Michael Landis for reminding me to add this note)Use custom hooks whenever you canLet’s take the example above again. What if the variables varA and varB are completely independent?In this case, we can simply create a custom hook to isolate each variable. This way, you get to know exactly what each function is doing to which variable.Let’s build some custom hooks then!Now each variable has its’ own hook. Much more maintainable and easy to read!Conditionally run useEffect the right wayOn the topic of setTimeout, let’s take the following example:For some reason, you want to limit the counter to a maximum of 5. There’s the correct way and the incorrect way.Let’s take a look at the incorrect way first:Although this works, bear in mind that clearTimeout will run on any change of varA, while setTimeout is conditionally run.The recommended way to run useEffect conditionally is to do a conditional return at the beginning of the function, like so:This is what you see Material UI using (as well as many others) and it makes sure you’re not running useEffect by mistake.Type out every prop inside useEffect in the dependency arrayIf you’re using ESLint, then you’ve probably seen a warning that comes from ESLint exhaustive-deps rule.This is crucial. When your app grows bigger and bigger, more dependencies (props) get added into each useEffect. To keep track of all of them and avoid stale closures, you should add each and every dependency into the dependency array. (Here’s the official take on this subject)Again, on the topic of setTimeout, let’s say you want to run setTimeout only once and add on to varA, much like the previous examples.You might be tempted to do the following incorrect example:Although this will do what you want, let’s take a moment to think, “what if your code gets bigger?”, or, “what if I want to change the code above to something else?”In that case, you’ll want to have the variables all mapped out, as it will be much easier to test and detect problems that might arise (like stale props and closures).The correct way should be:That’s it, folks.

Handling Asynchrony in Vue 3 / Composition API,https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/handling-asynchrony-in-vue-3-composition-api-part-1-managing-async-state-e993842ebf8f?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Vuejs,Vue,JavaScript,Front End Development,Web Development","Reactive state in vue-concurrencyA couple of months ago at work, we’ve decided to go all-in on Composition API with a new version of our product.And from what I can tell — looking around at new plugins appearing, all the discussions in the discord community — the composition API gets increasingly more popular. It’s not just us.Composition API makes a lot of things easier but it also brings some challenges as some things need to be rethought regarding how they fit into this new concept and it might take some time before the best practices are established.One of the challenges is managing state, especially when asynchrony is involved.I’ll try to showcase different approaches for this, including vue-concurrency, which I’ve created and that I maintain.Managing async stateYou might ask what’s there to manage? Composition API is flexible enough, this shouldn’t be a problem.The most typical asynchronous operation is doing an AJAX request to the server. In the past years, some generic issues of AJAX have been solved or mitigated. The callback hell was extinguished with Promises and those were later sugared into async/await. Async/await is pretty awesome and the code is a joy to read compared to the original callback hell spaghetti that was often written years before.But the fact, that things are much better now doesn’t mean that there’s no more space for improvement.Async function / Promises don’t track stateWhen you work with a promise, there’s a promise.then , promise.catch ,promise.finallyand that’s it. You cannot accessstatus or someisPending property and other state properties. That’s why you often have to manage this state yourself and with Composition API, your code might look like this:Here we pass refs like isLoading error data to the template. getUsers function is passed too to allow retrying the operation in case of an error. You might think the code above might still be quite reasonable and in a lot of cases, I’d agree with you. If the asynchronous logic isn’t too complicated, managing state like this is still quite doable.Yet I hid one logical mistake in the code above. Can you spot it?isLoading.value = false; happens only after the successful loading of data but not in case of an error. If the server sends an error response, the view would be stuck in spinner land forever.A trivial mistake but an easy one to make if you’re repeating logic like this over and over again.Eliminating boilerplate code in this case also means eliminating the chance of logical mistakes, typos and so on. Let’s look at different ways how to reduce this:Custom hook: useAsync, usePromise and so onYou might create your own hook, your own use function that would wrap the logic above. Or you might pick a solution from existing composition API utility libs:vue-use — useAsyncStateconst { state, ready } = useAsyncState(      axios        .get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')        .then(t => t.data),      {        id: null,      },    )Pros: simple, accepting plain promise. Cons: no way to retry.vue-composition-toolkit — useAsyncStateconst { refData, refError, refState, runAsync } = useAsyncState(() => axios('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1'))Pros: all state is covered. Cons: maybe verbose naming?<Suspense />Suspense is a new API, originally coming from React land that tackles this problem in a little bit different, quite a unique way.If Suspense is about to be used, we can start right away with using async / await directly in the setup function:But wait, there’s no <Suspense> being used so far! That’s because it would actually be used in a parent component relative to this one. Suspense effectively observes components in its default slot and can display a fallback content if any of the components promises are not fulfilled:In this case <Suspense> waits for promises to be fulfilled both in <Admins /> and <Users /> . If any promise rejects or if some other error is thrown, it’s captured in the onErrorCaptured hook and set to a ref.This approach has some benefits over the hooks outlined above, because those work via returning ref and therefore in your setup function you have to take into account the possibility that the refs are not filled with data yet:setup() {  const { refData: response } = useAsyncState(() => ajax('/users');  const users = computed(() => response.value                                 && response.value.data.users);  return { users };}With TS chaining operator it might become just response.value?.data.users . But still, with <Suspense /> you don’t need to deal with ref and you don’t even need a computed in this case!const response = await ajax('/users');const { users } = response.data;return { users }; Pros:Plain async / await directly in setup function!no need to use so many ref and computed !Cons:The logic, by design, has to be split into two (or more) components. Error handling and loading view have to be handled in the parent component.The fact that data loading is done in a child component and loading / error handling is done in a parent component might be counterintuitive at firstError handling needs to be done via some extra boilerplate code of onErrorCaptured and setting a ref manually.Suspense is handy for async rendering of data, but might not be ideal let's say for async handling of saving a form, conditionally disabling buttons and so on. A different approach is needed for that.vue-promised — <Promised />There’s another approach via a special component: <Promised /> . It is used in a more classical way — it accepts a promise in a prop rather than observing the state of child components as <Suspense /> does. Setting up the error and loading views is being done via named slots:Pros:Compared to <Suspsense />: possibility to have all the data / loading / error views in the same place.Cons:Same as <Suspense />: limited to async rendering, not ideal for other usecases such as submitting a form / toggling state of a button and so on.Compared to <Suspsence />you might need to use more ofref and computed .vue-concurrency — useTaskvue-concurrency —a plugin that I’ve created because I wanted to experiement with a new approach in Vue — borrows a well-proven solution from ember-concurrency to tackle these issues. The core concept of vue-concurrency is a Task object which encapsulates an asynchronous operation and holds a bunch of derived reactive state:There’s some more specific syntax here compared to the previous solutions, such as perform yield and isRunning , accessing last and so on. vue-concurrency does require a little bit of initial learning. But it should be well worth it. yield in this case behaves the same as await so that it waits for Promise resolution. perform() calls the underlying generator function.Pros:The Task is not limited to a template. The reactive state can be used elsewhere.The reactive state on a Task can easily be used for disabling buttons, handling form submissionsThe Task can always be performed again which allows retrying the operation easily.Task instance is PromiseLike and so it can be used together with other solutions, such as <Promised /> .Tasks scale up well for more complex cases because they offer cancelation and concurrency management — that makes it easy to prevent unwanted behavior and implement techniques like debouncing, throttling, polling.Cons:Compared to <Suspense /> some extra refs and computed might be needed.A new concept needs to be learned, even if quite minimal.ConclusionWhen we deal with async logic we are most likely using some kind of async functions and we deal with Promises. A state that would track running progress, errors, and resolved data then needs to be handled on the side.<Suspense /> allows eliminating excessive use of ref and computed and allows usage of async/await directly in setup . vue-concurrency brings a concept of a Task that is well flexible to be used in and out of templates and can scale up for more advanced scenarios.Up nextIn the next article, I’d like to take a deeper look into another drawback of Promises and how to work around it: lack of cancelation. I’ll show how vue-concurrency solves the issue with generator functions and what benefit it brings, but I’ll also outline other alternatives.Handling Asynchrony with Vue Composition API and vue-concurrency: Part 2 — canceling, throttling…In the previous article, I talked about promises and handling async state.

Building a data layer with Vue and Composition API,https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/building-a-data-layer-with-vue-and-composition-api-547cc9761b4c?source=tag_archive---------2-----------------------,"Vuejs,Web Development,Front End Development,JavaScript,Programming","When you are learning about a new frontend library, such as Vue or React you can read up a lot on certain best practices. There should be no problem finding resources on effective component composition, how to prevent performance bottlenecks, and the basics of state management, such as Redux, VueX, and so on.But then, there’s an area that is hard to find any information for and that’s how to build a good data layer. It’s common to put a lot of care to optimize and organize the view layer but the data layer might get neglected and becomes a frequent source of bugs.What is a data layer?By a data layer, in the context of frontend applications, I mean actually three layers:Fetch layer — code that contacts the server, using XHR, Fetch or Websockets. Usually a set of services (classes) or pure functions.Normalization / Serialization layer — code that processes incoming and outgoing data.Store layer — code that handles saving and accessing data to a client-side store.There’s surprisingly little information online on how to do these well. Maybe it’s because this logic is highly dependent on the design of your API and it’s hard to generalize. Yet still, I’ll try to provide some guidance.Do you even need a data layer?If a component directly does an ajax call and uses the raw response to render the data without storing it in any kind of client-side store that essentially means there’s no data layer involved.In some cases that is fine, in a lot of cases not at all.With this approach, problems might arise when…The same kind of request is being done in multiple places and the fetching logic needs to be reusedData coming from the server need to be processed.Some or all of the data might need to be reused elsewhereData need to be used again, for example when the user goes back to the previous route and triggering the same request again would not be optimal.There’s SSR involved and server state needs to be passed to the clientAs more and more of these need to be covered, the complexity can grow exponentially. Handling these issues directly in a component can easily grow out of hand and so you have to start moving the logic elsewhere and start generalizing it — and that’s how the data layer slowly starts to form.If your backend supports a conventional solution such as GraphQL or complies to a standard like JSON:API, you might save the majority or all of the work by using an existing data layer client, like Apollo or vuex-orm. Apollo requires a GraphQL backend, vuex-orm makes sense to use especially if your API is Restful.If not and your backend is unconventional, the job is on you. That’s the case I’m gonna cover.Fetch layerLet’s start with a component that does an ajax request with Axios and passes the data to the template.The component fetches and processes the result:This is a very low-level approach to contacting an API directly in a component. We see a bunch of refs being used such as data error isLoading . We pass those to the template together withfetchUsers function itself — so that it can be triggered again if needed (letting user to retry for example).Still, it’s a lot of code just to get some users and surely logic like this will be done at many places in the code.At this point, we could introduce a 3rd party solution such as a util function from vue-use, vue-composition-toolkit, vue-concurrency to improve it. Or we could start using Suspense and instead of setting refs, use async/await directly in setup and return a Promise.But for the purpose of demonstration, let’s refactor the previous code to a generic solution:The generic ref setting logic was moved to a custom hook called useAsync and only the case-specific logic is passed into it via callback. The callback is expected to fire up some ajax and return back data.Right away, I’ve also created a small normalizeUser function but there’s gonna be more work on that later.Notice also the processError . Using this function on all responses from the server allows us to move towards consistent and unified error handling.If this useAsync function is being used throughout the whole app, we’ve efficiently created a basic fetch layer. It might need some patches here and there due to the needs of serialization and store layers but the foundation is there.Serialization layerThe purpose of the serialization layer is to process incoming and outgoing data and do at least some of the following:Validating the response has the right format (maybe via a tool like io-ts)Changing the structure so it fits the UI needs (maybe to make the data easily iterable)Serializing date strings into date objectsAdjusting naming, perhaps changing snake_case to camelCaseIf needed, increasing naming consistency across different endpointsRemoving data we don’t need. That makes clear what kind of data FE actually uses. Smaller objects are easier to work with and might have performance impact as well (potentially there’s less reactivity tracking)Models sent in API responses tend to be quite big and have extra properties due to historical reasons or because those are needed by other clients — mobile apps, bots, 3rd party scripts.Basic normalization function could look like this:The output of this is a small and simple object that also provides some fallback values.The serialization function, would do the opposite. Turn the “normalized” user back to the original format. You would use this when sending the user back to your API, perhaps when editing personal data.Here this function is simpler, perhaps returning only a subset of things that the server expects the client to change. Images are left out because they are probably handled by a specific endpoint. In the case of a strict REST-API this would be okay to do with a PATCH request PATCH /users/1 . It would not work for a proper PUT request where the whole model is to be sent, not just a set of changes. Custom APIs usually also expect a set of changes, otherwise, they’d be RESTful:).Store layerIf the data are being fetched and normalized to the simplest format they are ready to be stored.At this point, there are some problems to figure out. How to store the data? How deeply nest? Store entities in a Map(Dict) structure or as an Array?Let’s return to our previous solution of useAsync + fetchUsers . We passed a callback inside useAsync which called Axios and triggered normalization function. This function should now do one more thing: besides returning the data, also pass them to the store. In VueX this would mean pass them into some mutation.This would be the most straightforward approach:What’s happening here? We’re using two getters from store — hasUsers and users . hasUsers is a simple bool returning function that checks if valid users are in store. In the beginning, it could just look for truthy value in store, non-empty-array, or object. Later on, it might get more complex, checking even time of last fetch (if the users were loaded too long ago, they’re not valid anymore).But at this point, we’re getting into a similar mess as before. As we start to handle more endpoints in new components, we’ll probably have to do something like this, over and over again:Check for valid value in the store, if present, return right away via store gettersAfter success, commit the data to the storeA similar-looking code would get repeated over and over again and every time we’d have to think how to name the getters and mutations.Couldn’t this be abstracted?Yes, this is something we wouldn’t have to deal with if we were lucky to have a GraphQL backend and had an Apollo Client or if we had a RESTful, perhaps even JSON:API backend and using vuex-orm. In GraphQL land we’d just perform queries, in REST land we’d deal with consistent resources in CRUD way and it would be abstracted via an ORM.If our API is custom, we can at least optimize logic that happens per every endpoint. Upon every endpoint call, we’re gonna check for existing value and maybe save a new one, or both (in case of a background reload).Could our useAsync hook take care of it?To some level yes, and at this point, we should probably rename it to something like useApi because it’s getting way more opinionated. Or better yet, compose the useApi on top of useAsync .There are two approaches to how to go around this: convention or configuration.Configuration: pass the getter and mutation names when calling useApi Convention: derive the getter and mutation names — from one endpoint name or from a function name.I usually prefer convention over configuration so I’ll go for the latter one.In this case, useApi composes on top of useAsync . It requires a named function to be passed and derives store getter and setter names from it. Therefore it checks hasUsers and if returns true, it returns the Usersgetter. After success, it calls the setUsersmutation. Hitting a new endpoint then becomes a routine of creating a function X and creating getters and setters in the store of hasX X and setX . An alternative to this approach would be passing getter and setter names into useApi but from my experience a convention reduces overhead.Folder structure?Going forward with this approach it’s clear there’s gonna be some extra code for the fetching, serializing, and storing data. It could be stored right by side in a component, but what’s usually better is to create some kind of data folder.Within that folder, there can be a list of files, one per every endpoint handler.data  createUser.js  findUser.js  createPost.js  findPost.js  login.js  Each of these would have a normalizeReponse function, fetch function and a couple of mutations and getter functions that would be passed to the store.If the logic bloats further, it’s possible to split things further:data  createUser    fetch.js    serialize.js    store.jsBut from my experience, it’s hardly ever needed to go this deep!Wrapping upI hope this small insight has been useful. In reality a custom useApi function probably tends to bloat up, but it IS possible to create something flexible, helpful, and easy to maintain — a custom high-quality data layer.In a lot o these steps you might find it useful to use vue-concurrency which I created exactly to make these things easier.

After that we just add our API route that we will be creating later to the URL endpoint with the help of native fetch method.Github Gist LinkHere in the code we just added our asynchronous function to onSubmit handler which ultimately hits our API endpoint we will make for our backend with the message and the email.BackendIn our backend we will be creating a simple server which will receive our object sent from our react app and trigger an email to the desired person with the details filled in UI. For this we will be using nodeMailer. Before we will start writing lets import our necessary packages we will useyarn add express nodemailer nodemonExpress is our framework of choice which is totally easy to get started. Nodemailer is the library we will be using sending emails to the desired address and nodemon to restart our server when we make changes to our code. Now lets create app.js file, where we will write all our code (We wont be creating a separate route neither .env files for simplicity and ease).We will now import our desired packages here and create a SMTP protocol in order for Nodemailer to send mails. This protocol is used by email hosts such as gmail, hotmail etc.Github Gist LinkNext, we will verify SMTP connection using the verify callback. And we will log our errors in console as well.Github Gist LinkFinally, we can add our POST route to send the content of the form that are filled in the UI. After all this are set we can have our working mini application which sends us email with the data filled for our Application UI. Lets take look at the final code we have hereConclusionYou have just built a form that can send message to out desired email address. This is one of the most common feature inside our application. We can tweak and make this much better if needed as well. You can also find the code in the repository here.Happy Coding!JavaScript In Plain EnglishEnjoyed this article?

Angular — Why we should avoid using public methods to design components,https://medium.com/@liutingchun_95744/angular-why-we-should-avoid-using-public-methods-to-design-components-f2ecbee12be2?source=tag_archive---------4-----------------------,"Angular,JavaScript,Software Development,Programming,Web Development","There are many ways to communicate between components. One of the most frequently used approaches is via public method calls. Many developers with a strong classic web development background (such as JQuery) like using this approach to design components. However, it is in fact, not a good practice in the world of Angular.Image from BlogchainIssue 1: It cannot utilize the Angular change managementOne of the most powerful features of Angular is the auto management of states. When the states in the component are updated, Angular helps to reflect them to the template automatically through change detection.@Component({  template: `{{value}}`})export class TestComponent {  value = 1;}For example, when value in class is updated, Angular will auto-update the value in the template. However, we won’t be able to utilize this feature when using components that rely on public methods. Here I would like to explain with an example:@Component({  selector: 'custom-button',  ...})export class CustomButtonComponent {  activated = false;    public setActivated(value: boolean) {    this.activated = value;  }}For this kind of components, we will have to keep a reference in order to access its public methods.@Component({  template: `<custom-button #customButton></custom-button>`})export class PageComponent {  @ViewChild('customButton') customButton: CustomButtonComponent;  doSomething() {    this.customButton.setActivated(true);  }}Now assume we have another component <filter> that has an activeFilter attribute. We want the button to be activated when activeFilter is not empty.@Component({  template: `    <filter       [activeFilter]=""activeFilter""      (activeFilterChange)=""onActiveFilterChange($event)""></filter>    <custom-button #customButton></custom-button>  `})export class PageComponent {  @ViewChild('customButton') customButton: CustomButtonComponent;  activeFilter = {};   onActiveFilterChange(activeFilter) {    this.activeFilter = activeFilter;    this.customButton.setActivated(activeFilter.length > 0);  }}The major problem is that we have to manage the state change ourselves. In this case, we have to call setActivated() manually whenever we know the state is changed. It means we have to find out all the trigger points of state change and put the setActivated() there. This will be a nightmare for bigger components that have more complicated business logic.By redesigning the component with the binding approach, we can make the code much cleaner:@Component({  selector: 'custom-button',  ...})export class CustomButtonComponent {  @Input() activated = false;}Now, we can do:@Component({  template: `    <filter [(activeFilter)]=""activeFilter""></filter>    <custom-button       [activated]=""activeFilter.length > 0""></custom-button>  `})export class PageComponent {  activeFilter = {};}The mutation of state can be chained through different components with the help of the Angular state management, which will help to reduce a lot of redundant codes. Most importantly, we no longer need to care about which part of the code may trigger data change. Angular can help us to ensure that whenever activeFilter is updated, the change will be reflected to the template. This highly reduce the complexity and maintenance overhead.Issue 2: It is not friendly for component inheritanceThe next issue is about component re-usability. Yet, it is not related to the component itself, but its parent that using it. Again, I would like to explain with an example:@Component({  template: `    <div>{{data | json}}</div>    <custom-button #customButton></custom-button>  `})export class PageComponent implements OnInit {  @ViewChild('customButton') customButton: CustomButtonComponent;  data = [];  constructor(    private testService: TestService  ) {}  ngOnInit() {    this.testService.getData()      .then(data => {        this.customButton.setActivated(data.length > 0);        this.data = data;      })  }}Assume we have a TestService that helps to retrieve data. We want the button to be activated when the retrieved data is not empty. The problem here is that the parent must maintain a element reference in order to call the public methods. It creates a strong coupling between the template and the class, which causes a lot of trouble for other developers who are trying to reuse this component through inheritance.@Component({  template: `    <div>{{data | json}}</div>    <div>Hi, I am a special page without button.</div>  `})export class SpecialPageComponent extends PageComponent {}When developers want to reuse these codes through inheritance, they must ensure the existence of the #customButton element even if they don’t need it. The SpecialPageComponent above will just throw a null error.We can remove this constraint by utilizing binding:@Component({  template: `    <div>{{data | json}}</div>    <custom-button [activated]=""data.length > 0""></custom-button>  `})export class PageComponent implements OnInit {  data = [];  constructor(    private testService: TestService  ) {}  ngOnInit() {    this.testService.getData()      .then(data => {        this.data = data;      })  }}Now the logic is stick with the template without any coupling with the class. Developers can reuse the code much more flexibly without the need to compromise the template design.ConclusionPublic methods are convenient to use, but they also cause other problems. Ideally, we should avoid using public methods when designing component, especially for assignments that can be easily replaced with bindings. For non-assignment public methods, we should try to avoid them in a higher level, such as utilizing content projection to avoid cross-component logic.On a side note, here is another article I have written previously about other approaches of communication between components.Angular — Four Ways for Communication Between ComponentsAn Angular application is consisted of many smaller components. Here is an introduction to four ways of communication…medium.comThanks for reading! Hope you find this article helpful.

Build an Isomorphic Application Using Deno and React Without WebPack,https://medium.com/swlh/build-an-isomorphic-application-using-deno-and-react-without-webpack-deno-by-example-6c748abb3243?source=tag_archive---------5-----------------------,"Typescript,Nodejs,Web Development,Server Side Rendering,Front End Development","Currently setting up a Server Side Render (SSR) application is a pain in nodejs. There are many scaffolds available for nodejs. But it comes with its own tech-depth and learning curves. This also includes hidden configurations of Webpack.All in all, when you give Webpack a chance, your encounter will rarely be a pleasant one.Read More: https://www.north-47.com/knowledge-base/webpack-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/1. OverviewAccording to the wiki, An isomorphic JavaScript(also known as Universal JavaScript) is described as JavaScript applications that run both on the client and the server.https://unsplash.com/photos/c_Hi3DzlC0gIf I say, you can build an entire SSR without setting up installing any external nodejs dependency. Would you believe it? I guess NO.However, In this tutorial, I will explain how to set up a simple SSR app without installing a single nodejs library or bundler. That also including a hydrate react app(isomorphic app).2. Set-upa. Start an app with npm inits: Don’t be afraid, To do things differently, we will not install any nodejs libraries. However, I still like npm as a task runner. So let’s use it. Create a folder SSR and init npm package.json$ md -p examples/ssr$ cd examples/ssr## init npm package$ npm init --y3. Backenda. Add Basic Deno server: Create server.tsx a file and add below codeimport { Application, Router } from ""https://deno.land/x/oak@v6.0.1/mod.ts"";const app = new Application();const router = new Router();router.get(""/"", handlePage);app.use(router.routes());app.use(router.allowedMethods());console.log(""server is running on http://localhost:8000/"");await app.listen({ port: 8000 });function handlePage(ctx: any) {  try {    ctx.response.body = `<!DOCTYPE html>  <html lang=""en"">  <head>    <meta charset=""UTF-8"">    <meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"">    <title>Document</title>  </head>  <body >    <div id=""root""><h1>Hello SSR</h1></div>  </body>  </html>`;  } catch (error) {    console.error(error);  }}note: We will use oak module here to create Deno server. You can create your own server. For that read my article Creating Routing/Controller in Deno Server(From Scratch)Add below command in package.json.""scripts"": {    ""start"": ""deno run --allow-net server.ts"",    ""test"": ""echo \""Error: no test specified\"" && exit 1"" },Run: Now we can run the application and verify on http://localhost:8000/.npm run startb. Add React Server Render: Now we can run the application. Let us add our first rendering code. For that, we need to ReactJS. Since Deno uses ES Module import, We will use the CDN hosted version of react and react-dom. For that, there is a good CDN provider https://jspm.org/jspm provides a module CDN allowing any package from npm to be directly loaded in the the browser and other JS environments as a fully optimized native JavaScript module.Now since we are going to write some TSX syntax(typescript JSX). We have to change the file extension of server.ts to server.tsx. Let’s do that and update package.json.mv server.ts server.tsx// package.json""scripts"": {    ""start"": ""deno run --allow-net server.tsx"",    ""test"": ""echo \""Error: no test specified\"" && exit 1""  },c. Add below lines in server.tsximport { Application, Router } from ""https://deno.land/x/oak@v6.0.1/mod.ts"";import React from ""https://dev.jspm.io/react@16.13.1"";import ReactDomServer from ""https://dev.jspm.io/react-dom@16.13.1/server"";const app = new Application();const router = new Router();router.get(""/"", handlePage);app.use(router.routes());app.use(router.allowedMethods());console.log(""server is running on http://localhost:8000/"");await app.listen({ port: 8000 });function App() {  return <h1>Hello SSR</h1>;}function handlePage(ctx: any) {  try {    const body = ReactDomServer.renderToString(<App />);    ctx.response.body = `<!DOCTYPE html>  <html lang=""en"">  <head>    <meta charset=""UTF-8"">    <meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"">    <title>Document</title>  </head>  <body >    <div id=""root"">${body}</div>  </body>  </html>`;  } catch (error) {    console.error(error);  }}Run the app again. You will see errors on the console.TS7026 [ERROR]: JSX element implicitly has type 'any' because no interface 'JSX.IntrinsicElements' exists.  return <h1>Hello SSR</h1>This error is due to missing typings to react. Since we do not include types to react. We have to let know the typescript compiler. How it should treat JSX(TSX) syntax.To suppress these errors, Add below lines.declare global {  namespace JSX {    interface IntrinsicElements {      [key: string]: any;    }  }}function App() {  return <h1>Hello SSR</h1>;}Now run the server again. You can see your first React SSR running on the browser. Nice!d. Adding Server Controller- Create Backend APIsLet’s move further and start adding a few core features for Server. Let’s add some server-side data for our app. For that, we will include a few routes on Oak Server. Oakconst router = new Router();router.get(""/"", handlePage);let todos: Map<number, any> = new Map();function init() {  todos.set(todos.size + 1, { id: Date.now(), task: ""build an ssr deno app"" });  todos.set(todos.size + 1, {    id: Date.now(),    task: ""write blogs on deno ssr"",  });}init();router  .get(""/todos"", (context) => {    context.response.body = Array.from(todos.values());  })  .get(""/todos/:id"", (context) => {    if (      context.params &&      context.params.id &&      todos.has(Number(context.params.id))    ) {      context.response.body = todos.get(Number(context.params.id));    } else {      context.response.status = 404;    }  })  .post(""/todos"", async (context) => {    const body = context.request.body();    if (body.type === ""json"") {      const todo = await body.value;      todos.set(Date.now(), todo);    }    context.response.body = { status: ""OK"" };  });app.use(router.routes());app.use(router.allowedMethods());Here in the above code, We have created three routes.GET /todos/ to get a list of the todosGET /todos/:id to todo by idPOST /todos/ create a new todofunction init() to create some initial dummy todos. You can use postman to try-out get and post data.4. Client-Side Appa. Add List Todos to React Client: Since now we have API to create todos and consume todos. Let’s list down all this on our react app. For that add the below-mentioned code.// server.tsxfunction App() {  return (    <div>      <div className=""jumbotron jumbotron-fluid"">        <div className=""container"">          <h1 className=""display-4"">ToDo's App</h1>          <p className=""lead"">This is our simple todo app.</p>          <ListTodos items={Array.from(todos.values())} />        </div>      </div>    </div>  );}function ListTodos({ items = [] }: any) {  return (    <>      <ul className=""list-group"">        {items.map((todo: any, index: number) => {          return (            <li key={index} className=""list-group-item"">              {todo.task}              <button                type=""button""                className=""ml-2 mb-1 close""                aria-label=""Close""              >                <span aria-hidden=""true"">&times;</span>              </button>            </li>          );        })}      </ul>    </>  );}function handlePage(ctx: any) {  try {    const body = ReactDomServer.renderToString(<App />);    ctx.response.body = `<!DOCTYPE html>  <html lang=""en"">  <head>    <meta charset=""UTF-8"">    <meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"">    <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css"" integrity=""sha384-ggOyR0iXCbMQv3Xipma34MD+dH/1fQ784/j6cY/iJTQUOhcWr7x9JvoRxT2MZw1T"" crossorigin=""anonymous"">    <title>Document</title>  </head>  <body >    <div id=""root"">${body}</div>  </body>  </html>`;Update all the changes and run the app. You will see a list of Todos containing two rows of initial data. You can use curl post data to route POST/todos/ to create new records. Once you add a post, refresh the page, You will see added new post data.curl --header ""Content-Type: application/json"" \  --request POST \  --data '{""task"":""Create postman script""}' \  http://localhost:8000/todos/If you noticed, I have added basic bootstrap to make UI nicer. You can use some other CSS library.Tada! Now you have running the SSR app. You can replace the in-memory todos store to any persistent database. The result will be the same.Now time to add some interactive behavior in Our react app(client-side). But before doing that, let’s move our react code to some separate file app.tsx.b. Create a file app.tsx:import React from ""https://dev.jspm.io/react@16.13.1"";declare global {  namespace JSX {    interface IntrinsicElements {      [key: string]: any;    }  }}function App({ todos = [] }: any) {  return (    <div>      <div className=""jumbotron jumbotron-fluid"">        <div className=""container"">          <h1 className=""display-4"">ToDo's App</h1>          <p className=""lead"">This is our simple todo app.</p>          <ListTodos items={todos} />        </div>      </div>    </div>  );}function ListTodos({ items = [] }: any) {  return (    <>      <ul className=""list-group"">        {items.map((todo: any, index: number) => {          return (            <li key={index} className=""list-group-item"">              {todo.task}              <button                type=""button""                className=""ml-2 mb-1 close""                aria-label=""Close""              >                <span aria-hidden=""true"">&times;</span>              </button>            </li>          );        })}      </ul>    </>  );}export default App;Notice the change in the App component. Since we do not have direct access to todos now, We need to pass data as props while rendering it. Corresponding changes have been done for ListTodos.// server.tsximport React from ""https://dev.jspm.io/react@16.13.1"";import ReactDomServer from ""https://dev.jspm.io/react-dom@16.13.1/server"";import App from ""./app.tsx"";/// rest of the codefunction handlePage(ctx: any) {  try {    const body = ReactDomServer.renderToString(      <App todos={Array.from(todos.values())} /> // change here to pass todos as props    );// rest of the code}Run the app and see changes on the browser, If all good there will be no change in the final output.c. Adding delete functionality on client-side// app.tsxfunction ListTodos({ items = [] }: any) {  const [deletedIdxs, setDeletedIdxs] = (React as any).useState([]);  return (    <>      <ul className=""list-group"">        {items.map((todo: any, index: number) => {          const deleted = deletedIdxs.indexOf(index) !== -1;          return (            <li              key={index}              className=""list-group-item""              style={{ color: deleted && ""red"" }}            >              {todo.task}              <button                type=""button""                className=""ml-2 mb-1 close""                aria-label=""Close""                onClick={() => setDeletedIdxs([...deletedIdxs, index])}              >                <span aria-hidden=""true"">&times;</span>              </button>            </li>          );        })}      </ul>    </>  );}Once you do the above changes and try to delete by clicking on cross-button. You will see no change in UI. By code, it should turn the element color to red. So what could be the reason for that?Answer: HydrateSince we are using ReactDomServer.renderToString the library which converts React app to string. So we lose all JS capabilities. To re-enable react js on the client-side. For that React provides you Hydrate module(API). This hydrate API re-enable the react feature on the client-side again. This makes our app Isomorphic app. More: HydrateAdding hydrate is a tough task to do. But Awesome Deno shines well here too. Deno provides Bundle API to convert a script to js. We will use Deno.bundle to create hydrate js for the client-side.d. Create a new file client.tsx and add below codes:// client.tsximport React from ""https://dev.jspm.io/react@16.13.1"";import ReactDom from ""https://dev.jspm.io/react-dom@16.13.1"";import App from ""./app.tsx"";(ReactDom as any).hydrate(<App todos={[]} />, document.getElementById(""root""));Add below codes to compile and convert client.tsx to serve as a route in our server.// server.tsx// initial codeconst [_, clientJS] = await Deno.bundle(""./client.tsx"");const serverrouter = new Router();serverrouter.get(""/static/client.js"", (context) => {  context.response.headers.set(""Content-Type"", ""text/html"");  context.response.body = clientJS;});app.use(router.routes());app.use(serverrouter.routes());// rest of the codefunction handlePage(ctx: any) {  try {    const body = ReactDomServer.renderToString(      <App todos={Array.from(todos.values())} /> // change here to pass todos as props    );    ctx.response.body = `<!DOCTYPE html>  <html lang=""en"">    <!--Rest of the code -->    <div id=""root"">${body}</div>    <script  src=""http://localhost:8000/static/client.js"" defer></script>  </body>  </html>`;  } catch (error) {    console.error(error);  }Since we are using unstable API deno.bundle, You have to update package.json and add more flags. Same time, We are using DOM with typescript. So we have to add custom tsconfig.json.// package.json{  ""scripts"": {    ""start"": ""deno run --allow-net --allow-read --unstable server.tsx -c tsconfig.json"",    ""test"": ""echo \""Error: no test specified\"" && exit 1""  }}e. Create a filetsconfig.json:// tsconfig.json{  ""compilerOptions"": {    ""target"": ""es6"",    ""module"": ""commonjs"",    ""lib"": [      ""DOM"",      ""ES2017"",      ""deno.ns""    ],    ""strict"": true,    ""esModuleInterop"": true,    ""skipLibCheck"": true,    ""forceConsistentCasingInFileNames"": true  }}Note: You can use bundler as CLI to convert client.tsx before even starting the server. However, I just wanna show a cool way of doing it. So I use Deno.bundle on runtime.4. Final TouchInitialize initial state: Once you do all the above-mentioned changes, Re-Run app. You will notice the list is the visible and hidden same time. This is because we react hydrate start working and it is trying to re-initialize the app. So all the data we render from the server is gone to persist data we need to pass data as application initial data. There are a lot of patterns to pass initial data. We will use the simple window global data.Let’s start data on the window after making below changes on the given files.// server.tsxfunction handlePage(ctx: any) {  try {    const body = ReactDomServer.renderToString(      <App todos={[]} />    );    ctx.response.body = `<!DOCTYPE html>    <title>Document</title>    <script>      window.__INITIAL_STATE__ = {""todos"": ${JSON.stringify(        Array.from(todos.values())      )}};    </script>  </head>Let’s update client.tsx accordingly.// client.tsx// initial codesdeclare global {  var __INITIAL_STATE__: any;}import App from ""./app.tsx"";const { todos } = window.__INITIAL_STATE__ || { todos: [] };(ReactDom as any).hydrate(  <App todos={todos} />,  document.getElementById(""root""));Now you have a running, working SSR/Isomorphic App that is fully written in Deno. We didn’t use any nodejs/npm modules or WebPack.Thanks for reading this tutorial. Please follow me to support me.

How to Use Chrome DevTools More Efficiently,https://medium.com/better-programming/how-to-use-chrome-devtools-more-efficiently-6b399c335397?source=tag_archive---------6-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Front End Development,JavaScript,Google Chrome","The first time I was introduced to Chrome DevTools I didn’t understand how powerful they are. As I used them in more projects, it became clear that they were doing a lot to help me to find errors quickly.In this article I want to share tools that can help new developers.Our console inside the Chrome browser.The Power of $0 and $_ :How to use $0:Basic html file inside our Chrome DevToolsClick on the element that you want to check.Go to your console and write $0 and press “Enter”.Now you can use all the properties on these elementYou can also use $0 until $4 and you will get all the elements that you were looking at.Demo using $0:Demo using $_:The main goal of $_ inside the console is to use the last value that was executed in the console. In this demo I demonstrate how to work with $_:The Power of copy() :Copy() is a unique function in Chrome DevTools.One of the reasons for using the copy() function is if somebody is sending you a JSON file or you are receiving a JSON object from the API . For our example, let’s say that someone is sending you a JSON file and you need to work with this object. To get this object to your notepad, or any editor, you need to write the following inside the console:copy($_) — $_ if it’s the last thing that you wrote inside your console.copy(“rand_name”)- rand_name- where you assign this variable to your object.Hit “Enter”.Now go to your editor and Ctrl+V:const jsonResponse is our JSON file.The command that you need to write in your console, as you can see in the image, is copy(). Inside the brackets you can use $_ or the const variable. The last step is to copy to your editor.The Power of BreakpointsOne of the most powerful features are breakpoints. Using breakpoints can help you find the errors inside your code. If you are more familiar with C#, C ,C++, or other programming languages, you probably know this as a debugger.Our DevTools when we want to use our breakpointsTo use the breakpoints tool open your project in Chrome, then (right click) look for inspect (Windows) or inspect element (Mac). The window will be open. There is a navbar at top of the screen — navigate to “Sources” and you will get the window shown in the image above.Right side of the screen — where you can see all your projects files.Middle page — where you can see your code , and where to put your breakpoints.Left side of the screen — where you have your breakpoints, and more tools to guide you over your code. For example:The watch — filed is for you to write any variables that you want to see during your debugging.Call stack — is a stack of all the functions that you’re using. I’m using this feature but as you can see there is more.Dashboard: To work with breakpoints, from right to leftThe Blue Triangle sign — will continue to execute the code if there are no breakpoints ahead. If there are more breakpoints it will jump to the next one in the execution order.Curly arrow — its main purpose is to move line by line inside your code.Arrow bottom — main purpose is to go inside a function during your code (if needed).Arrow up — use this to get out from a function to your previous line of code.There are other signs but you don’t need them to work with breakpoints.To use the breakpoints click on the line of code that you want to put your breakpoints (the red dot in the demo below).DemoConclusionBegin your journey as a new web developer with Chrome DevTools.

A quick introduction to the “Property Descriptor” of the JavaScript objects,https://medium.com/jspoint/a-quick-introduction-to-the-property-descriptor-of-the-javascript-objects-5093c37d079?source=tag_archive---------7-----------------------,"JavaScript,Programming,Nodejs,Web Development,Tutorial","(source: unsplash.com)When we create a JavaScript object, whether using object literal syntax or some other means and add some properties to it, each property (key) gets a default property descriptor. A property descriptor is a simple JavaScript object associated with each property of the object that contains information about that property such as its value and other meta-data.(simple-object.js)In the above example, we have created a plain JavaScript object myObj using literal syntax with myPropOne and myPropTwo properties. We have given these properties some initial values, viz. 1 and 2 respectively.Now, if we write a new value to myPropOne property like below, the operation will be successful and we will get the changed value.(simple-object-override-value.js)To access the property descriptor of property, we need to use a static method provided by the Object. The Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor method returns the property descriptor of the prop which is the property name on the obj object.Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(obj, prop);Own here means return the property descriptor of prop property only if that property belongs to the object obj and not on its prototype chain. If the property prop doesn’t exist on obj, it returns undefined.💡 If you want to know what prototype or prototype chain is, read my lesson on JavaScript’s prototype-based inheritance.(object-peek-descriptor.js)The Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor method returns an object with keys describing the setting and current value of the property. The value property of the property descriptor is the current value of the property, writable is whether the user can assign a new value to the property, enumerable is whether this property will show up in enumerations like for in loop or for of loop or Object.keys etc.The configurable property tells whether the user has permission to change property descriptor such as to change the value of writable and enumerable settings.💡 Property descriptor also has get and set keys as well which are middleware functions to return value or update value, but these are optional.To create a new property on an object or update existing property with a custom descriptor, we use Object.defineProperty. Let’s modify an existing property myPropOne with writable set to false, which should disable writes to myObj.myPropOne.(object-descriptor-readonly-field.js)As you can see from the above error, our property myPropOne is not writable, hence if a user is trying to assign a new value to it, it will throw an error.💡 If Object.defineProperty is updating existing property descriptor, then original descriptor will be merged with new modifications. Object.defineProperty returns the original object myObj after changes.Let’s see what will happen if we set enumerable descriptor key to false.(object-descriptor-unenumerable-field.js)As you can see from the above result, we can’t see myPropOne property of the object in Object.keys enumeration.When you define a new property on object using Object.defineProperty and pass empty {} descriptor, the default descriptor looks like below.{    value: undefined,    writable: true,    enumerable: false,    configurable: false}Now, let’s define a new property with custom descriptor where configurable descriptor key is set to false. We will keep writable to false and enumerable to true with value set to 3.(object-descriptor-non-configurable-field.js)By setting configurable descriptor key to false, we lost the ability to change descriptor of our property myPropThree. This is very helpful if you don’t want your users to manipulate the recommended behavior of an object.get (getter) and set (setter) for a property can also be set in property descriptor with these exact keys. But when you define a getter, it comes with some sacrifices. You can not have an initial value or value key on the descriptor at all because the getter will return the value of that property. You can not use writable key on descriptor as well, because your writes are done through the setter and you can prevent writes there. Have a look at MDN documentation of getter and setter.💡 You can create and/or update multiple properties at once using Object.defineProperties which takes two arguments. First argument is target object on which properties has to be added/modified and second argument is object with key as property name and value as its property descriptor. This function returns the target object.Have you tried Object.create function to create objects? This is the easiest way to create an Object with no or a custom prototype. It is also one of the easier ways to create objects from scratch with custom property descriptors.Object.create function has the following syntax.var obj = Object.create( prototype, { property: descriptor, ... } )Here prototype is an object which will be the prototype of the obj. If prototype is null, then obj won’t have any prototype. When you define an empty or non-empty object with var obj= {} syntax, by default, obj.__proto__ points to Object.prototype hence obj has the prototype of Object class.This is similar to using Object.create with Object.prototype as the first argument (prototype of the object being created).(object-proto-peek.js)But when we set the prototype to null, we get below error.(object-null-proto.js)(thatisuday.com / GitHub / Twitter/ StackOverflow / Instagram)JsPointJavaScript and the WebFollow102 Some rights reservedJavaScriptProgrammingNodejsWeb DevelopmentTutorial102 claps102 clapsWritten byUday HiwaraleFollowSenior Software Engineer (JS • Go • Dart • Python) / thatisuday.com ☯ github.com/thatisuday ☯ thatisuday@gmail.comFollowJsPointFollowA collection of essential articles for JavaScript, WebAssembly, TypeScript, Node.js, Deno, and Web development in general.FollowWritten byUday HiwaraleFollowSenior Software Engineer (JS • Go • Dart • Python) / thatisuday.com ☯ github.com/thatisuday ☯ thatisuday@gmail.comJsPointFollowA collection of essential articles for JavaScript, WebAssembly, TypeScript, Node.js, Deno, and Web development in general.More From MediumAnimated Active Menu Highlights in VueJS — Daily Vue Tips #1Matt MaribojocReact Native: Stack Navigation and HeaderMubashir AliJWT Authentication & Authorization in NodeJs/Express & MongoDB REST APIs(2019)Frank Atukunda in The StartupUnderstanding Arrow Functions once and for all!Madhav Bahl in JavaScript In Plain EnglishAvoiding Shared Mutable State in JavaScript by Shallow Copying DataJohn Au-Yeung in Better ProgrammingJavaScript Best Practices — Classes and ModulesJohn Au-Yeung in The StartupJavaScript: Double (==) vs Triple (===) EqualsBahay Gulle Bilgi in The StartupHow to improve the mobile responsiveness of your websiteMariequittelier in JavaScript In Plain EnglishLearn more.Medium is an open platform where 170 million readers come to find insightful and dynamic thinking."
Dockerizing Angular App With NodeJS Backend — Typescript Version,https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/dockerizing-angular-app-with-nodejs-backend-typescript-version-4136a3ce019e?source=tag_archive---------8-----------------------,"Docker,Angular,Programming,Web Development,Typescript","Photo by Bernd Dittrich on UnsplashDocker is an enterprise-ready container platform that enables organizations to seamlessly build, share, and run any application, anywhere. Almost every company is containerizing its applications for faster production workloads so that they can deploy anytime and sometimes several times a day. There are so many ways we can build an Angular App. One way is to dockerize the Angular app with nodejs backend and create a docker image so that we can deploy that image any time or sometimes several times a day.In this post, we look at the example project and see the step by step guide on how we can dockerize the Angular app with nodejs as a server.IntroductionExample ProjectDockerizing the AppRunning The App on DockerSummaryConclusionIntroductionNowadays, it’s very common to dockerize and deploy the Docker image in the production with the help of container orchestration engines such as Docker Swarn or Kubernetes. We are going to Dockerize the app and create an image and run it on Docker on our local machine. We could also push that Image into Docker hub and pull it whenever and wherever we need it.Here is the complete guide on how to develop an Angular app with nodejs as a backend server. If you are not familiar with the process or you want to know before studying this guide, I would recommend you going through it.Javascript VersionHow To Develop and Build Angular App With NodeJSTypescript VersionHow To Develop and Build Angular App With NodeJS — Typescript VersionPrerequisiteAs a prerequisite, you have to install Docker for Desktop (whatever your OS is). Please follow this link to install Docker on your laptop. Once installed you can check the Docker info or version with the following commands.docker infodocker --versionExample ProjectThis is a simple example project with the Angular and nodejs server. You can create users. As you create users, the count can be updated on the right side and retrieve all the users with the button.Example projectHere is a Github Link for this example project that you can on your local machine.// clone the projectgit clone https://github.com/bbachi/angular-nodejs-typescript-example.git// Angular Codecd my-appnpm installnpm start// API codecd apinpm installnpm run start:devIf you want to create a Docker image and run it on the local Docker, here are the steps.// create an imagedocker build -t angular-node-ts-image .// running on Imagedocker run -d -it -p  3080:3080 --name ang-node-ui angular-node-ts-imageDockerizing the AppWe use the multi-stage builds for efficient docker images. Building efficient Docker images are very important for faster downloads and lesser surface attacks. In this multi-stage build, building an Angular project and put those static assets in the dist folder is the first step. The second step involves building an API server bundle and the third step involves copying from these two stages and run the code.Let’s build an image with the Dockerfile. Here are the things we need for building an image.Stage 1Start from the base image node:10We are naming this stage as ui-buildMake the working directory as /usr/src/appWe need to copy Angular code into the Docker file system and install all the dependencies.Copy all the source files.Angular uses Angular/CLI to build the app. So, install CLI and install all the dependencies.Run npm run build to build the Angular App and all the assets will be created under dist a folder within a my-app folder.Stage 2Start from the base image node:10We are naming this stage as server-buildMake the working directory as /usr/src/appCopy all the api code into Docker file systemInstall all the dependencies and build the server codeStage 3Start from the base image node:10Make the working directory as /usr/src/appCopy all the code from the stage ui-build to the Docker file system ./my-app/distCopy all the code from the stage server-build to the Docker file system ./Finally, have this command node api.bundle.js with the CMD. This automatically runs when we run the image.Here is the complete DockerfileDockerfileLet’s build the image with the following command.// build the imagedocker build -t angular-node-ts-image .// check the imagesdocker imagesRunning The App on DockerOnce the Docker image is built. You can run the image with the following command.// run the imagedocker run -d -p  3080:3080 --name ang-node-ui angular-node-ts-image// check the containerdocker psDocker file systemYou can access the application on the web at this address http://localhost:3080.The app running on the port 3080Exec into a running containerYou can exec into the running container with this command and explore the file system.docker exec -it ang-node-ui /bin/shLogsYou can view the logs form the docker with the following commanddocker logs <container id>docker logsSummaryNowadays, it’s very common to dockerize and deploy the Docker image in the production with the help of container orchestration engines such as Docker Swarn or Kubernetes.We use the multi-stage builds for efficient docker images.Building efficient Docker images are very important for faster downloads and lesser surface attacks.We maintain separate folders for Angular and nodejs code for maintainability, clean architecture, etc.Since the API code is in typescript you need a webpack to transpile the typescript code into the javascript bundle.ConclusionAlways use multi-stage builds with this type of architecture. It makes Docker images smaller and less prone to attacks.Bachina LabsTutorials Ranging from Beginner guides to Advanced | Never…Follow178 Sign up for BB Tutorials & ThoughtsBy Bachina LabsTutorials Ranging from Beginner guides to advanced on Frontend, Backend, Blockchain, Docker, k8s, DevOps, Cloud,AI, ML.

Consuming file data in Next.js API routes with Formidable,https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/formidable-with-next-js-298c913517a0?source=tag_archive---------9-----------------------,"React,Nextjs,Programming,JavaScript,Web Development","Photo by Daria Nepriakhina on UnsplashWe will be checking on how we can use Formidable without the use of custom server, to send form data from the client side, to our backendThis example assumes you already comfortable in sending the file from the client side to your backend, a basic example of sending a file from client side will be :Next.js APIThe nice thing about Next.js API routes is that you can achieve many things without any use of a custom server. We’ll set up our api route that will handle our incoming form data.This is a basic setup of an api route in Next.js, in it we have req(request), in which there are built in middlewares which help us to parse the request in order to get access to the cookies, body of the request, queries in the request and all that jazz.Then we also have res(response), which is our response helper, to send back a response after we done doing whatever we want to do with the request sent to this route.if you hit that endpoint; /api/uploadApi, you’ll get the ‘file received’ response.Next.js also gives us an option to configure our api, with regards to the maximum size of the body parsed, and we can also tell it if we want our body parsed or not, in this instance, we need our form data as a stream, thus we’ll have to disable the bodyparserNow that our setup is ready we can install all the dependencies will need to get our form data, which is micro and formidable.Our file will now look like this:Micro will resolve the data for us, and formidable will handle all the incoming stream, then we store all the data to our ‘data’ variable. Should you want to send it to a database, you can create a readable stream and append it to form data then send it.JavaScript In Plain EnglishNew JavaScript + Web Development articles every day.Follow16 ReactNextjsProgrammingJavaScriptWeb Development16 claps16 clapsWritten byGift RetyuFollowFollowJavaScript In Plain EnglishFollowNew JavaScript + Web Development articles every day.FollowWritten byGift RetyuFollowJavaScript In Plain EnglishFollowNew JavaScript + Web Development articles every day.More From MediumHere’s A Simpler Alternative to ReduxSpencer in Better ProgrammingAdding Firebase Auth to your Nuxt.js AppShivansh Vij in JavaScript In Plain EnglishBest Practices for Writing Vue Apps — Error PreventionJohn Au-Yeung in The StartupIIFEs in JavaScript — Use casesKoteswar Rao in The StartupNode: Is it a Language or a Framework?Prateek Singh in JavaScript In Plain EnglishHow to Make a Responsive App with React and BootstrapJohn Au-Yeung in Better Programming5 Questions to Test Your JavaScript KnowledgeRaz Gaon in JavaScript In Plain EnglishHow to use a Firebase Function to handle incoming WebhookMusa Kökçen in Plus Minus OneLearn more.Medium is an open platform where 170 million readers come to find insightful and dynamic thinking."
Handling Asynchrony with Vue Composition API and vue-concurrency,https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/handling-asynchrony-with-vue-composition-api-and-vue-concurrency-part-2-canceling-throttling-4e0305c82367?source=tag_archive---------10-----------------------,"Vuejs,JavaScript,Front End Development,Web Development,Programming","Visualization of a restartable task in vue-concurrencyIn the previous article, I talked about promises and handling async state. This article will point towards another weak point of promises: lack of cancelation.It’s easy to think that you have no need for cancelation. Paradoxically, because with the current default tools in JavaScript cancelation is hard, it’s not often talked about and recommended. But there indeed are use cases when cancelation is a powerful tool and not just for some advanced use cases, but also in common features such as debouncing and polling or just to make asynchronous logic overall more safe. You just need the right tool.Promises are not cancellable and therefore you also can’t cancel an async function. One way to go around this is to make use of generators. Generator functions, like async functions, have a special syntax.function myFun * () {  yield foo();  return 'bar';}Instead of async we mark the function with * and instead of await we write yield . But then generator functions are more flexible — their behavior is to a big degree defined by the consumer they are passed into. You can create yuor own handler of generator functions but most commonly you’d just rely on a 3rd party library. For example CAF — Cancellable Async Flows. Generator functions passed into CAF start to behave like async functions — yielding waits for promise resolution. But on top of that, it’s possible to cancel() and abort the execution early.vue-concurrency takes use of CAF and wraps the whole logic into a handy reactive object: Task.PollingA typical use case when the cancelation is very handy: polling. When you poll, you do a certain operation in a specified interval for a long time or until a specific action. The most direct approach would be using setInterval but then you need to make sure to also clearInterval at the right time. After all, your Vue app is probably behaving like a single page application and you don’t want your polling to continue when the user navigates to a different page for example. So yes you could do a few defensive checks and then clear interval in onBeforeUnmount composition API hook. But with vue-concurrency it gets a bit more straightforward:The while (true)is something that’s rarely seen in JavaScript. But with cancellation it becomes viable. Poll task waits for the new data, then waits 5 seconds over and over again. The task is canceled automatically when the component where it is used is unmounted. So this code is safe to do, no need to deal with setInterval.Right away on the task, there’s also the drop() modifier. It makes things a bit more bullet-proof, making sure that task can’t run multiple instances at the same time. In this case, it means polling can only be running once. If the task might need to start again, but with different arguments, perhaps checking a different endpoint, it could be set as restartable() instead. A restartable task would cancel the previous task instance and start a new one.And that’s it! If needs be, we can also update our code further to allow canceling and resuming manually:As we pass the task to the template, we get the usual benefits of it. In the template we can check if task.isRunning and we can resiliently display lastSuccessful value (assuming some API calls might fail):DebouncingShowing search results as the user has finished typing is a common feature nowadays and provides a good UX. The direct approach is to trigger a timer after a keypress and reset the timer if it’s already running. And if yo u wouldn’t write this logic yuorself, you’d generally just wrap your function in some existing debounce utility, for example from lodash.With vue-concurrency and tasks, the operation again gets a bit more straightforward and safe.We can create a task that is similar to the previous one:The difference here is that timeout() is at the beginning of the task call. We wait for 700ms and then perform an AJAX request. If the task is performed again (and it will be for every keypress), the previous task call is canceled and a new task instance is created because the task is restartable() . That effectively gives us debouncing. This makes things less magical than using a mysterious debounce function and it also gives you more flexibility. If necessary, the waiting time could be dynamic (perhaps not waiting on certain keys!… or waiting longer).ThrottlingWhat if we want to show search results while user is typing, not after? In that scenario, it’s still probably not doable to perform a search for every key press. We want to limit the search API calls a certain way. That’s where throttling comes into play. Let’s say we want to search as the user is typing, but only every 200ms. We could utilize the drop() modifier from the first (polling) example but it wouldn’t be ideal. keepLatest() is better, fit. Just like drop() it also prevents the task to run multiple instances in parallel, but it makes sure the last instance is eventually performed. This is ideal for throttling.Yes, the only difference here is the different number passed to timeout and using keepLatest() instead of restartable() !Up nextNot literally part of this series but I have one more article that fits into this area: building a basic data layer:Building a data layer with Vue and Composition APIWhen you are learning about a new frontend library, such as Vue or React you can read up a lot on certain best…medium.comThanks for reading!JavaScript In Plain EnglishNew JavaScript + Web Development articles every day.Follow60 1 VuejsJavaScriptFront End DevelopmentWeb DevelopmentProgramming60 claps60 claps1 responseWritten byMartin MalindaFollowCreative through code.

How I Finally Understood Redux,https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/how-i-finally-understood-redux-ffb7666fab43?source=tag_archive---------11-----------------------,"Redux,Redux Thunk,React,JavaScript,Web Development","Photograph by Alex Iby from UnsplashI have been in charge of setting up a new frontend at work for a new project. Initially I created a new React app using create-react-app, and decided to use React Context API for handling data in the app. I would fetch data when loading the page, save it a in a global state, and then populate it throughout the app using Context. This worked in the beginning, but I quickly realised that It got quite complicated handling a lot of data after a while. I also stored information about ui state in at a Context level, for things like if sidebars and navigation menus are open.We also wanted to be able to listen to events sent by our backend API to then update state with new data throughout the app. Since we also didn’t store every entity at the Context level this got quite complicated. We started having multiple sources of truths and manually managing a lot of state updating. I decided to start looking towards Redux — a global state management tool I had been using at my previous job. I hadn’t had a lot of good experiences with it, and I was quite ___ towards actually taking a look at it again. However, I spun up a playground for trying it out, watched some tutorials, and hashed out some strategies. Here’s what I learned.Redux is easier than we thinkRedux has this sort of mist around it, as if it’s some sort of black magic library that only a subset of people in the frontend web development industry actually understand. I think we need to get rid of this assumption — since Redux is just a tool for lifting our data state to another layer in our application — away from our components.ConceptsRedux have some concepts with naming that can be quite deceiving and sound more complicated than they actually are. These are the main concepts in Redux.StoreThe store is where all data is eventually going to be stored.const store = createStore(reducers)ReducerThe reducer is kind of the exchange point for the incoming actions.switch (action.type) {  case 'GET_TODOS':    ...  case 'CREATE_TODO:    ...  CASE 'PATCH_TODO':    ...  case 'DELETE_TODO':    ...}ActionActions are the triggers for fetching, patching, deleting and adding to state.function createTodo(todo) {  return {    type: 'CREATE_TODO',    payload: todo  }}Full exampleLet’s try a real example. I’m not going to build a simple counter app like every other Redux tutorial does, since it’s not very real case. Let’s build a todo app that actually updates data in a database, and uses Redux for its frontend data layer management. Let’s start by creating a new React app and installing some dependencies.Create projectyarn create react-app todo-frontendInstall dependenciesredux: Redux is the main library for creating our store.react-redux: Makes it easier to dispatch our actions and getting state.redux-thunk: A middleware that allows us to make async actions.yarn add redux react-redux redux-thunkThis project is going to use Javascript instead of Typescript. You can certainly use Typescript, and in fact, that’s what I’m doing at my project at work, but it does complicate things a little bit more, and it’s probably not useful for this tutorial anyways.Create reducerLet’s create our Todo reducer that is going to act as the exchange point for our action dispatching. We’re going to need a couple of actions but it’s not very difficult. You can more or less put this file wherever you are. A reducer is no special code, it’s just a regular Javascript function with a switch statement inside of it, that returns the next state.const initialState = {  data: [],  getLoading: false,  getError: """",createResponse: null,  createLoading: false,  createError: """",patchResponse: null,  patchLoading: false,  patchError: """",deleteResponse: null,  deleteLoading: false,  deleteError: """",};function todoReducer(state = initialState, action) {  switch (action.type) {    case ""GET_TODOS"":      return {        ...state,        getLoading: true,        getError: """",      };    case ""GET_TODOS_SUCCESS"":      return {        ...state,        data: action.payload,        getLoading: false,      };    case ""GET_TODOS_ERROR"":      return {        ...state,        getLoading: false,        getError: action.payload,      };    case ""CREATE_TODO"":      return {        ...state,        createLoading: true,        createError: """",      };    case ""CREATE_TODO_SUCCESS"":      return {        ...state,        data: [...state.data, action.payload],        createResponse: action.payload,        createLoading: false,      };    case ""CREATE_TODO_ERROR"":      return {        ...state,        createLoading: false,        createError: action.payload,      };    case ""PATCH_TODO"":      return {        ...state,        patchLoading: true,        patchError: """",      };    case ""PATCH_TODO_SUCCESS"":      return {        ...state,        data: state.payload.map((todo) => {          return todo.id === action.payload ? action.payload : todo;        }),        patchResponse: action.payload,        patchLoading: false,      };    case ""PATCH_TODO_ERROR"":      return {        ...state,        patchLoading: false,        patchError: action.payload,      };    case ""DELETE_TODO"":      return {        ...state,        patchLoading: true,        patchError: """",      };    case ""DELETE_TODO_SUCCESS"":      return {        ...state,        data: state.data.filter((todo) => todo.id !== action.payload),        patchResponse: action.payload,        patchLoading: false,      };    case ""DELETE_TODO_ERROR"":      return {        ...state,        patchLoading: false,        patchError: action.payload,      };    default:      return state;  }}export default todoReducer;Combine reducersIn a big project we would most likely have more than one reducer. You usually tend to have 1 reducer for each entity. For example, if you have a project containing todos, events, and friends. You would probably want to have a matching reducer for each of them. Anyways, let’s use the function for combining multiple reducers before creating our store, just to show how this would look in a larger project.import { combineReducers } from ""redux"";import todoReducer from ""./todo"";const rootReducer = combineReducers({  todo: todoReducer,});export default rootReducer;Create storeNow that we have created our reducer and combined it to create root reducer, we are ready to create our store. Let’s create a new file and create our store.import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from ""redux"";import rootReducer from ""./reducers"";import thunk from ""thunk""const store = createStore(rootReducer, applyMiddleware(thunk));export default store;Now you have created your store. Although we’re going to add another thing, called Redux devtools. This is a really helpful Chrome extension that lets you see exactly what your store looks like at any moment, as well as what actions are being triggered in real time. To install this we just need to update our store creation like the following.zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extensionNote that starting from v2.7, window.devToolsExtension was renamed to window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__ /…github.comimport { applyMiddleware, compose, createStore } from ""redux"";import thunk from ""redux-thunk"";import rootReducer from ""./reducers"";const store = createStore(  rootReducer,  compose(    applyMiddleware(thunk),    window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__ && window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__()  ));export default store;Wrap your appNow, let’s wrap our app using the provider component from react-redux, to make sure data will be accessible anywhere inside of our application.import React from ""react"";import ReactDOM from ""react-dom"";import App from ""./App"";import { Provider } from ""react-redux"";import store from ""./store"";ReactDOM.render(  <React.StrictMode>    <Provider store={store}>      <App />    </Provider>  </React.StrictMode>,  document.getElementById(""root""));Write actionsThe last thing we can do before we jump over to our React components is to write the actions we are going to call when we want to update the state. Let’s create a new file for doing this.export function getTodos() {  return async (dispatch) => {    dispatch({      type: ""GET_TODOS"",    });    try {      const todos = await api.getTodos();      dispatch({        type: ""GET_TODOS_SUCCESS"",        payload: todos,      });    } catch (err) {      dispatch({        type: ""GET_TODOS_SUCCESS"",        payload: err.message || ""Failed to get todos!"",      });    }  };}export function createTodo(title) {  return async (dispatch) => {    dispatch({      type: ""CREATE_TODO"",    });    try {      const todo = await api.createTodo(title);      dispatch({        type: ""CREATE_TODO_SUCCESS"",        payload: todo,      });    } catch (err) {      dispatch({        type: ""CREATE_TODO_SUCCESS"",        payload: err.message || ""Failed to create todo!"",      });    }  };}export function patchTodo(id, title) {  return async (dispatch) => {    dispatch({      type: ""PATCH_TODO"",    });    try {      const newTodo = api.patchTodo(id, title);      dispatch({        type: ""PATCH_TODO_SUCCESS"",        payload: newTodo,      });    } catch (err) {      dispatch({        type: ""PATCH_TODO_SUCCESS"",        payload: err.message || ""Failed to patch todo!"",      });    }  };}export function deleteTodo(id) {  return async (dispatch) => {    dispatch({      type: ""DELETE_TODO"",    });    try {      await api.deleteTodo(id);      dispatch({        type: ""DELETE_TODO_SUCCESS"",        payload: id,      });    } catch (err) {      dispatch({        type: ""DELETE_TODO_SUCCESS"",        payload: err.message || ""Failed to delete todo!"",      });    }  };}React componentNow we have finally set up our reducers, actions and our store. Now we can start creating our React component that’s actually going to let the users create, patch, and delete their todos. We are going to use 2 hooks here. The useDispatch and the useSelector. The latter is going to enable us to pick and choose what data we want from our store. And the first one is going to let us dispatch our actions, and therefor connect them to redux, since they’re currently just regular Javascript functions.import React from ""react"";import { useDispatch, useSelector } from ""react-redux"";import { createTodo, deleteTodo, patchTodo } from ""./store/actions/todo"";function App() {  const dispatch = useDispatch();  const { data: todos } = useSelector((state) => state.todo);  useEffect(() => {    dispatch(getTodos())  }, [dispatch])  return (    <div>      <button        onClick={() =>          dispatch(createTodo(`Buy oat milk (todo ${todos.length + 1})`))        }      >        Create todo      </button>      <ul>        {todos.map((todo) => (          <li key={todo.id}>            <span>{todo.title}</span>            <button              style={{ marginLeft: ""1rem"" }}              onClick={() =>                dispatch(patchTodo(todo.id, `${todo.title}(edited)`))              }            >              Edit todo            </button>            <button              style={{ marginLeft: ""1rem"" }}              onClick={() => dispatch(deleteTodo(todo.id))}            >              Delete todo            </button>          </li>        ))}      </ul>    </div>  );}export default App;Now your page should list out every todo from whatever backend and database you are using. By updating and deleting todos we’re going to update our global redux state and therefor get new data through our select hook. If we want to see what’s actually happening, we can open up the Chrome Redux devtools. Here you can see every action happening in real time.SuccessNow we have built a fully functional React app that uses Redux to globally store, create, and update data. We have also, in the meantime, moved the data layer to another place in our app. Instead of setting and updating state in our React components, we do this in the actions and reducers which makes our components a lot cleaner and easier to update in the future.JavaScript In Plain EnglishNew JavaScript + Web Development articles every day.Follow100 ReduxRedux ThunkReactJavaScriptWeb Development100 claps100 clapsWritten byAlbin GroenFollowHi!

How Simple to Create Ecommerce Store with Reactjs,https://medium.com/@ivy555/learn-stepwise-to-create-e-commerce-website-in-react-with-redux-dca78932a761?source=tag_archive---------12-----------------------,"Ecommerce,React,React Native,Website,Web Development","Lean step-by-step how to create a full e-commerce store web site using React.js.Final outlookThis course let you gets your hand dirty by creating a simple shopping cart with React components. Soon you will find out how hard it is to manage states between nested React components. Here is where Redux comes into picture and let you move data and UI states to Redux store from react components. You will be able to do all the boilerplates to change a React Application to React & Redux application and implement different actions like fetching product from Restful API, adding items to cart, removing items from cart and etc with Redux.What you’ll learnMaking Ecommerce websiteDeveloping with ReactjsUnderstanding Redux in actionPhoto by Sapan Patel on UnsplashI use Visual Studio Code for most of my React JS project and I highly recommend you to use.Now, create a new folder, name it whatever you want.Open vscode.Press ctrl-shift-n (cmd-shift-n) to open a new vscode window.in the new window, click the “Open Folder” blue button on the Explorer pane,Browse and select the folder you created.Go to View → Terminal to open a terminal inside vscode.Getting Started with ReduxRedux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.You can use Redux together with React, or with any other view library. It is tiny (2kB, including dependencies), but has a large ecosystem of addons available.Create React AppCreate React App is a comfortable environment for learning React, and is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React.It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production. You’ll need to have Node >= 8.10 and npm >= 5.6 on your machine. To create a project, run:npx create-react-app shopping-reactappcd shopping-reactappnpm startNotenpx on the first line is not a typo — it’s a package runner tool that comes with npm 5.2+.Create React App doesn’t handle backend logic or databases; it just creates a frontend build pipeline, so you can use it with any backend you want. Under the hood, it uses Babel and webpack, but you don’t need to know anything about them.When you’re ready to deploy to production, running npm run build will create an optimized build of your app in the build folder. You can learn more about Create React App from its README and the User Guide.Start from here =>Photo by Emma Frances Logan on UnsplashCreate a React Redux AppThe recommended way to start new apps with React and Redux is by using the official Redux+JS template for Create React App, which takes advantage of Redux Toolkit and React Redux’s integration with React components.npx create-react-app shopping-reactapp --template redux#Redux CoreThe Redux core library is available as a package on NPM for use with a module bundler or in a Node application:Copy# NPMnpm install redux# Yarnyarn add reduxNote : — It will take some time to install all the packages so keep patience :)2nd Step =>Create the below components as javascript files in the “ components for UI” ,services for state management and static for images” folder.Now your project directory should look like this.3rd step =>Create the below folder as in the “ components folder4th step =>Create following javascript file index.js in every folder inside the listed components folderfor example =>app=> index.jsThe directry will be like this as show below5th step =>add products images in the folders products inside the static folder for smaller image for cart items when it gets added to the cart and larger image for product list.e.g.static=> products =>image number_1.jpgimage number_2.jpg6th step =>always import by shortcut key “imrc” which creates components easilyfor exampleInside the Header folder in components =>Header=> index.jsimport React, { Component } from 'react';import './index.css';export default class index extends Component {render() {return (<nav className=""navigation""><h2>SBAY</h2></nav>)}}add styles for css =>Header => index.css.navigation{background-color:black;color:darkred;height:60px;width:100%;margin-top: -60px;/* background-image: url(""https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/img_lights.jpg"");

Basic Routing in JavaScript,https://medium.com/swlh/basic-routing-in-javascript-fb3e51a3a57b?source=tag_archive---------13-----------------------,"Coding,JavaScript,Programming,Web Development,Software Engineering","Routing Using Express and EJSWhile working on my latest single page JavaScript application this week, I ran in to the need for a way to handle client-side routing. While there are many routing frameworks that exist for this purpose, I decided on using Express server since I had some familiarity with it and because of the extensive documentation available for it.Routing refers to the way in which client requests to particular endpoints are handled in an application. It’s how we are able to go from one view on a website to another, depending on what URL we type in to the browser. The route definition is comprised of a path and a HTTP request method and takes the following basic structure:app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)where the handler is the function that gets executed when there is a route match.If we wanted to define a home route for our app at the path of ‘/’, we could write a simple route such as the one below:app.get('/', (req, res) => {  res.send('Hello World!')}); Before we go any further, let’s take a step back and look into what Express is and how to set it up.Express ServerSo what exactly is Express? Express is a web application framework for Node.js that allows us to structure and organize our web applications easily and efficiently. In order to install Express globally, we run the following command: npm install express — save .Within our project, we would then create a server.js file, wherein which we initialize the Express server and configure our routes. A basic example of this is:const express = require('express');const app = express();app.get('/', (req, res) => {  res.send('Home Page')});app.get('/log', (req, res) => {  res.send('Log Page')})app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server Started'))The above code sets up and initializes the Express server and defines two routes: the home page at ‘/’ and a log page at ‘/log’. We can then spin up our server by running node server.js . If we then go to localhost:3000, we should be taken to the home page (which at the moment just displays “Home Page”). If we go to localhost:3000/log, we should see “Log Page”.Using EJS for TemplatingNext, we’ll want to set up a template engine to use with Express, which allows us to use static template files in our application. When the application is run, the template engine then transforms the template into an HTML file, which is what the client sees on their screen. There are various template engines compatible with Express, and for this project, I’ve chosen to use EJS. EJS lets us generate HTML markup using vanilla JavaScript.To install EJS, run npm install ejs — save . We will then have to set our view engine to EJS in our server.js file:app.set('view engine', 'ejs');To make sure our template files render correctly, we’ll then need to create a views directory within our project — this is where we’ll hold our template files.For styling, we’ll want to create a public folder in our root directory and then place our stylesheet(s) in that folder. Don’t forget to link the stylesheet to your EJS template by placing the link element in the head.To render our views with the HTML markup, we can use the render method in our controller action. Within our server.js file, we would replace the code we had written with the following:app.get('/', (req, res) => {   res.render('home')});This tells our application to render the ‘home’ template when it receives a GET request to ‘/’.Wrapping UpAnd that’s it!Here is how my server.js file looks like:const express = require('express');const app = express();// sets the view engine to EJSapp.set('view engine', 'ejs');// directs Express to the public folder for stylesheetsapp.use(express.static(""public""));// controller actionsapp.get('/', (req, res) => {   res.render('home')});app.get('/log', (req, res) => {   res.render('log')})app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server Started'))The StartupMedium's largest active publication, followed by +723K people.

Service Workers — 1 (PWA Nedir),https://medium.com/frontend-development-with-js/service-workers-1-pwa-nedir-35e4f99c7bbf?source=tag_archive---------14-----------------------,"Pwa,Web Development,Service Worker,Progressive Web App,Front End Development","Bu yazı daha önceden başlamış olduğum Web API yazı serisinin devamı niteliğindedir. Web App (Web Uygulamaları) son dönemde masa üstü içi geliştirilen uygulamaların bir çoğu tarayıcı ortamına taşınarak buradan erişebilir hale getirilmeye başlamıştır.Bunun yanında mobilin gelişmesi ile bir çok uygulamada Native uygulama olarak geliştirildi. Native uygulamalar 2 türde geliştirilebilir Apple ve Android önerdiği araçlar ve diller ile Apple için XCode → ObjectiveC/Swift , Andoid için AndroidStudio → Java/Kotlin, kullanmalısınız.Eğerki ben her platforma native geliştirme yapmak için yeni dil ve araç öğrenmek istemiyorum diyorsanız.Bunun içinde alternatif araçlar bulunuyor. Xamarin, Flutter, Electron, React Native, Ionic tüm bu platformlar için Android, iPhone, MacOS, Windows için Native kodlar üretebiliyor.Temelde 2 tip uygulama söz konusuNative/Hibrid UygulamalarWeb UygulamalarNative uygulamalar AppStore’dan indirilen ve platform kaynaklarına daha iyi şekilde erişebilen uygulamalar. Örneğin kamera, sensörler, network, cpu, disk , dosya sistemi erişebilir ve daha performanslı çalışır.Web uygulamaları ise çalışmak için bir tarayıcıya ihtiyaç duyar. Chrome, Safari, Edge, Firefox veya Opera gibi browser üzerinden çalıştırılan uygulamalardır.Web uygulamaların 2 türü var diyebiliriz.İçerdeki verinin public olmadığı sadece ilgili müşteri girdiğinde görebildiği verileri gördüğü uygulamalar.İçerdeki verinin public olduğu E-Ticaret, Gazete, Blog, Portal türündeki uygulamalar.Progressive → ilerici anlamında kullanılır. Burada Web Uygulamalarını daha ileriye taşıyan teknoloji anlamına geliyor. Web uygulamaların Native uygulamalara göre (app store ihtiyaç duymaması, güncelleme kolaylığı, arama motorları tarafından kolay indekslenme) avantajları olsada (kullanıcı alışkanlıkları, performans, cihaz özelliklerini desteklememe, tarayıcı gibi bir aracı kullanma gibi) dezavantajlarıda içerir.Web uygulamalarını bir adım ileriye taşımak için bir takım teknik yeteneklerle Native Uygulamaya yaklaştırmaya çalışmışlar. Bunun adına PWA yani Progressive Web App demişler. Bu özellikleri ve desteklediği ortamları listelersek;Kurulabilir (Installable) Olması: Native uygulamalar AppStore veya başka adreslerden indirerek kurabilirsiniz. Kurduğunuzda ana ekrandan bir ikon sayesinde hızlı bir şekilde uygulamayı çalıştırabilirsiniz.Offline Çalışabilmeyi Desteklemesi: İnternet olmadığı durumlarda uygulamanın belli ölçüde çalışabilir olması, internetin tekrar bağlandığında kullanıcı girdilerini sync sisteme aktabilmesi.Responsive Olması: Ekranların Desktop, iPad, Mobile cihazlarda sorunsuz şekilde çalışması, layout buna göre güncellemesi.Hızlı ve Perfomanslı Çalışması: Uygulama ekranının hızlı açılması ve sonradan da hızlı çalışması. Bunun için sadece gerekli JS, CSS ve verilerin download edilmesi veya download edilen verilerin tekrar tekrar çekilmemesi.Daha başka ek özelliklerde sayabiliriz tamamiyle erişebilir(accessible), aramalarda sayfaya erişebilen (search), he türlü girdi cihazı ile çalışabilen (input types), bildirim, geolokasyon ve diğer yetkiler için izin talebi(permission request) vb.Kısaca Teknik1. İleri Düzey Kullanıcı Deneyimi ve Offline ÇalışmaService Worker’lar arkaplanda veri sync yaparak kullanıcıya daha akıcı bir şekilde verinin görüntülenmesine, internetin olmadığı durumları algılayıp kullanıcı isteklerini cache üzerinden karşılamaya çalışır. Ayrıca veriler local ortamda mevcut ise tekrar tekrar yükleme ihtiyacı duymaz.2. Web Push Notifications (Web Bildirimleri)Service Worker’lar arkaplanda PushAPI bildirimlerini alarak bunu NotificationAPI üzerinden kullanıcıyı bilgilendirmek için kullanırlar.3. Home screen & SplashscreenJSON Manifest dosyası içerisinde uygulama ismi, iconu vb bilgileri barındırarak, kullanıcı webapp masa üstüne kaydetmesine olanak sağlar.4. Geolocation, Video/Image Capturing, BluetoothKullanıcı izni alınarak mobil cihazların lokasyon bilgisini alabilmek için Geolocation API , resim ve videolara erişmek için Media Capture API, Bluetooth erişebilmek için Bluetooth API faydalanılabilir.Bu yazıda PWA’dan kısaca bahsettik, Service Worker’ın bu özelliklerin kullanılabilmesi için temel teşkil eder. Bir sonraki yazımda Service Worker anlatabiliriz artık :)ReferanslarPWA ChecklistPWA Pros/ConsPWA Browser SupportUzun süredir farklı sektörlerde (Askeri, Telekomünikasyon, Devlet, Bankacılık, Sigortacılık, Tübitak, SaaS) yazılımlar geliştiriyorum.

JavaScript Best Practices — DOM Performance,https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/javascript-best-practices-dom-performance-664024e247de?source=tag_archive---------15-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Mazlin Massey on UnsplashLike any kind of apps, JavaScript apps also have to be written well.Otherwise, we run into all kinds of issues later on.In this article, we’ll look at some best practices we should follow when writing JavaScript code.Too Many Interactions with the HostWe shouldn't interact too much with any DOM objects.They render slowly and we should reduce the number of interactions that are done.Too Many DependenciesIf we have too many dependencies, then we should reduce them.Over the years, many things are added to the JavaScript standard library.So we don’t have to use 3rd party dependencies to do the same thing.For instance, Lodash array methods can be replaced with built-in array methods.3rd party HTTP clients can be replaced with the Fetch API.Poor Event HandlingTo improve performance of event handling, we should use them properly.We should remove unnecessary loops and unbind unused event handlers with jQuery unbind or plain JavaScript’s removeEventListener to remove them.Unorganized CodeTo make our lives easier, we should organize our code into coherent chunks.This way, we can find the code later.Use HTTP/2HTTP/2 is the latest version of JavaScript and provides many enhancements over the original version.We’ll see speed improvements if we switch to HTTP/2 server for hosting our site.Use Pointer ReferencesWe should catch our DOM objects in a variable so that we don’t have to get them again from the DOM if we need it later.We just take the variable and use that.For instance, we can write:const fooEl = document.querySelector('.foo');to get the element with the class foo .Trim our HTMLWe can reduce the number of items that needed to be loaded by reducing the elements on our page.The fewer we have, the less we need to load, and the faster our page will be.Use document.getElementById()We can use getElementById .Getting things by ID is faster since there’s only one element with a given ID on a page.This means our browser doesn’t have to check all the nodes to find all the items.For example, we can write:const button = document.getElementById('window-minimize-button');Use document.querySelector()If we only want to get one element with the given selector, we can use querySelector to get the DOM node with the given selector.The browser stops looking after the first node with the given selector is found, which makes the lookup faster.For example, we can write:const button = document.querySelector('#window-minimize-button');Batch our DOM ChangesWe should batch our DOM changes so that we won’t rerender multiple times.This way, our web page would feel faster for the user.Buffer our DOMIf we have scrollable divs, we can use a buffer to remove items from the DOM that aren’t currently visible in the viewport.This will save memory usage and DOM traversal.There are many libraries to help us with this like React Virtualized for React apps.Photo by Kayla Farmer on UnsplashConclusionWe can apply various techniques to speed up DOM manipulation.These can make a big difference in performance.JavaScript In Plain EnglishEnjoyed this article?

How I organize CSS for React.js,https://medium.com/dev-genius/how-i-organize-css-for-react-js-7c9c212c1719?source=tag_archive---------16-----------------------,"CSS,React,Software Development,Web Development,Organization","Is your CSS for your React project jumbled into one index.css file with no structure? Do you have a bunch of old CSS modifiers and aren’t sure if they’re being used?In other words, is your CSS a mess and you need a way of organizing CSS for React? Look no further! Here is my system for organizing React CSS.I’m not really an expert, but after watching some Youtube videos of other experienced React developers and reading up on BEM, these are a few tips I’ve picked up.Always use classNamesFirstly, use classNames to modify ALL your components instead of ids because of the nature of React.For some time, I was using both ids and classNames because I knew some components I would only use once and others I would use multiple times. While this logic makes sense when writing normal HTML elements, React is all about creating reusable components. Therefore, it makes sense with React to ALWAYS use classNames in your component definition whether or not they will be used once or twice.Honestly, it doesn’t really matter too much whether or not you use id’s or classNames, but personally, I think using classNames makes more sense with what React components are. Also, it looks a lot cleaner because of the consistency.BEMBEM (Block, Element, Modifier) is a popular naming convention for CSS modifiers. It gives your elements’ className context and association.Check out my old component without BEM.And with BEM.Isn’t it easier to understand what an element is just by its className? This will be more apparent when working with CSS.What is BEM?The way BEM classifies CSS is a Block and its Elements (also Modifiers, but I’ll just talk about Blocks and Elements). Read more about BEM.The block is a component at some level of abstraction, and its elements are smaller parts that make up the block. For example, if you have a bunch of baseball cards, one way you can look at it is each baseball card is a block. Elements within that block would be the player’s name, his stats, etc…In CSS it looks like this: (Elements are defined with syntax: blockName__element.)If you created a React component for a PlayerCard ‘block’.Note***: Make your classNames consistent and predictable by making the className for the outer div in any component the same name as the component name!! Having predictable and consistent naming makes it easier to find and work with CSS.For nested components, just use the name of the top-level block. You don’t need to specify each element it’s nested inside.So for the Hand example:Separate CSS filesOne last thing, create a separate CSS file for each React component.Keeping separate CSS will make it much easier to find the CSS you’re looking for.It’s also easier to keep smaller CSS files organized and current.Quicker to navigate to CSS file because Name.css will be right next to Name.js. This is better than trying to find index.css each time you want to modify a component.It may seem like a bunch of work, creating and importing separate CSS files for each component, esp. when you have a lot of components, but it makes working with CSS a LOT easier.For me, adding to a big project is much easier when my code is organized and structured, and these three tips have helped me keep my CSS clean and manageable.Thanks for reading, I hope you found this article helpful! :)Dev GeniusCoding, Tutorials, News, UX, UI and much more related to developmentFollow21 Sign up for Best StoriesBy Dev GeniusThe best stories sent monthly to your email. Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

React Best Practices —Small Components,https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/react-best-practices-small-components-f998a8e8ab7e?source=tag_archive---------17-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Davies Designs Studio on UnsplashLike any kind of apps, JavaScript apps also have to be written well.Otherwise, we run into all kinds of issues later on.In this article, we’ll look at some best practices we should follow when writing React apps.Keep Components Small and SpecificComponents should only do one thing.This way, we can test and maintain them easier.Each small component can be reused across projects.The components can be made available to the community.We can implement performance optimizations on smaller components more easily,Bigger components have to do more and it’s harder to maintain.ReusabilityWe should create components that are reusable so that we don’t have to add new ones all the time.They can be used across any number of projects.If a component becomes big, we can break them up to smaller components.For instance, we can write:const Button = ({ iconClass, onClick }) => {  return (    <button onClick={onClick()}>      <i class={iconClass} />    </button>  );};to make a reusable button.It takes the iconClass and onClick props so that we can pass click handlers and icon class to them.If we have duplicate code, we should consolidate them into one.This way, we can just use one icon to do everything.Put CSS in JavaScriptWe can put CSS into our JavaScript code.If a project is created with Create React App, we can import CSS files as modules.This is because Webpack has the CSS loader added to it to let us do that.So we can just write:import ""./styles.css"";to import the styles.We can also add libraries like EmotionJS into our project.It can generate CSS files for production by importing the library.We can install it by running:npm install --save emotionThen we can write:import React from ""react"";import { css } from ""emotion"";const color = ""white"";const Div = props => {  return (    <div      className={css`        padding: 32px;        background-color: yellow;        font-size: 24px;        border-radius: 4px;        &:hover {          color: ${color};        }      `}    >      Hover to change color.    </div>  );};to add our CSS code.It’s more convenient than just writing out code in CSS files since we can dynamically change the styles.We did that with the color .The css tag transforms the style string into an object.There’re other libraries like styled-jsx and styled-components that let us do the same thing.Comment Only Where NecessaryWe should comment only where necessary.We don’t need to clutter up our code with the comments that repeat what’s in the code.Also, we don’t want to create discrepancies between the code and the comments.Comments can easily become outdated.Name the Component After the FunctionNaming components after the functionality that has makes finding them easier later.We can find where the component is and know what it does much easier.We can name a component like AuthorAvatar so that we know the avatar is for authors.Naming a function for the functionality also makes it more likely to be discovered.DPhoto by Brian Holdsworth on UnsplashConclusionWe should make functions small and reusable. And we should name them for their functionality so that we can find them.JavaScript In Plain EnglishEnjoyed this article?

Angular With Ag-Grid Quick Start,https://medium.com/swlh/angular-with-ag-grid-quick-start-dfda8f02d9a?source=tag_archive---------18-----------------------,"Angular,Web Development,Programming,Angular 10,Coding","Angular InstallationPrerequisitesAngular projects are dependent on npm packages. So by installing Node.js, we by default get npm package manager, which is used to install npm packages.Download Node.js using this link → https://nodejs.org/en/download/Once the installation done, we get node and npm binaries added to systems environment path. That means, now you can use node and npm command.Lets check the version of Node installed by using the following commands in our terminal:Command Prompt — Node and NPM VersionsInstalling Angular CLINow, Lets Install Angular!!. Enter the following command in the terminal:npm install -g @angular/cliWe can check the version of Angular installed.ng versionCreate Your Angular Projectng new my-sample --style scss --routing falseIn the above command we are passing --style scss, so that we can customize our project using Sass and --routing false , as we will not be implementing routing.Output from Command Prompt — After running the above commandMake your way into the project that has been created via the following command:cd my-sampleNow let us start our angular project using ng-serve.ng serveOutput from Command Prompt — After running ‘ng serve’ commandWe can view our app from our browser by going to this URL: http://localhost:4200/If everything goes as expected, then Congratulations !!!.. Yeeee..Angular App — Browser at FirstLets stop the command prompt by pressing “Ctrl + c” and add the Ag-Grid NPM packages to our project.npm install --save ag-grid-community ag-grid-angularnpm installNow that the Ag-Grid packages are added and a great deal of time has passed since. Lets get to the code !!!!. We have to add the Ag-Grid styles to the styles.scss (my-sample\src\styles.scss).@import ""../node_modules/ag-grid-community/src/styles/ag-grid.scss"";@import ""../node_modules/ag-grid-community/src/styles/ag-theme-alpine/sass/ag-theme-alpine-mixin.scss"";.ag-theme-alpine {    @include ag-theme-alpine();}The next step is to add the Ag-Grid Angular module to the root AppModule file by importing it and add AgGridModule to the imports array (my-sample\src\app\app.module.ts):Next, we have to declare the grid (my-sample\src\app\app.component.ts):In the code above we have used column definitions (columnDefs) and the Row data (rowData). Here in our example we have three columns where each of them contain two properties ‘headerName’ which contains Header Name and ‘fields’ which contains the data field to be displayed in the body of the table.Please Note: The value in ‘columndef (key,value)’ must match with the key of ‘rowData (key,value)’.Now lets add the HTML component to our code (my-sample\src\app\app.component.html).If everything goes as expected, then Congratulations Once Again!. Yeeeah!!!...Get/Fetch Data from a ServerNow that we have successfully displayed hard coded data, lets try getting our data from a server or in this case github where i have a JSON file.Github URL for the json file: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/monishnarendra/Angular-Ag-Grid-Quick-Start-Example/master/Data.jsonEnable HTTP ServicesLet’s add HttpClient to the root AppModule file by importing it and add HttpClientModule to the imports array (my-sample\src\app\app.module.ts) which is used for communicating with a server.Now we need to remove the hard-coded data and fetch it from a server by making changes to the app.component file (my-sample\src\app\app.component.ts):Injecting HttpClient into the constructor in a private property called http. Through http we can used the get method to communicate to the server and the subscribe function receives the data (json) from the server and pushes it into to the ‘rowData’ list for display.Notice that we also imported the OnInit and implemented it in our export class. This is done so that we can use the ngOnInit function. As the ngOnInit is called by Angular to indicate that the Angular is done creating the component. Hence we want our data to be loaded as soon as Angular is done creating its components.Browser After Fetching Data from serverCheckbox, Filtering and SortingSince we are done with fetching the data, let me show you how simple it is to implement sorting and filtering in the data using ag-grid.All we need to do is to add the properties ( sortable, filter and checkboxSelection) and set them to true. Yes its that easy, Don’t believe me.. hmm Let me show you.If everything works out well then you should be seeing this:Browser After implementing Checkbox, Filter and SortGetting Selected row from Ag-gridThis task is fairly simple too, lets first create the instance of the component.Now lets try accessing this (‘#myGrid’) instance from our component.Next we need to add a button that triggers/calls a function which gets the selected data and prints the selected row in the browser console.ConclusionI do hope this “Quick Start” guide has shown you how easy it is to integrate and configure Ag-Grid with Angular.Whole solution at this GitHub Repository. Your probably now thinking “I could’ve avoided all that copy/pasting.!!!!” But hey, hope you learned something along the way. I know I did.Comments and questions welcome below — I hope that you found this useful!Happy Coding!!!The StartupMedium's largest active publication, followed by +723K people.

React Bootstrap — Input Group Addons,https://medium.com/dev-genius/react-bootstrap-input-group-addons-e42f38884f03?source=tag_archive---------20-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Martin Moreno on UnsplashReact Bootstrap is one version of Bootstrap made for React.It’s a set of React components that have Bootstrap styles.In this article, we’ll look at how to add input groups to a React app with React Bootstrap.Input Group Checkboxes and RadiosWe can add checkboxes and radio buttons to input groups.To do this, we can use the InputGrou.Checkbox and InputGroup.Radio components respectively.For instance, we can write:import React from ""react"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";import InputGroup from ""react-bootstrap/InputGroup"";import FormControl from ""react-bootstrap/FormControl"";export default function App() {  return (    <div>      <InputGroup className=""mb-3"">        <InputGroup.Prepend>          <InputGroup.Checkbox/>        </InputGroup.Prepend>        <FormControl />      </InputGroup>      <InputGroup>        <InputGroup.Prepend>          <InputGroup.Radio />        </InputGroup.Prepend>        <FormControl />      </InputGroup>    </div>  );}We just add them inside the InputGroup.Prepend component to add them to the left of the input box.Multiple InputsWe can have multiple controls in one input group.We just add them all into the InputGroup .For example, we can write:import React from ""react"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";import InputGroup from ""react-bootstrap/InputGroup"";import FormControl from ""react-bootstrap/FormControl"";export default function App() {  return (    <div>      <InputGroup className=""mb-3"">        <InputGroup.Prepend>          <InputGroup.Text>name and age</InputGroup.Text>        </InputGroup.Prepend>        <FormControl />        <FormControl />      </InputGroup>    </div>  );}Multiple AddonsAlso, we can have multiple input group addons on either side of the input box.For example, we can write:import React from ""react"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";import InputGroup from ""react-bootstrap/InputGroup"";import FormControl from ""react-bootstrap/FormControl"";export default function App() {  return (    <div>      <InputGroup className=""mb-3"">        <InputGroup.Prepend>          <InputGroup.Text>$</InputGroup.Text>          <InputGroup.Text>US</InputGroup.Text>          <InputGroup.Text>0.00</InputGroup.Text>        </InputGroup.Prepend>        <FormControl placeholder=""amount"" />      </InputGroup>      <InputGroup className=""mb-3"">        <FormControl placeholder=""amount"" />        <InputGroup.Append>          <InputGroup.Text>$</InputGroup.Text>          <InputGroup.Text>US</InputGroup.Text>          <InputGroup.Text>0.00</InputGroup.Text>        </InputGroup.Append>      </InputGroup>    </div>  );}to add 3 addons on the left side of the first input group.We add 3 addons to the right side of the second input group.Button AddonsWe can have buttons as add-ons.For example, we can write:import React from ""react"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";import InputGroup from ""react-bootstrap/InputGroup"";import FormControl from ""react-bootstrap/FormControl"";import Button from ""react-bootstrap/Button"";export default function App() {  return (    <div>      <InputGroup className=""mb-3"">        <InputGroup.Prepend>          <Button variant=""outline-primary"">click me</Button>        </InputGroup.Prepend>        <FormControl />      </InputGroup>      <InputGroup className=""mb-3"">        <FormControl placeholder=""username"" />        <InputGroup.Append>          <Button variant=""outline-primary"">click me</Button>        </InputGroup.Append>      </InputGroup>      <InputGroup className=""mb-3"">        <InputGroup.Prepend>          <Button variant=""outline-primary"">click me</Button>          <Button variant=""outline-primary"">click me</Button>        </InputGroup.Prepend>        <FormControl />      </InputGroup>      <InputGroup>        <FormControl placeholder=""username"" />        <InputGroup.Append>          <Button variant=""outline-primary"">click me</Button>          <Button variant=""outline-primary"">click me</Button>        </InputGroup.Append>      </InputGroup>    </div>  );}We have buttons inside the InputGroup.Prepend and InputGroup.Append components to add them to the left and right of the input box respectively.Buttons with DropdownsWe can also add buttons with dropdowns as input addons.For example, we can write:import React from ""react"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";import InputGroup from ""react-bootstrap/InputGroup"";import FormControl from ""react-bootstrap/FormControl"";import Dropdown from ""react-bootstrap/Dropdown"";import DropdownButton from ""react-bootstrap/DropdownButton"";export default function App() {  return (    <div>      <InputGroup className=""mb-3"">        <DropdownButton          as={InputGroup.Prepend}          variant=""outline-primary""          title=""Dropdown""        >          <Dropdown.Item href=""#"">foo</Dropdown.Item>          <Dropdown.Item href=""#"">bar</Dropdown.Item>          <Dropdown.Divider />          <Dropdown.Item href=""#"">baz</Dropdown.Item>        </DropdownButton>        <FormControl />      </InputGroup>      <InputGroup>        <FormControl placeholder=""username"" />        <DropdownButton          as={InputGroup.Prepend}          variant=""outline-primary""          title=""Dropdown""        >          <Dropdown.Item href=""#"">foo</Dropdown.Item>          <Dropdown.Item href=""#"">bar</Dropdown.Item>          <Dropdown.Divider />          <Dropdown.Item href=""#"">baz</Dropdown.Item>        </DropdownButton>      </InputGroup>    </div>  );}We use the DropdownButton with the as prop set to InmputGeoup.Prepend so that it’ll fit into the input group.Also, we set the variant to change the style of the button.Photo by Behzad Ghaffarian on UnsplashConclusionWe can add dropdowns and buttons to input groups.Also, we can have more than one input group addons in one group.Dev GeniusCoding, Tutorials,

Node.js Best Practices — Production Environment,https://medium.com/dev-genius/node-js-best-practices-production-environment-b0c38065c783?source=tag_archive---------21-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Caleb Woods on UnsplashLike any kind of apps, JavaScript apps also have to be written well.Otherwise, we run into all kinds of issues later on.In this article, we’ll look at some best practices we should follow when writing Node apps.Get Frontend Assets Out of NodeOur node app shouldn’t server front end assets.Instead, we can use dedicated middleware to do this.Node performance isn’t good when dealing with many static files since it’s single-threaded.Be StatelessOur app should be stateless.This means that we should store any state in our app in external data stores.We can kill our servers periodically or use serverless platforms like AWS Lambda that enforces stateless behavior.This way, we can kill our server without having any downtime.Use Tools that Automatically Detect VulnerabilitiesAny package can have vulnerabilities that put our app at risk.This can be tamed using community and commercial tools to check for them.This way, we can patch them as fast as we can.We don’t want to do this tedious task manually all the time.Assign a Transaction ID to Each Log StatementAssigning a transaction ID to each log statement makes them easy to find.This is because Node apps have lots of async code, so it’s hard to know the order in which things are logged without a unique ID for each entry.Without IDs, it’s pretty hard to tell what comes first and what comes later.Set NODE_ENV=productionWe can set NODE_ENV to production so that production optimizations get activated in production.Many NPM packages optimize their code for production.For example, if we forgot to set NODE_ENV to production in production, Express will be slower by a factor of 3.Automated, Atomic and Zero-Downtime DeploymentsAutomated deployments are essential.They let us deploy things without hassle or risk.They also have to be atomic so that we can reverse deployments easily in case anything goes wrong.Any manual steps carry big risks.If we deploy manually, then we deploy less often, and that means even bigger risks.Use an LTS release of Node.jsThe LTS version of Node.js is supported for longer with bug fixes, security updates, and performance improvements.Therefore, we should use them so that we can keep getting updates without upgrading to a new version all the time.If we don’t keep our Node version up to date, then we risk ourselves with vulnerabilities.Don’t Route Logs within an AppLog destinations shouldn’t be hardcoded by developers but it should be defined by the execution environment that they’re running in.This way, our app can log to different places according to the environment it’s running in.Install Packages with npm ciWith npm ci , the packages are installed with the versions from package-lock.json .A clean install is done every time we run it.This way, we won’t have to worry about package discrepancies.Linter Security RulesLinter security rules help us catch security with our Node apps quickly.eslint-plugin-security is an ESLint plugin to help us catch those in a flash.This way, we can fix security issues that are caught right away.Photo by Paul Hanaoka on UnsplashConclusionWe should follow some guidelines when we go to production.They’ll make our lives easier and reduce risks in various ways.Dev GeniusCoding, Tutorials, News, UX, UI and much more related to developmentFollow142 Sign up for Best StoriesBy Dev GeniusThe best stories sent monthly to your email. Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

What’s new with TypeScript 4.0 rc,https://medium.com/@dsebastien/whats-new-with-typescript-4-0-rc-9e5a3d5efdaa?source=tag_archive---------22-----------------------,"Programming,JavaScript,Web Development,Typescript,Coding","TypeScript 4.0 is almost there. The release candidate is here!In this article, I’ll go over everything that’s been announced so far.I’ll only cover the language features. I might write additional posts to cover what’s also coming regarding editor productivity, performance, and bug fixes.Please keep in mind that this is article is based on release candidate release notes and a roadmap, it doesn’t mean that everything will actually be part of the final release as is.Class property inference from constructorsCurrently, when tsc is configured innoImplicitAny mode, the following TS code doesn’t compile:Now that this PR has been merged and thus, as of TS 4.0, the code above will compile and TypeScript will infer the type of x to be string | boolean.This is one more case where TypeScript’s type inference will help us out!Short-circuiting assignment operatorsThis proposal, introduced by Daniel Rentz, corresponds to a TC39 proposal called “proposal-logic-assignment”, which is now in Stage 3 (i.e., almost good to go!).It aims to combine logical operators and assignment expressions. Combined with nullish coalescing, which we’ve got since TS 3.7, we will be able to write more condensed code.Here’s an example given in the proposal:obj1.obj2.obj3.x ??= 42;And the same code without those new short-circuiting operators:obj1.obj2.obj3.x = obj1.obj2.obj3.x ?? 42;As you can see, with support for this, we would have an even more expressive language, and we’d be able to combine checks and assignments, which would be great.As mentioned by Daniel Rosenwasser, we’d get one such operator for each of the logical operators, thus:LeftHandSideExpression &&= AssignmentExpressionLeftHandSideExpression ||= AssignmentExpressionLeftHandSideExpression ??= AssignmentExpressionCorresponding to what we can currently do with:LeftHandSideExpression && (LeftHandSideExpression = AssignmentExpression)LeftHandSideExpression || (LeftHandSideExpression = AssignmentExpression)LeftHandSideExpression ?? (LeftHandSideExpression = AssignmentExpression)Allow unknown on catch clause bindingsCurrently, if you try to add a type annotation to a catch clause, the compiler complains:The code above does not compile and it raises the following error: TS1196: Catch clause variable cannot have a type annotationAt this point, we simply can’t add a type annotation to a catch clause, which is rather sad from a type safety perspective. The problem is that the errors are always considered to be any, which lets us do anything with the object within the catch block.This behavior is simply due to the fact that, originally, the unknown keyword didn’t exist. But now that it does, it would make much more sense to use it here.As pointed out in the comments of this proposal, we could get a new strict flag to let us enforce this by default (i.e., make all catch clause errors to be of type unknown). This would force us to correctly check the type before making use of it within the block.This is one improvement that I’m really interested about!Variadic Tuple TypesBarbaric name for an awesome new feature. If you don’t know about tuples yet, go learn about those first.I’m not the biggest fan of tuples (I generally prefer objects/custom types), but sometimes they can indeed prove useful, for instance while writing tests (or type definitions for weird libraries like React :p).TypeScript 4.0 improves type inference and now allows to correctly type functions dealing with tuples.First of all, it now supports generics when defining tuple types, allowing to use generic types defined on a function for tuple elements. As the release notes state, this means that we can represent higher-order operations on tuples and arrays even when we don’t know the actual types we’re operating over.The release notes include a few examples:As you can see above, the tail function returns an array or elements of type T. That code is simple to write/understand, which is awesome. Thanks to this new feature, you can see that r1 and r2 are correctly typed.The other improvement is that spread elements can now appear anywhere in a tuple; not just at the end:With TS 3.9.x and earlier, couldn’t compile. With TS 4.0, we will be able to do this and the compiler will happily flatten the spreads, wherever they are positioned.As explained in the release notes, by combining those two features, we can now better type things like the concat function:Awesome!These new type inference improvements will have a great impact on the quality of our code and I can’t wait to use those in production.Check out the complete release notes for more details. For instance, they also cover how this will improve use cases like function composition and partial arguments application.Labeled Tuple ElementsAnother proposal, introduced by Brian Kim, aims to give us the capability of defining labels for tuple elements.Currently, tuples are declared like this:// length, counttype Segment = [number, number];Since we can’t assign labels to the tuple elements, the simplest (but really ugly) solution is to rely on comments to remind us of what each element corresponds to.The other solution (cleaner) is to use custom types that have more useful names. Still, there’s room for improvement.Some languages such as C# and Python for instance support this.If this gets added to the language, then we would be able to create more expressive tuples much more simply:type Segment = [length: number, count: number];Here, by taking a look at the tuple, we directly know what each number corresponds to.This would be really useful to clearly understand what tuples are composed of. In addition, as mentioned in the proposal, it would also add more expressiveness to APIs that manipulate/return tuples.As stated by Daniel Rosenwasser, tuple element names won’t enforce anything in the type system; they’ll exist purely to communicate intent.Adapt TypeScript’s support for ReactJust like TypeScript, React moves crazy fast.Since I’ve published my book about TypeScript, React, Angular and Vue, things have continued to evolve. My chapter about React remains relevant, but the React.createElement API is changing.Since TypeScript supports JSX, it indeed needs to follow those evolutions. This is tracked in this issue and a PR has been opened already. That modification should be included in TS 4.0.1.Next to that, support for custom JSX factories will land in TS 4.0, allowing us to customize the fragment factory through the jsxFragmentFactory option. Check out the release notes and the following PR for details about this.Breaking changesA few breaking changes are planned with TS 4.0:lib.d.ts has changed (DOM types have been adapted), meaning that we could face some new compilations errors when upgrading to this new release. For one, thedocument.origin property, which has been obsolete for quite a while, has been removedOverriding accessors with properties (or vice versa) is now considered as an error in all cases. Previously is only raised an error when useDefineForClassfields was used. So if you have derived classes that override getters/setters of the base class, then you’ll have compilation errors with TS 4.0. Check out the PR for detailsWith TS 4.0, when in strictNullChecks mode (i.e., always, right??!), the operand of the delete operator MUST be any , unknown , never or be optional (i.e., containing undefined ); otherwise the code doesn’t compile. Check out the PR for detailsDeprecationsThe old factory functions for producing TS AST nodes has been deprecated since a new node factory API is being introduced by TS 4.0.This shouldn’t be an issue for the vast majority of projects.New WebsiteTypeScript has a brand new Website. The new version is super fast and the playground is more powerful than ever; it’s now possible to select the version of TypeScript to use, run the code, adapt the compiler’s configuration, etc.Really cool work, I believe mainly by https://twitter.com/orta!ConclusionIn this article, I’ve gone through what’s been announced for TypeScript 4.0. We already have a release candidate, so the final release is not far away at this point. Can’t wait to get it! :)Liked this article?

Update lifecycle of a class-based React component,https://itnext.io/update-lifecycle-of-a-class-based-react-component-f0cb800a8aca?source=tag_archive---------23-----------------------,"React,Web Development,JavaScript","Update lifecycleThe previous article was about the lifecycle hooks of a class-based component when it is being created. In this article, we will see the hooks that come into play when a class-based component is updated.When is a component updated?A component is updated when there are changes made to the component’s props or state. When this happens, the component is re-evaluated and goes through a different lifecycle than the creation lifecycle.1. getDerivedStateFromPropsSince this hook gives us state derived from the changes in props, it is the very first lifecycle hook invoked when a component is updated.It checks whether there have been any changes made to the props and derives the new state from these changes. Just like in the creation lifecycle, this lifecycle hook is rarely necessary, since there will most probably be a more elegant solution available.2. shouldComponentUpdateThis lifecycle hook is invoked after getDerivedStateFromProps and before the render function and allows us to cancel the update process. It can be used to let React know whether the changes in the state or props of the component affect the component’s output. For performance optimizations, we can then decide whether React should continue updating and re-rendering the component.By default, a component will re-render on every state change, but with this hook, we can prevent unnecessary re-renders. This makes this hook pretty powerful since we can prevent unnecessary render cycles. But, if done incorrectly, we might end up blocking an update and break the component.React docs recommend using PureComponent if you are not confident of manually implementing shouldComponentUpdate.3. renderNext comes the render function. If shouldComponentUpdate returns false, which means the component should not update, the render function is not invoked.During the creation lifecycle, the render function evaluates all the JSX and renders the component to the DOM. During the update lifecycle, however, after evaluating the JSX, the render function constructs the virtual DOM and checks if it needs to update the real DOM. If an update is necessary, instead of updating the entire DOM, it compares the virtual DOM and the real DOM and makes changes to only those parts which need updating.This means changing a button’s color will only update that button and not the entire page.4. getSnapshotBeforeUpdateAlthough getSnapshotBeforeUpdate comes after the render function in the update lifecycle of a React component, it is invoked right before any updates are actually committed to the real DOM. This is also a lifecycle hook that is not used often and is mostly used for last-minute operations like capturing some information from the DOM before it is updated.This hook receives the previous state and props as parameters and can either return a snapshot object or null. One use-case of this hook is for capturing the scroll position on the page before the DOM is updated and setting the current scroll position to that value. This will make sure that even after the DOM is re-rendered, the scroll position will remain the same.Any value returned by getSnapshotBeforeUpdate is passed as a parameter to componentDidUpdate.5. componentDidUpdateThis hook is invoked after the render function has finished executing and the DOM has been updated. This hook is not called on the initial render of the page but when the component is updated.Asynchronous tasks like executing HTTP requests can be done in this hook. Although updating state in this hook will not block the updating process since the rendering has finished, we still need to take care since we might end up in an infinite loop of re-renders.If you need to update the state, make sure to use setState() inside a Promise to avoid causing an unnecessary re-render. While this re-render will not cause any visible changes, it will still affect the component’s performance.This hook takes the previous state and props, before the component was updated, as arguments. The previous props can be compared to the current props to check whether it is necessary to execute a network request if the prop has changed. If your component implements the rarely-used getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() lifecycle hook, then componentDidUpdate() will receive a third argument — snapshot. If getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() has not been implemented, the third argument will be undefined.Note: If shouldComponentUpdate() returns false, componentDidUpdate() will not be invokedWrapping upThese are the lifecycle hooks which are invoked when a component goes through an update. In the next article, we will see the useEffect hook which can be used in a functional component in place of these lifecycle hooks.Originally published on my blog.ITNEXTITNEXT is a platform for IT developers & software engineers…Follow25 Thanks to Kiarash Irandoust. ReactWeb DevelopmentJavaScript25 claps25 clapsWritten byNihar RaoteFollowFront-end developer.

Intro,https://medium.com/ngulicode/01-laravel-kesan-pertama-installasi-laravel-571a8c9b7ad4?source=tag_archive---------25-----------------------,"Laravel,Laravel Framework,Experience,Web Development","01 Laravel | Kesan pertama & Installasi LaravelPhoto by Marvin Meyer on UnsplashIntroHello sob, blog ini merupakan postingan pertama dalam series belajar bersama laravel. tujuan dari series blog ini adalah untuk berbagi, belajar bersama, dan juga untuk dokumentasi kalo gua pernah belajar laravel. sering banget soalnya udah belajar banyak eh tau-tau lupa syntax. 😓Ohiye, FYI buat yang belum tau Laravel itu apa, laravel merupakan sebuah framework PHP yang dirancang buat membangun website mulai dari skala kecil hingga besar. dulu gua males sih belajar framework, ngapain sih belajar framework kalau pake PHP native aja udah bisa buat web. dan ternyata setelah gua belajar Laravel, ngapain sih pakai native PHP kalau bisa pake Laravel 😄Gua belajar Laravel belum lama banget sih, belum pantes disebut sesepuh Laravel, pengalaman project laravel baru 2–3 kali, masih perlu jam terbang banyak dan project yang lebih menantang. dulu pertama kali bikin project laravel langsung di kerjaan dong bareng sama Zauvik Rizaldi Ma`ruf. mantep banget dah, kalau disuruh buat fitur baru pasti molor terus soale belajar dulu baru bisa ngerjain fitur. dan kalo ditanya kenapa molor ada aja alesannya sama pak bos. wkkwkw 🤣Salah satu hal yang bikin aku semangat belajar Laravel adalah fitur-fitur magicnya, kesan pertamaku sama Laravel indah sekali wkwkkw 😎. Hal pertama yang aku katakan saat menggunakan fitur-fitur magic Laravel adalah “anj*r 🐕, keren banget ternyata bisa gini yakkk, kenapa aku terlambat kenal Laravel”. selain itu yang bikin aku makin sange sama Laravel yaitu fitur-fitur yang rajin update terus.Ada beberapa hal yang perlu kamu pelajarin sebelum masuk ke Laravel yaitu PHP native, OOPHP, basic HTML JS CSS. kalau elu kenal sama konsep MVC lebih enak lagi belajar Laravel. dulu gua belajar Laravel cuma punya semboyan HARMONI (Harapan Modal Niat).Owhiya Laravel ini dibuat oleh pakde Taylor Otwell, dibuat pertama kali pada 2011 hingga saat blog ini ditulis Laravel sudah sampai versi 7.19.0. matursuwun banget deh sama pakde Taylor. sehat terus pakde Taylor aku tunggu update terbaru Laravel.Oke cukup basa basinya langsung kita sikat Laravel, Laravel yang digunakan dalam series ini adalah Laravel versi 7.x. ada beberapa software yang wajib lo install supaya bisa jalanin project laravel yaituPHP >=7.2.5BCMath PHP ExtensionCtype PHP ExtensionFileinfo PHP ExtensionJSON PHP ExtensionMbstring PHP ExtensionOpenSSL PHP ExtensionPDO PHP ExtensionTokenizer PHP ExtensionXML PHP ExtensionLumayan banyak sih persyaratannya, nah gak perlu install satu-satu, cukup install XAMPP maka otomatis semua yang ada diatas sudah terinstall hehehe 😛. Owhiya lupa satu lagi Composer , FYI Composer adalah package manager yang digunakan untuk memanajemen package-package yang lo perluin. jadi ndak perlu install satu-satu clone repo github packagenya.installasi semua keperluannya silahkan disesuaikan dengan sistem operasi masing-masing. soalnya beda sistem operasi beda cara installnya.Di Laravel ini nanti bakal sering banget berurusan sama Artisan, ngartis dong wkwkw 🤩. kalo kalian cari definisi artisan di wikip*dia pasti bingung. sederhananya gini kalau programmer PHP adalah seorang petani maka alat bajak sawah adalah artisannya.1. Membuat project LaravelAda beberapa cara untuk membuat project laravel, cara yang sering aku pake adalah buat project laravel melalui composer. masuk ke folder yang biasanya sering kamu pake buat ngeproject ketikan command berikutcomposer create-project — prefer-dist laravel/laravel namaProjectmuKetika kalian menjalankan perintah diatas composer bakal membuatkan project laravel buat elo, composer bakal mendowloadkan package-package yang dibutuhkan buat project lo. emang sih prosesnya agak lama tergantung amal dan ibadah koneksi internet lo 🌐Ada alternatif lain untuk buat project laravel yaitu menggunakan laravel global installer, cek di mari. kalo elu pengguna OS windows ada tools keren namanya Laragon, elo wajib coba, cek dimari dahKalau udah selese install project laravel nanti bakalan ada folder yang banyak banget dah dalam folder project laravelmu, nggak usah bingung nggak usah dihapalin itu project fungsi buat apa nanti kalo elo udah sering pake laravel pasti tau sendiri tu folder fungsinya buat paan.2. Jalanin project Laravel kamuUntuk menjalankan project laravel elo, buka terminal/cmd dan pastikan elo berada di folder project laravel yang barusan lo buat kemudian ketikan perintahphp artisan servemenjalankan command php artisan servekemudian masuk ke browser, pergi ke http://localhost:8000 atau http://127.0.0.1 dan tadaaa udah ada halaman default dari laravel 🥳penampakan halaman landing page default dari laravel3. Kenalan sama viewDulu waktu pertama kali jalanin Laravel aku bingung kok bisa tampil halaman kek gitu padahal aku belum buat apa-apa, terus aku cari file index.php. waktu ketemu index.php yang berada di folder public kok bentukannya kayak gitu. dan ternyata halaman default tersebut berada pada folder resources/views/welcome.blade.phpsetelah ketemu dengan welcome.blade.php gua langsung melakukan pengeditan pada halaman tersebut, sebenere banyak banget syntax yang bikin aku gapaham kek misal @if @else dan lain sebagainya. waktu itu bodo amat lah, aku cuma melakukan pengeditan pada konten HTML yang aku pahamin. dulu bisa ngedit gini aja udah seneng banget 😭4. Gimana caranya nambahin halaman baru (routing & view)Puas bermain-main dengan halaman landing page aku pun pengen nambahin halaman baru. bermodalkan tutorial dari youtube aku menemukan cara menambahkan halaman baru. untuk menambahkan halaman baru masuk ke folder routes/web.php.routes/web.php | menambahkan route /aboutRoute digunakan untuk membuat routing atau pengalamatan dalam website, gua langsung nambahin route baru /about. Di dalam function(){} kamu bisa masukin string biasa ataupun markup HTMLnampilin string biasaroutes/web.php | kode nampilin string biasahasil tampilan pada browser | string biasaNampilin HTMLroutes/web.php | kode nampilin HTMLhasil tampilan pada browser | HTMLtapi yakali kita nulis HTML kek gitu 🤯. maka dari itu kita gunakan view untuk mempermudah penulisan HTML pada file terpisahreturn view(‘about’) digunakan untuk memberi tahu si Laravel kalau route yang kamu buat itu diarahkan ke about.blade.php yang berada pada folder resources/views.5. Gimana cara nambahin assetssetelah puas bermain main dengan banyak halaman, hal pertama yang pengen aku lakuin adalah gimana pake css bootstrap disini. biar tampilannya makin kece. untuk menambahkan assets seperti css bootstrap, javascript, ataupun gambar maka tambahkan file-file assets tersebut kedalam folder publicmanagement asset pada folder publicmenggunakan bootstrap pada halaman about.bladetampilan pada browser http://localhost:8000/aboutketika gua berhasil pake bootstrap pada halaman about.blade.php dah seneng banget, tapi ketika aku melakukan perubahan pada routing /about aku ubah jadi /about/our-team tampilanku jadi berantakantampilan about/our-teamhal ini terjadi karena Laravel mengira bahwa file bootstrap.css berada pada path http://localhost:8000/about/bootstrap.css , padahal harusnya berada pada http://localhost:8000/bootstrap.css. untuk mengatasi permasalahan ini maka ubah kode bagian import boostrap css menjadi seperti iniatau cara lain seperti inidengan begini laravel dapat membaca lokasi file bootstrap dengan benar.6. Laravel punya pedang (blade templating engine)salah satu hal yang bikin aku bingung dulu adalah kenapa nama view ku ada embel-embelnya *.blade.php yak. ternyata blade adalah sebuah template engine yang disediakan oleh Laravel. tujuan dari template engine adalah mempermuah penulisan kode PHP yang ditulis bersamaan dengan HTML.Kalo kalian mau menampilkan suatu nilai variabel di PHP native kan biasanya ginimenampilkan isi variabel dengan php nativekalo pake template engine blade jadinya ginimenampilkan isi variabel dengan bladenah lohh jadi lebih simpel kan kalau pake blade, selain itu ada beberapa lagi kemudahan kalau pake blade, misalnyakalo pake native php@if pada blademenampilkan data array dengan foreach nativemenampilkan array dengan @foreach pada blade7. Menggabungkan file blade dengan bantuan @include agar kode tambah rapiAda kondisi dimana koding makin lama makin ribet dan panjang misalnya mau seperti initampilan /about/our-teamkode about.blade.phpagar kodenya lebih rapi maka lebih baik kalau navbar dan konten dipisah, maka dari itu kode navbar aku pisah kedalam file navbar.blade.php terus aku masukkan ke dalam folder componentsviews/components/navbar.blade.phpdalam file about.blade.php tinggal @include file navbar.blade.phpabout.blade.php8. Membuat master layoutoke katakanlah tampilan home dibuat menjadi seperti initampilan homedan tampilan about/our-team seperti inilogikanya tampilan home dan about itu tampilannya sama aja cuman isi kontennya berbeda kita bisa membuat seperti itu dengan kode blade.php yang sama tapi tinggal rubah kontennya aja biar bedacoba perhatikan overall kodenya sama cuma beda kode yang digaris bawah warna merah, sebenarnya elu koding kek gitu enggak salah. tapi ibarat bangun rumah elu bangun 2 rumah yang bentukannya sama, cuma beda warna cat aja tapi elu beli desain rumahnya 2 kali, kan boross dan ga efektif 🤕maka dari itu template engine blade menyediakan solusi untuk ini, yaitu kombinasi @extends @yield dan @section . Buat satu file bernama app.blade.php yang akan digunakan sebagai master layout, umumnya master layout diletakan pada folder resources/views/layoutsresources/views/layouts/app.blade.phpselanjutnya view home dan about tinggal mengikuti (extends) dari layout masterview home dan aboutkalo kode diatas dijalankan maka hasilnya menjadi seperti iniemang bener sih kodenya jadi lebih efektif tapi tampilannya menjadi tidak teratur navbarnya menjadi dibawawh konten, hal ini dikarenakan halaman home dan about ditampilkan terlebih dahulu baru setelah itu mengektends tampilan master, agar hal ini tidak terjadi maka diperlukan @yield dan juga @section , sederhananya @yield digunakan sebagai patokan peletakan konten. terus yang konten yang berada di dalam @section(‘contents’) akan diisikan kedalam @yield(‘contents’)penggunaan @yield pada master layout app.blade.php@section untuk mendefinisikan isi konten dari masing-masing viewjangan lupa untuk menutup @section dengan @endsection, kalau kita lihat dibrowser tampilannya menjadi seperti ini , tadaaaaa 🤤view homeview about9. Belajar dengan contoh nyataagar lebih paham materinya paling enak belajar langsung pake studi kasus, studi kasus yang aku gunain buat belajar adalah membuat website pendaftaran tempat kursusclone template dari repo github iniajisyahroni/alfabank-registrasiweb registrasi alfabank.

You can launch a    // login dialog with a user gesture, but the user may have    // to log in to Facebook before authorizing your application.  } });โดยเมื่อ User ระบุตัวตนเสร็จสิ้นแล้ว ผลลัพธ์ JSON จะเป็นดังนี้{    status: 'connected',    authResponse: {        accessToken: '...',        expiresIn:'...',        signedRequest:'...',        userID:'...'    }}โดยในส่วนของรายละเอียด Status คือconnected คือ ผู้ใช้เข้าสู่ระบบ Facebook และเข้าสู่ระบบหน้าเว็บของคุณแล้วnot_authorizedคือ ผู้ใช้เข้าสู่ระบบ Facebook และเข้าสู่ระบบหน้าเว็บของคุณแล้วunknownคือ ผู้ใช้เข้าสู่ระบบ Facebook และเข้าสู่ระบบหน้าเว็บของคุณแล้วหากสถานะเป็น connected แล้ว พารามิเตอร์ authResponse ต่อไปนี้จะถูกแสดงออกมาaccessTokenโทเค็นการเข้าถึงสำหรับผู้ที่ใช้หน้าเว็บexpiresInการประทับเวลา UNIX เมื่อโทเค็นหมดอายุ เมื่อโทเค็นหมดอายุ ผู้ใช้จะต้องเข้าสู่ระบบใหม่อีกครั้งreauthorize_required_inปริมาณเวลาก่อนการเข้าสู่ระบบจะหมดอายุ และผู้ใช้จะต้องเข้าสู่ระบบใหม่ในอีกไม่กี่วินาทีsignedRequestพารามิเตอร์ที่ลงนามซึ่งมีข้อมูลผู้ใช้ที่ใช้หน้าเว็บของคุณuserID ID ของผู้ที่ใช้หน้าเว็บเพื่อที่จะเพิ่มประสิทธิภาพของการตรวจสอบสถานะของ User อาจจะมีการเพิ่ม true ไปในท้ายของฟังชันก์ได้FB.getLoginStatus(function(response) {  // this will be called when the roundtrip to Facebook has completed}, true);การนำผู้ใช้เข้าสู่ระบบการนำ User เข้าสู่ระบบของ Facebook นั้นสามารถทำได้ 2 วิธีด้วยกัน นั่นก็คือสร้างปุ่มเข้าสู่ระบบ Facebookกล่องการเข้าสู่ระบบ จาก JavaScript SDK1.การสร้างปุ่มเข้าสู่ระบบในการสร้างปุ่มเข้าสู่ระบบ จะมีปลั๊กอินสำหรับการสร้างปุ่มในเว็บไซต์ Facebook for Developer อยู่แล้ว โดยหน้าตาจะเป็นประมาณนี้ปลั๊กอินสร้างปุ่มเมื่อกด รับรหัส แล้ว หน้าตาจะเป็นแบบนี้JavaScript SDKในที่นี้ ผมได้ทำการสมัคร Facebook Developer และได้สร้างหน้าต่างแอปที่ชื่อว่า Basic snake game ไว้ก่อนแล้วโดยถ้าหากต้องการสร้างปุ่ม Continue as {User}ในส่วนของโค้ด JavaScript SDK ในขั้นตอนที่ 3 จากรูปด้านบน ให้เปลี่ยน data-user-continue-as=""false""เป็นdata-user-continue-as=""true""ในการเพิ่มลูกเล่นในระหว่างรอการเข้าสู่ระบบก็เป็นอีกลูกเล่นหนึ่งที่ทำให้ผู้ใช้รู้ว่า ระบบยังมีการทำงานอยู่ ซึ่งอาจใช้ตัวยึดตำแหน่ง (Placeholder) หรือ สัญลักษณ์หมุน(Spinner) โดยสามารถดูตัวอย่างโค้ดในการสร้างสัญลักษณ์ตัวหมุนได้ดังนี้<script>var finished_rendering = function() {  console.log(""finished rendering plugins"");  var spinner = document.getElementById(""spinner"");  spinner.removeAttribute(""style"");  spinner.removeChild(spinner.childNodes[0]);}FB.Event.subscribe('xfbml.render', finished_rendering);</script><div id=""spinner""    style=""        background: #4267b2;        border-radius: 5px;        color: white;        height: 40px;        text-align: center;        width: 250px;"">    Loading    <div    class=""fb-login-button""    data-max-rows=""1""    data-size=""large""    data-button-type=""continue_with""    data-use-continue-as=""true""    ></div></div>โดย ในส่วนของ <div>จะเป็นตัว html ในการแสดงผลของสัญลักษณ์หมุน และ <scrip>t`นั้นจะเป็นส่วนที่จัดการการปิดตัวหมุนเมื่อโหลดเสร็จสิ้นแล้ว2.การเข้าสู่ระบบด้วยกล่องเข้าสู่ระบบ JavaScript SDKถ้าหากต้องการใช้กล่องการเข้าสู่ระบบของตนเอง ให้เรียกใช้กล่องการเข้าสู่ระบบโดยเรียกไปยัง FB.login()FB.login(function(response){  // handle the response });เมื่อผู้ใช้คลิกปุ่มการเข้าสู่ระบบของกล่องเข้าสู่ระบบ จะมีป๊อปอัพที่มีกล่องการเข้าสู่ระบบปรากฏขึ้น โดยกล่องนี้จะช่วยขอสิทธิ์การอนุญาตเพื่อเข้าถึงข้อมูลของผู้ใช้ได้ โดยสามารถส่ง พารามิเตอร์ scope ที่เป็นรายการสิทธิ์การอนุญาตตัวอย่างการเรียกFB.login(function(response) {  // handle the response}, {scope: 'public_profile,email'});การตอบสนองการเชื่อมต่อหรือการยกเลิกเชื่อมต่อจะส่งคืน Object authResponse ดังเช่น ตัวอย่าง JSON ข้างบน กลับไปยังที่ระบุเมื่อเรียก FB.login() โดยที่ระบบจะสามารถจัดการการตอบสนองภายใน FB.login()ตัวอย่างการเรียกFB.login(function(response) {  // handle the response}, {scope: 'public_profile,email'});การนำผู้ใช้ออกจากระบบสามารถทำได้โดย้ใช้ JavaScript SDK FB.logout() ไปกับปุ่มหรือลิ้งค์ที่สร้างไว้ได้ตัวอย่างการเรียกFB.logout(function(response) {   // Person is now logged out});หมายเหตุ การเรียกฟังก์ชันนี้อาจนำผู้ใช้ออกจากระบบ Facebook ด้วยตัวอย่างโค้ดแบบเต็ม<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>Facebook Login JavaScript Example</title><meta charset=""UTF-8""></head><body><script>  function statusChangeCallback(response) {  // Called with the results from FB.getLoginStatus().    console.log('statusChangeCallback');    console.log(response);                   // The current login status of the person.    if (response.status === 'connected') {   // Logged into your webpage and Facebook.      testAPI();      } else {                                 // Not logged into your webpage or we are unable to tell.      document.getElementById('status').innerHTML = 'Please log ' +        'into this webpage.';    }  }  function checkLoginState() {               // Called when a person is finished with the Login Button.

ในอุปกรณ์อื่นๆที่ไม่ใช่ Smart Phone, Laptop หรือ PC นั้น การพิมชื่อผู้ใช้และรหัสอาจะเป็นเรื่องยาก ซึ่งทาง Facebook ก็มีการออกแบบการเข้าสู่ระบบที่ลดการพิมชื่อและรหัสของผู้ใช้ในการเข้าสู่ระบบ ซึ่งมีหลักการที่จะทำให้ผู้ใช้มีประสบการณ์ที่ดีในการเข้าถึง Facebook ใน TV ของพวกเขาครับ1. การกระตุ้นให้ผู้ใช้ดำเนินการผู้พัฒนาแอปพลิเคชันต้องคำนึงถึงว่า ขั้นตอนที่ผู้ใช้นั้นต้องการที่จะเข้าสู่ระบบควรอยู่ส่วนใดของแอปพลิเคชัน และออกแบบปุ่มที่แสดงให้เห็นชัดว่าเป็นปุ่มที่ใช้ในการเข้าสู่ระบบถ้าหากต้องการให้ผู้ใช้สามารถใช้การได้ดี และน่าเชื่อถือได้มากที่สุด ควรออกแบบปุ่มเข้าสู่ระบบด้วย Facebook อย่างเป็นทางการให้มากที่สุด ซึ่งควรประกอบด้วย1. เขียนปุ่มว่าเข้าสู่ระบบด้วย Facebook หรือ เชื่อมต่อกับ Facebook2. ใช้สีของ Facebook ซึ่งก็คือ สีขาวและสีน้ำเงิน Facebook: 1877F2 3. สามารถใช้โลโก้ “f” ซึ่งโลโก้ควรเป็นสีของ Facebook เช่นกัน2. การแสดงโค้ดหลังจากที่ผู้ใช้กดปุ่มเข้าสู่ระบบแล้ว API ของ Facebook จะทำการแสดงโค้ดขึ้นบนหน้าจอของผู้ใช้โดยจะมีข้อความแจ้งเตือน ขั้นต่อไปแสดงให้เห็นว่าควรทำอย่างไรต่อไป ในที่นี้จะเป็น (“ขั้นต่อไป ให้ไปที่ facebook.com/device”) เข้าเว็บไซต์นี้ผ่านทาง Smart phone หรือ laptop จากนั้นจึงกรอกโค้ดนี้ลงไปผู้พัฒนาสามารถใส่ปุ่ม close หรือ cancel เพื่อเป็นการยกเลิกการเข้าสู่ระบบและกลับไปยังหน้าแรกได้อีกด้วย อีกทั้งตัวโค้ดนี้ยังมีอายุจำกัดอีกด้วย ซึ่งถ้าหากผู้ใช้ไม่ได้ใส่โค้ดในระยะเวลาที่กำหนด การเข้าสู่ระบบจะแสดงข้อผิดพลาด code_expired เมื่อได้รับข้อผิดพลาดนี้ แอปพลิเคชันควรกลับไปเริ่มขั้นตอนการเข้าสู่ระบบอีกครั้งเพื่อกะตุ้นให้มีการสร้างโค้ดใหม่3. การอนุญาตการอนุญาตนี้จะหมายถึงเมื่อผู้ใช้เข้าสู่เว็บไซต์ facebook.com/device จากเบราว์เซอร์ใน laptop หรือ smart phone ซึ่งจะแสดงหน้าต่างดังนี้หลังจากที่ผู้ใช้กรอกโค้ดและกด continue เสร็จเรียบร้อยแล้วจะได้หน้าต่างดังนี้โดยเมื่อเสร็จสิ้นขั้นตอนการเช้าสู่ระบบจะเสร็จสิ้นเมื่อขึ้นข้อความยืนยัน4.ยืนยันการเข้าสู่ระบบสำเร็จเมื่อผู้ใช้ยืนยันผ่านlaptop หรือ smart phone เสร็จสิ้นแล้ว ตัวแอปพลิเคชันควรแสดงปุ่ม continue เพื่อแสดงให้ผู้ใช้เห็นว่าเข้าสู่ระบบเสร็จสิ้นแล้ว5.ออกจากระบบหรือเลิกเชื่อมต่อควรที่จะมีปุ่ม Log out from Facebook หรือ Disconnect from Facebook ในเมนูในแอปพลิชัน โดยเมื่อผู้ใช้กดปุ่มออกจากระบบแล้ว ควรลบ token การเข้าถึงจากอุปกรณ์ออกจากหน่วยความจำ และแสดงหน้าแรกการเข้าสู่ระบบอีกครั้งการใช้การเข้าสู่ระบบสำหรับอุปกรณ์การสร้างแอปพลิเคชันของ Apple TV ควรใช ้Facebook SDK สำหรับ tvOS และการสร้างแอปพลิเคชันของ Android TV ควรใช้ Facebook SDK สำหรับ Androidการเข้าสู่ระบบ Facebook อุปกรณ์จำเป็นต้องสามารถที่จะเรียก HTTP โดยตรงจากทางอินเตอร์เน็ต การเรียก API

การแสดงโค้ดอุปกรณ์ควรแสดง user_code และแจ้งผู้ใช้ให้ไปที่ facebook.com/device บน smart phone หรือ laptop4. การตรวจสอบสถานะการอนุญาตอุปกรณ์ควรตรวจสอบสถานะของ API

Front End vs Back End: A Helpful Cheat Sheet — Jamie Pittman,https://medium.com/swlh/front-end-vs-back-end-a-helpful-cheat-sheet-jamie-pittman-9475357fc0df?source=tag_archive---------28-----------------------,"Front End Development,Back End Development,Web Development,Coding,Women In Tech","Photo by Dean Pugh on UnsplashAre you front end or back end?That statement always makes me giggle! I know, I know. I’m immature. But you’re going to hear this question a lot if you choose to go into tech, so be prepared to swallow your childish giggles.If you are looking to embark on a career change into programming, you may be trying to figure out what the differences are between front end development and back end development. Although their main focus is different, each role is critical to the success of the other and you will likely be working day-to-day with someone in your “opposite” role.Front End vs Back End : It’s nice to have an idea of what your peers are doing and responsible for maintaining. It might also be a good way to figure out what it would take to transition to a full-stack development role.What is front end development?Front end development involves maintaining those parts of a website or application/app that are visible.What technologies do front end developers use?HTML — HyperText Markup LanguageCSS — Cascading Style SheetsJavaScriptJavaScript FrameworksReactAngular (sometimes known as Angular 2+)AngularJSVue.jsTesting libraries: Jest, Mocha, Cypress, etcIn my experiences as a front end developer, I have had to utilize all of these technologies. I’ve run across some articles that do not mention using a JavaScript framework as part of what is required of a front end developer, but I have used a framework at every single dev job I’ve had.But don’t let the sound of a framework scare you! I think they help you to improve your JavaScript skills-especially if you’re using React. The other great thing is that once you learn one framework, it’s easy to transfer those skills to another-even though they may not be exactly alike.In addition to using a framework, you’ll also most likely be using some sort of testing library. I wouldn’t stress too much on making sure this is on your resume as it varies from shop to shop.What is back end development?Back end development involves maintaining those parts of a website or application/app that are “under the hood” so to speak. I am not a back end developer, but I was technically trained as a full-stack developer. I am aware of some technologies but not all.What technologies do back end developers use?PHPNode.jsRubyPythonJava.NETOther tools related to data like SQL, Oracle, MongoDBIn most places that I’ve worked, any handling of “the cloud” is also handled by backend teams. This obviously varies quite a bit depending on the size of the organization that you’re working for as well.I would say most of the back end developers I’ve encountered work with Java. The job I’m getting ready to transition to, their back end is built in Python.If you’re trying to figure out what language or technology would be best, I suggest looking at job postings and seeing what they’re requesting under requirements. You can see the jobs that you’re interested in and what it will take in order to land a job.Front End vs Back End: ResourcesIf you’re looking to get started learning some of the technologies referenced above, check out these resources. Some of them are free! Those that aren’t are very reasonably priced. I would suggest starting with these resources before you consider embarking on a coding bootcamp.Free Code CampLinkedIn Learning — Your company might be subscribed, so this may be free for you!!Level Up Tutorials / Scott TolinskiWes BosSyntax PodcastYouTube — so many tutorials!!Originally published at https://jamiepittman.com on August 8, 2020.The StartupMedium's largest active publication, followed by +723K people.

How I develop locally — Laragon,https://medium.com/@pravnkay/how-i-develop-locally-laragon-7080c2b134e2?source=tag_archive---------30-----------------------,"Laragon,Local Development,Web Development,Laravel,Xampp","Laragon launch windowWhen I first started developing websites, I googled for a local development setup and landed at Xampp. It was all good until my requirements changed from developing at one spot to be able to access the same development setup at multiple locations. The main difficulty I faced was setting up of virtual domains for each local site instance at each of my work stations. I was majorly working with Laravel at this moment. And, that when I found Laragon !What is Laragon ?Laragon is a super powerful local development setup software, which comes in as an all-in-one package providing support to popular requirements like Latest PHP, MySQL, Apache/Nginx, Node, NPM and more. Its just a one click installation and one click start.So, why Laragon ?I first installed Laragon as only a test setup to test the new-waters. But on that same day itself I switched over to the new setup. Here are the reasons why I did so.#1 Simplicity of setting upTo install and setup the previous local development setup I had to download multiple software from multiple sources that include Apache server, a command line to be integrated, Git, NodeJS, NPM. But with laragon its all a one package download and install and you get all of the above in a single installation. I felt that was so easy.Yet, the simplicity part doesn’t end there. After installing the development requirements, to start actual development process it again takes one click to install an instance of Laravel / Wordpress / Drupal and the likes. And, that just felt like icing on the cake.#2 Virtual DomainsI don’t know how everyone does it, but i heavily rely on virtual domains to separate my local development sites and even my client works and my side projects. Setting up of virtual domains was a breeze with Laragon. All you had to do was, do nothing.It takes care of setting up of virtual domains for each folder that you paste in the www directory of the installed server instance. `.test` is the default domain used and that was a breeze to setup.#3 PerformanceThough an installation of XAMPP which I was using previously was taking considerably less HDD space compared to Laragon, one main problem I always had with XAMPP is the memory usage. Upon running a full day, its memory usage kept increasing and finally makes my ‘somewhat okay’ PC not-okay. Also, the time XAMPP takes to boot is really high. And, the server restarts gets me diverted to my mobile scrolling through social media streams.With Laragon, all of these problems just vanished. It starts up with seconds of clicking the shortcut. Boots up the server and database within seconds, restarts the server within a blink (usually for creating a new virtual domain for the newly added folder) and lastly but most importantly, never goes beyond control in memory usage. In fact, it keep my dual core processor 4GB RAM side PC pretty happy with the development work. And, I am happy that I found Laragon#4 Extra quirksThere are several extra quirks I get with the Laragon installation. To list them all,Ngrok.io instance built-in — Useful to share my local domain to a remote client again, in a couple of clicks. Simplicity integrated.Command Line — The built in command line is so options friendly and user friendly than the one I used to integrate previously. It even gets focused on VS Code’s shortcut but still you have to start in the first time.Git — We all use git. Laragon has it pre-installed. End of story.Notepad++ — This may be a personal advantage. I use Notepad++ as my secondary text editor to VS Code for opening individual files rather than projects and guess what, it comes pre-installed. Happy.All said, I am really happy that I found Laragon and since then I have never looked back.

When Recursion Comes to Rescue,https://medium.com/swlh/when-recursion-comes-to-rescue-98d726fe1a7b?source=tag_archive---------31-----------------------,"JavaScript,Algorithms,Programming,Coding,Web Development","Photo by Kevin Ku on UnsplashWhen practicing solving algorithm problems, we often see questions that make us wonder if we would ever encounter similar situations in the real world (e.g. spiral traversal of a matrix).This time, however, I came across an interesting algorithm challenge that makes practical sense to me.Here’s the task:You are given a list of tasks, some of which depend on others.Write a function tasksInOrder that takes a subset of those tasks and returns an ordered list of all the tasks to run.To illustrate:const tasks = [  {  task: ""make a sandwich"",  depends: [ ""buy groceries"" ]  },  {  task: ""buy groceries"",  depends: [ ""go to the store"" ]  },   {  task: ""go to the store"",  depends: []  }]// tasksInOrder(tasks, [""make a sandwich""])// -> [ 'go to the store', 'buy groceries', 'make a sandwich' ]// tasksInOrder(tasks, [""buy groceries"", ""make a sandwich""])// -> [ 'go to the store', 'buy groceries', 'make a sandwich' ]We all make to-do lists in our daily lives, so I was glad to finally see a function that we can actually put to good, practical use.Brute Force ApproachAs I read the challenge, the first thing that came to mind was a linked-list data structure, as each task has a dependency, or node, which points to another task.With that, I was able to quickly write out a straightforward (but flawed) solution that traverses both the task list and the given subset.function tasksInOrder(tasks, subset) {  let result = []  for (let task of tasks) {    if (task.depends.length !== 0) {      result.unshift(task.depends[0])    }  }  for (let sub of subset) {    result.push(sub)  }  return [...new Set(result)]}The solution above does output the desired results in the two sample cases:// tasksInOrder(tasks, [""make a sandwich""])// -> [ 'go to the store', 'buy groceries', 'make a sandwich' ]// tasksInOrder(tasks, [""buy groceries"", ""make a sandwich""])// -> [ 'go to the store', 'buy groceries', 'make a sandwich' ]However, this solution would fail if out task list is not in order:const tasksNotInOrder = [   {  task: ""buy groceries"",  depends: [ ""go to the store"" ]  },   {  task: ""make a sandwich"",  depends: [ ""buy groceries"" ]  },  {  task: ""go to the store"",  depends: []  }]// tasksInOrder(tasksNotInOrder, [""buy groceries""])// expected -> [ 'go to the store', 'buy groceries' ]// got -> [ 'buy groceries', 'go to the store' ]So, how might we follow the dependencies of the given subset that keep recurring in the tasks list in the right order?Recursive ApproachIn order to grab all the dependencies of all the subtasks in the subset, we can:Grab all the dependencies of one subtaskAdd the dependencies to an array by prepending them, so we can put them in orderRepeat step#2 until the subtask has no dependencySince the recursive solution occurs in the subtasks, we can separate concerns by creating a helper function that focuses on recursion:function tasksInOrder(tasks, subset) {  let tasksList = []  for (let subTask of subset) {    let foundTask = tasks.find(taskObj => taskObj.task === subTask)    // invoke helper function    getDependedTasks(foundTask, tasksList, tasks)  }}// helper functionfunction getDependedTasks(currentTask, tasksList, tasks) {  // prepend the current task  tasksList.unshift(currentTask)  // base case: when we hit the task with no dependency  if (currentTask.depends.lenth === 0) {    return  }  // recursive case:     // (1) find the task which the current task depends on    // (2) run the function recursively with the found task  let nextTask = tasks.find(taskObj => taskObj.task === currentTask.depends[0])  return getDependedTasks(nextTask, tasksList, tasks)}And voilà! With this approach, we see an output of an orderly tasks list, no matter how disorganized the original list is.Do you see any potential flaws in the recursive approach? Can you think of any other way to tackle this challenge? As always, please let me know in the comments.The StartupMedium's largest active publication, followed by +723K people.

Create a Basic ReactJS Image Wheel Carousel,https://medium.com/@anobjectisa/create-a-basic-reactjs-image-wheel-carousel-3756011eaac4?source=tag_archive---------32-----------------------,"Programming,JavaScript,Web Development,Front End Development,Reactjs","Shake up your image gallery designs…The general idea of what we’re going to do is this:We’re going to create two components.The first component is going to render a JSX DIV element in the center of the screen that we’ll use as the center of our wheel.The second component is going to render a JSX DIV element that we’ll use to hold a single image.When we rotate that center DIV, all of the cards will rotate in a circle.Let’s begin.We’ll start by creating a “Wheel.js” ReactJS CLASS component.It’s here that the bulk of the state for the carousel will be handled.Note:1. We can control how far out the images position themselves from the center using ‘radius’.2. We keep track of the degree to which the wheel is rotated with two variables — theta and temp_theta — one in the state, and one simply in the constructor that we use as an intermediary.3. We keep all of the cards/images in a ‘cards’ array.To complete the setup of our “Wheel.js”, we’ll render one JSX DIV element.Note:We need a reference to this div so we can manipulate it later.Let’s quickly jump to our ‘Card.js’ component for a moment.We’ll create a “Card.js” ReactJS FUNCTION component.There will be one JSX DIV element; we can put an image in there later.Note:We’ve given the card/image an arbitrary ‘height’, ‘width’, and ‘backgroundColor’. We can change this later when we insert an image.Let’s jump back to our ‘Wheel.js’ component and add some Cards.We’ll do this in the ‘componentDidMount()’ life cycle function.Note:1. We calculate the center of our “Wheel.js” and pass that, the ‘radius’, and ‘radian_interval’ state variables.2. The ‘key’ prop isn’t required, but strongly advised (else you will receive a runtime warning).Now comes the hard stuff.How are we going to re-position the cards to display around our wheel? A bit of Trigonometry.We’re going use the cosine and sine functions to calculate the x and y positions of each card.We do this by taking the angle — we’ll move in 45 degree increments — of where the card is supposed to be.Using sine to calculate the y coordinate.Using cosine to calculate the x coordinate.We’ll handle this in the “Card.js” component.Note:1. I’ve just extrapolated the calculation of the ‘x’ and ‘y’ coordinates to a function. This isn’t needed.2. We include the center of our wheel in the positioning of our card. It may be zero, but we code in for the case where it might not be.Let’s get this thing moving.We’ll just attach an ‘onWheel’ event listener to our JSX DIV in our “Wheel.js” component.Note:1. We scroll the wheel by using ‘event.deltaY’; we multiply by 0.5 to slow it down.2. We keep track of where the wheel has scrolled AFTER the wheel has finished scrolling. We accomplish this by setting a timeout function, keeping track of that function with a variable ‘this.anim_id’ (which I’ve added to the constructor, NOT THE STATE), and clearing that timeout until the last spin of the wheel.Lastly, let’s add some images to our carousel.If you would like a more in-depth guide, check out my full video tutorial on YouTube, An Object Is A.Build a ReactJS Circular Image Carousel From Scratch (Web Design) (2020)Written byAn Object Is ALearning to code…FollowProgrammingJavaScriptWeb DevelopmentFront End DevelopmentReactjsMore from An Object Is AFollowLearning to code…More From MediumVisual Music: What to Learn from Bellagio’s FountainsSean Zhai in JavaScript In Plain EnglishThe Beginner’s Guide to Contributing to the Mozilla Firefox CodebaseSahil Bhosale in Better ProgrammingJSON in Golang an IntroductionCiaran Mcveigh in The StartupIntroduction to Vue.js TemplatesJohn Au-Yeung in JavaScript In Plain EnglishIntroducing the JavaScript Window Object — VisibilityState and Child ElementsJohn Au-Yeung in JavaScript In Plain EnglishExploring the differences between Promises and Callbacks in JavaScriptChristian Otieno in The StartupForm Validation with Angular Template-Driven FormsJohn Au-Yeung in The StartupThe Ultimate Guide to Electron with ReactAditya Patnaik in FOLK DevelopersAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
A journey from individual Angular projects to an Angular workspace,https://medium.com/@kalpshekhar/a-journey-from-individual-angular-projects-to-an-angular-workspace-6f2e302e9338?source=tag_archive---------33-----------------------,"Angular,Workspace,Web Development,Web App Development,Front End Development","We came across a new project that required a web-based application to be developed for the public users and at the same time allow administrators that are internal to an organization to do their stuff. Since administrators were internal to an organization only, we decided to go with 2 angular applications.ng-admin-app for the administrators. This will be only accessible inside an organization network and will use a separate set of APIs that are exposed internally for the better security.ng-public-app for the public users. This will be accessible on internet and will use the APIs publicly accessible.Soon after we started realizing that although these 2 apps are developed and deployed differently but are quite related to each other. They are required to share things between each other like common functionalities, CSS etc.Also, occasionally we noticed that one or other of them was using different version of node modules and also we needed a npm registry to share common functionalities between these 2 apps using an angular library. Problem with this was that library itself became an additional project in itself.Before we could think of resolving these problems, there comes a requirement to have an another publicly accessible web-based application to be developed as part of this project. Yes, you’re right! We ended up creating a 3rd angular application.Now we have 3 angular applications ;)ng-admin-appng-public-app-1ng-public-app-2The urgency of finding a solution for the problems arose as the degree of the problems had increased.Soon we figured out that angular workspace can rescue us here. With little effort (using a good IDE) we managed to move all 3 applications and a library into an angular workspace as sub-projects. This helped us with the following:Ensuring same version of node modules for all 3 applications.Ensuring same version of angular for all 3 applications.No need of npm registry and managing library as a separate project anymore.Building and testing all 3 applications and a library at once.Only problem you might see with angular workspace is that it somewhere tightly couple all the sub-projects in terms of future upgrades.However, having a mindset that all applications under a workspace is a single application will help you to overcome this problem :)Thanks for reading this article!

"<strong class=""bt"">What is UltaHost? Services UltaHost Provides</strong>",https://medium.com/@JamesMonti/what-is-ultahost-services-ultahost-provides-8bf33212c244?source=tag_archive---------35-----------------------,"Hosting,Webhosting Service,Website,Creating Content,Web Development","August 8, 2020What is UltaHost?UltaHost is one of the site builders and content management systems with awesome features. UltaHost provides an effective web hosting for a reasonable price, which enables its customers to place and maintain their projects or sites on the world wide web (WWW). It strives to do everything possible for its clients to have a positive experience with hosting service — hence one of the popular web hosting platforms.Mission and vision of UltaHostUltaHost powers many websites, from small personal blogs to complex sites by providing reliable, convenient, and affordable hosting services. Daily, UltaHost ensures a reliable and stable hosting operation, a minimum of 99.5% of the time per year. It guides and provides its clients with full and timely advice on various products and services. Additionally, UltaHost expands hosting services in terms of automating hosting functions and increases the number of sought-after and competitive hosting services. Also, UltaHost creates additional products that are demanded by the market and collaborating partners.Strategy of UltaHostUltaHost utilizes high-quality modern equipment, and large data centers capable of providing a high level of services and high-performance communication channels to provide efficient website hosting services for its clients. Of note, its servers are well equipped with state-of-the-art software, which empowers you to reduce the cost associated with developing and maintaining your project or site. For electronic commerce (e-commerce), the list of services UltaHost provides keeps expanding, that is, from hosting your online stores to fully organizing your business and creating a system for selling your products via the internet. These services are well designed to serve both newcomers (clients who are just beginning their internet market), and clients who need a full organization of the internet market like creating their systems to receive payments via the internet. Furthermore, UltaHost services are increasing daily in various countries unlimited to Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, the Czech Republic, Israel, Portugal, England, Ireland, Canada, and United States of America.UltaHost ServicesHere, I present some of the major services that UltaHost provides for setting up and running your business or personal website.Dedicated ServerWith UltaHost dedicated server, a user can manage the whole server without relying on other clients and can utilize the server capability according to his/her needs. A simple analogy is like having a house with a garage and outdoor territory but disallow access or sharing with your neighbors. Importantly, the Admin of the dedicated server gets full access to the software and hardware -meaning that you in control of the operating and file systems, and if needed you can purchase additional hardware. This type of hosting is unique and necessary for a game server, social network platform, banking site, a large online store, or application, all of which require a lot of resources.Shared HostingUltaHost provides shared hosting services, which are divided into various parts that be rented separately. For instance, several hundred users can locate their sites on one server concomitantly. While it is true that the sites of other clients may be affected if someone uses too much of the server, UltaHost avoids this issue by providing impose restrictions to limit RAM or speed of that user. There is no need to worry if shared hosting will satisfy your needs. In fact, it is the best solution for small projects since most sites do not need all the resources of a whole server. It is very suitable for a business card site, a promotion page, a portfolio, a personal blog, and a small online store.Virtual Private Server (VPS)Another great feature of UltaHost is the provision of a Virtual Private Server (VPS). Usually, this kind of server is subdivided into various independent parts and rented separately. That is, there can be several dozens of virtual serves all on one physical server. Put differently, a VPS can be compared to a complex of private houses, where each house has neighbors, but each family has a separate entrance and its front garden. Even though several servers are located on the physical server, each server is isolated from the rest, so if one virtual server consumes a lot of the resources, it will not affect other users. As a result of this attribute, this type of hosting is appropriate for an online store, a forum with many visitors, an application, or a corporate site where customers and employees have accounts or personal e-mail.Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) CertificateAn SSL certificate is simply a means of protecting the personal information of the users. A green lock and the HTTPS protocol in the address bar of the browser depict any sites with an SSL certificate. This indicates that the site is secured and safe for entering your password or bank card number to do online transactions. UltaHost Provides this service for all its users.The UltaHost offers Sever Supportive ServiceUltaHost technical support team communicates with its customers and to fulfills their numerous requests from 09:00 to 18:00 local time. For instance, at night, if you need to accomplish something, when there is less traffic, you can get an assistance from a support agent.Finally, UltaHost is used by many people worldwide, and it is easy to see why. UltaHost makes the essential tools for any users to create their sites; not only for experienced web developers but also for those with limited or no ideas on website development. The tools can equally support a small personal site, large, and complicated corporate web portal. With an array of great features such as the themes, plugins designed to extend its functions, and a secured system, UltaHost works for all kinds of sites. If you are intending to build a site, you should consider hosting provider like UltaHost, that offers affordable and amazing hosting services.

Migrasi SQL di Golang menggunakan Goose,https://medium.com/@gilangprambudi/migrasi-sql-di-golang-menggunakan-goose-82d80e83239e?source=tag_archive---------36-----------------------,"Go,Sql,Web Development,Dsc,Backend","Photo by Markus Winkler on UnsplashBelum ada server, dev masih di lokal, biar migrasi SQL nya gak susah, bisa pakai tool ini.Sekitar seminggu yang lalu, saya di assign ke suatu kerjaan di posisi backend pada suatu bisnis finansial swasta di Jakarta. Dan saya terkendala dengan infrastruktur development yang belum disediakan. Tau sendiri lah, proses birokrasi di perusahaan seperti itu bagaimana. Padahal sprint development sudah berjalan. Akhirnya proses development antara Backend dan Frontend terhambat karena kendala menyesuaikan developer environment, utamanya adalah setting database / persistence.Hingga kolega saya menginstruksikan saya untuk menggunakan migration tool pada database. Memang sebelumnya saya sudah pernah mencoba migration tool di Laravel ataupun di NodeJS (menggunakan ORM Sequelize), namun belum pernah di Go. Lalu, rekan saya menyarankan library ini:pressly/gooseGoose is a database migration tool. Manage your database schema by creating incremental SQL changes or Go functions.github.comLibrary ini sebenarnya adalah versi fork dari repository aslinya yang ada di bitbucketBitbucketEdit descriptionbitbucket.orgSo, bagaimana cara kerjanya? Let’s explore more!Instalasi dependencyInstall Goose secara global menggunakan command gogo get -u github.com/pressly/goose/cmd/gooseKita akan buat dummy project yang membutuhkan 3 table, users, roles dan user_roles. Database yang digunakan adalah Postgres.Skemanya seperti berikut:Table userTable roleTable user_rolesOk. Case nya seperti ini:User dan Roles memiliki associative table bernama user_roles yang keduanya di relasikan menggunakan id masing-masingPada business usecase, Roles harus memiliki data inisial yaitu Admin dan User ketika program dijalankanDan, thanks to goose, kita bisa membuat file binary yang dapat dijadikan sebagai tool migrasi kita. Sehingga setiap user yang memiliki source code, tidak perlu lagi melakukan manual migrasi SQL dengan cara mengeksekusi file SQL melalui Database Management tools seperti PHPMyAdmin, PGAdmin, Datagrip, ataupun MySQLWorkbench.Step membuat file migrasiSetelah kita install dependency goose, kita eksekusi file binary nya yang terletak di (linux : $GOROOT/bin)Kita eksekusi file tersebut didalam root folder project atau di folder ./db di project kita. (Ini bebas, namun saya prefer membuat folder db yang gunanya untuk menyimpan file-file migrasi*penting! Jika ada foreign key pada DDL, pastikan generate table yang independent terlebih dahuluBuat file migrasi .sql untuk table users$: ~/go/bin/goose create Users sql2. Buat file migrasi .sql untuk table roles$: ~/go/bin/goose create Roles sql3. Buat file migrasi .sql untuk table user_roles$: ~/go/bin/goose create UserRoles sqlNanti, akan di hasilkan 3 file berikut:Untuk prefix nya seperti 20200809002448, belum tentu sama di komputer saudara. Karena itu adalah timestamp ketika dibuatnya file migration.Isi dari file migration seperti berikut:Masih kosong, tapi sangat straight forward. Artinya, dibawah komentar bagian +goose Up, kita isi SQL Statement / DDL yang ingin kita execute (seperti membuat table, menambah data, dll), sedangkan dibawah bagian +goose Down kita isi SQL Statement / DDL yang kita ingin execute ketika proses pembersihan (seperti drop table, truncate, dll)Kita copy kan schema kita ke dalam file yang telah digenerate gooseBuat file goose.gogoose.go akan di compile menjadi file binary yang nantinya akan melakukan proses migrasi. Sehingga user lain tidak perlu menginstall dependency goose di perangkat mereka. Nantinya kita cukup berikan file binary ini beserta file migration sql nyaBerikut struktur folder sampai saat ini:Karena saya menggunakan Go Module, jadi ada tambahan file go.mod dan go.sumLalu kita compile goose.go nyago build goose.goSetelah itu, kita cek status migration dengan command./goose postgres “user=<user-anda> password=<password-anda> dbname=postgres sslmode=disable” statusApplied at masih pending, artinya kita belum menerapkan migrasi. Untuk melakukan migrasi, ketik command ini./goose postgres “user=<user-anda> password=<password-anda> dbname=postgres sslmode=disable” upHeavens’s Brisket!, table-table yang kita define berhasil di migrate. Data-data inisial untuk table role pun otomatis ter insertSummaryDi tutorial ini, kita telah belajar sedikit mengenai salah satu tool migrasi database di Golang bernama goose, kita juga sudah menggunakan 3 command dasar di goose yakni create, status dan up. Dan yang terpenting, kita telah berhasil membuat file binary yang bersifat standalone sebagai tool migrasi.Ok.

Once we resize our window below a certain point (we’ll choose less than 768px), our image will take up 100% of the window size.Let’s begin.We’ll start by updating the state and CSS styles…For the state, we’ll simply add a variable to keep track of the width of one image in our slider, but as a percentage not in pixels.For CSS, we’ll add a ‘media’ option we’ll use to set our ‘max image size’.Let’s tackle making our image slider stay proportional to the window.We’ll need to calculate what percentage of the window one image in our slider takes.After we get that, we’ll set the view-port’s and individual card’s width using it.We’ll calculate the percentage in the ‘componentWillMount()’ lifecycle function and we’ll handle updating the view-port in the ‘componentDidMount()’ function and the cards in the ‘render()’ function.Note:I’ve recalculated the amount of shift that happens when our slider initially loads.We’ll also need to copy that logic into our Next and Previous buttons…Now that we have the width in percentage, let’s update our “Card.js” component.All we have to do is take the width away from our styles object and put it in as a prop and lastly change the ‘height’ to ‘auto’.Finally, to make our image slider respond to the user resizing the window, we’ll add a ‘resize’ event listener in the ‘componentDidMount()’ function of our “HorizontalCarousel.js” and just make sure the slider remembers which image the user is on.Let’s tackle making our image slider “go full screen” when we shrink the window below a width of 768px.Firstly, we’ll give our program a choice:If the width of the window is below 768px, then we’ll set the width of our view-port and cards to 100%.If not we’ll keep it proportional to a maximum window width.Lastly, we’ll just copy the logic we just updated to the ‘resize’ event listener.If you would like a more in-depth guide, check out my full video tutorial on YouTube, An Object Is A.UPGRADE to a RESPONSIVE ReactJS Image SliderWritten byAn Object Is ALearning to code…FollowProgrammingFront End DevelopmentJavaScriptWeb DevelopmentReactjsMore from An Object Is AFollowLearning to code…More From MediumDeep dive into Scope Chains and ClosuresKevin Turney in freeCodeCamp.orgMimic Redux with React Context API and hooksSumit Joshi in The StartupReact 2020 — P1: Intro and InstallationDino Cajic in Dev GeniusCool Custom Cursors With React + Framer Motion: Part 1Levon Arakelyan in The StartupA place for every mapper!Jon RistaWhat you need to know about Sails.jsLauren Adam in Upstate InteractiveUsing DataLoader to batch API requestsColloque Tsui in The StartupProps vs State in ReactKristy Parker in The StartupAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
PHP 7.x — P34: Continue Statement,https://medium.com/dev-genius/php-7-x-p34-continue-statement-272966aaedfa?source=tag_archive---------38-----------------------,"PHP,Programming,Web Development,Software Development,Computer Science","We looked at the break statement in the previous article. As a refresher, the break statement terminates the loop once it’s encountered. Sometimes we want to just skip an iteration and continue with the loop; that can be achieved with the continue statement.Let’s look at how we can use the continue statement inside of each loop: while, do-while, for, and foreach. Each loop will iterate through the following array:In the first example, we’ll look at the while loop. PHP will iterate through the $next_car array; once it matches “R34 Skyline,” PHP will output “That’s right. I’m getting a Skyline.”As is customary in most of my articles, I like to walk through at least one example fully. I think it provides the reader with a clear-cut way of looking at the code. In this example:PHP echoes “While Loop”It initializes $i to 0.PHP encounters the while keyword.It looks at the condition $i < count($next_car). The function count($next_car) returns 5 since there are 5 elements in the array $next_car. The variable $i contains the value 0 during the first iteration. Since 0 is less than 5, the expression is evaluated to true. PHP enters the loop body.The if statement is encountered. PHP checks to make sure that the current element does not equal “R34 Skyline.” During the first iteration, $next_car[$i++] returns “Porsche 911.” As soon as that statement is processed, $i is iterated from 0 to 1 (remember how the post-increment operator works).PHP checks to see if “Porsche 911” equals “R34 Skyline.” Since it doesn’t, the statement evaluates to true due to the != operator. It’s saying, “Is it true that Porsche 911 does not equal R34 Skyline?” And PHP responds “Yes, that’s true.”Since the if statement returned true, PHP enters the if statement body and echoes out $i (this is just to show you that $i was incremented).The next statement that PHP encounters is the continue statement. The continue statement tells PHP to skip the remainder of the code that’s inside of the while loop body and go back to the top to test the while loop conditional. So, go back to step 4 and repeat.PHP will encounter the continue statement during the 2nd and the 3rd iteration.During the 4th iteration, the if statement conditional evaluates to false, therefore the if statement is skipped. PHP reaches the echo statement and outputs “That’s right. I’m getting a Skyline.” This would be a perfect place to add a break statement to exit the loop, but we’ll keep going since there could be multiple elements inside of the array that contain the value “R34 Skyline” (and because we’re not covering the break statement here).Because there are more elements in the array, and nothing was done to terminate the loop, it keeps going until it reaches the last element. Each time, the expression returns true inside of the if statement conditional and the continue statement is executed.When $i is incremented from 5 to 6, PHP evaluates the expression inside of the while loop, and it returns false. PHP exits the loop.Next, let’s look at the do-while loop. PHP evaluates the statements inside of the do-while body before it tests the do-while condition. Ultimately, the same result is produced. PHP will encounter the continue statement each time that “R34 Skyline” is not returned. Once it’s returned, PHP will output “That’s right. I’m getting a Skyline.”Let’s mix it up a little with the for loop example. We’ll add “Subaru STi” to the array, which just happens to be a car that I already own. We want to loop through the $next_car array and output the message: “The BLANK-CAR is definitely a possibility…with enough subscribers.” BLANK-CAR references each array element value. If we encounter Subaru STi, we don’t want to output anything since we already own it (or at least I already own it). So, if PHP encounters that value, it should skip over it using the continue statement.The code achieves just that. It iterates through each array element. If the value matches “Subaru STi,” the continue statement is encountered and PHP skips the remaining code inside of the loop. It goes back to the top and repeats the process. Otherwise, the continue statement is not encountered and the code below the if statement is executed.Let’s look at the last loop: the foreach loop. The foreach loop will be identical to the for loop in logic (only the syntax will differ).And that’s it. That’s how you use the continue statement inside each of the loops. The process is exactly the same for each (no pun intended) loop.dinocajic/php-7-youtube-tutorialsCode for the PHP 7.x YouTube tutorials.github.comDev GeniusCoding, Tutorials, News, UX, UI and much more related to developmentFollow15 Sign up for Best StoriesBy Dev GeniusThe best stories sent monthly to your email. Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

Давнее присутствие на рынке приложений поспособствовало тому, что к сегодняшнему дню у R Shiny сформировалось более обширное сообщество, чем у Dash. Тем не менее, благодаря экспоненциальному росту количества пользователей, привлеченных пакетами и дискуссиями, касающимися потенциальных улучшений в структуре приложения, Dash стал более распространенным в последние годы .Дополнительную информацию об общих возможностях и ​​стоимости приложений R Shiny & R Studio можно найти в разделе «Цены» и «Хостинг и развертывание» .Узнать больше о развертывании Dash можно здесь .Недостатки DashОднако одной из причин для беспокойства является то, что некоторые функции Plotly (и функции Dash) работают очень медленно. Тем не менее это легко можно обойти, если понять, что (почти) все в Plotly хранится в виде словаря. Таким образом, для вызовов функций не требуется генерировать словарь для каждого из этих вызовов, поскольку пользователь может создать его один раз и в дальнейшем передавать вызовы в качестве аргументов, что резко повышает скорость выполнения отдельных функций.Примеры панелей индикаторов с использованием Dash от Plotlyplotly/dash-recipesA collection of scripts and examples created while answering questions from the greater Dash community …github.com7 New Dash Apps Made by the Dash CommunityLet’s have a look at 7 slick Dash apps made by the Dash community.medium.comPython for Finance: Dash by PlotlyExpanding Jupyter Notebook Stock Portfolio Analyses with Interactive Charting in Dash by Plotly.towardsdatascience.comPython for Finance: Dash by PlotlyExpanding Jupyter Notebook Stock Portfolio Analyses with Interactive Charting in Dash by Plotly.towardsdatascience.comВ целом, Dash — это открытое, постоянно растущее сообщество со множеством обсуждений и пакетов, доступных для совершенствования приложения в соответствии с требованиями пользователя.

Should You opt for E-Commerce as a Supplement to Your Storefront?,https://medium.com/@shakztech/should-you-opt-for-e-commerce-as-a-supplement-to-your-storefront-44f9f30e060b?source=tag_archive---------41-----------------------,"E Commerce Solution,Web Development,E Commerce Business,Web Design Company,Web Design Services","Probably.We’re currently living in an age where 59% of the global population are active internet users. That’s a potential 4.57 billion people who could be reached. An online presence is essential for businesses who want to be accessed by the vast digital population who search for their needs online from the comfort of their homes. Statista and Chartmeter have it nailed:• 72% of people who conduct a local search will visit a store within a radius of 8 kilometres of their location• 89% of people search for a local business on their phone at least once a week• 76% of people who conduct a local mobile search visit a business within 24 hours• Online advertisement is 70% larger than TV advertising• 2.1 billion digital buyers• 3.5 billion Google searches are made every day (Internet Live Status)Not having an online presence equates to creating a wall between you and a plethora of potential clients.Having an e-commerce store is a different ball game, as 78% of local mobile searches result in a purchase either in-store or online. Having an online store allows users to buy your products or services from the comfort of their homes, meaning that even in a global pandemic like the one we’re experiencing now, you will continue to see to a growth in your sales because of the sheer volume of users spending time online.Remain Open at all Times:Let’s face it — any business owner knows that closing shop for any period of time is not ideal. An e-commerce website means that you can stay operational and bring in revenue 24/7. That means you have the power to make money while you sleep.Fewer Costs:One of the biggest benefits of having an e-commerce website is the undeniable decrease in expenses compared to running a brick-and-mortar store. Here are some cost benefits:Advertising and marketing: Promoting your products and/or services online is a lot cheaper and can be reached by a lot more people. Most businesses utilize channels like pay-per-click (PPC), search engine optimization (SEO) and social media marketing (SMM).Workforce: A lot of menial tasks previously handled by employees (for example checkout, billing, payment) can be easily automated and your workforce can be utilized for more value-adding activities.Real estate: This one’s simple- invest less on large, expensive storefronts and direct those funds towards increasing profits. With e-commerce platforms, you can do what your storefronts do and more.Provide larger amounts of information: If users are interested in your product, they will look for information about it. A website allows you to keep your customers informed more easily and provide accurate and timely information at your discretion.Locate products quicker: Automatic inventory systems mean that users will be able to see what products are available much quicker and without any assistance. Pre-ordering and bulk-buying can be done with a few clicks.Create a market for niche-products: Buyers and sellers of niche products find it incomparably easier to locate each other. Companies who operate in niche markets have an easier time finding clients and vice versa.Gather client data directly: E-commerce allows your business to track logistics which is key to a successful online business. Having a digital portal makes it easy to collect data. You will have an understanding of what’s selling and what’s not. It will be easy to understand the behaviour of your clients and this knowledge can be used to enhance your business.Inventory: You will be able to advertise goods with limited stock which translates to savings on inventory costs. Getting a good idea of what kind of products are more popular, less inventory is wasted on poor performing products and services, and profits can be achieved more effectively and efficiently.Contact with customers: E-commerce websites make it easier to keep clients in the loop with new products, offers and personalized service through email. All of this requires very little effort with the help of e-commerce infrastructure. Web tools like cookies capture data which can provide specific information about which customers to focus on.Growth and expansion: A growing business has growing needs- owners will need to consider how they will serve more customers, employ more people, rent bigger spaces, figure out logistics; all of which adds innumerable expenses that businesses might not have the capital for. E-commerce makes expansion extremely simple in comparison to physical storefronts.Personalized online experience: Companies are able to create a unique online experience for their users as well as change and update this experience on an as-need basis. Creating pages for different audiences allows the brand to create more meaningful connections with customers with much less effort, and without the need to nurture them from the first seconds they step into a physical store. Users who have visited a website before can also be retargeted by online advertising.Ease of employment: Hiring is made easier by posting jobs on e-commerce websites. The business can then focus their attention on other activities as potential employees will find them- as opposed to conducting extensive personnel searches themselves.Reputation: A unique website is a digital profile of your business and that communicated the professionality of the brand to customers. You could be providing the best product and/or services, but if the online experience is lacklustre, it could have a negative impact on your brand image. On the other hand, the good user experience will help retain customers and encourage them to continue their relationship with your brand.In summary, not having an e-commerce website limits you to the geographical area you located in. Having an e-commerce website expands your potential client-base by giving you a global reach. A company’s website is their global online persona and is essential for growing businesses thus, should be represented in the best possible way. Everything is digitalized and your growing business should be too.Web Design Company | We Design Result-Oriented Websites | DubaiResult-oriented website design company in Dubai.

What You Should Know About Voice Engine Optimization.,https://medium.com/seattle-seo/what-you-should-know-about-voice-engine-optimization-7477e7055e19?source=tag_archive---------42-----------------------,"Voe,Voice Engine Optimization,SEO,Web Development,Seo Tips","Have you ever conducted a voice search or used a voice engine before? Voice engines are devices that can listen and respond to people. They help people with questions or tasks, such as playing music or asking what time it is. So, how can VOE benefit your business?What is Voice Engine Optimization (VOE)?According to chatmeter.com, Voice engine optimization is the process of optimizing your content to become the primary answer in voice searches. Voice search refers to verbal searches made to devices that have it. Whether it be Google Home, Siri, Alexa, Cortana, or others. If your content is not optimized for voice search results, then it will not be read.The importance of ensuring your content is the best is that only one result will be read. Voice search results do not read 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place rankings. Hence why it is important to be at the top of voice search results. Whether it is a recipe, instructions, or a song the voice search device like will read out what your business has to say.Voice search operationsVoice search can help you find many things. For example, playing music on a voice search device can be easy by just asking to play a song based on name and artist. Of course, the streaming and where the content is fetched can be different based on each device. Apple devices get the music from apple music, Amazon devices get the music from amazon music. But most voice search devices allow the user to connect their music service like Spotify, Pandora, Tidal, etc.Voice devices also allow a user to keep a shopping list and link to multiple devices. For example, your Amazon account and data can be synced on multiple devices. The advantage is that you can just tell any device to set a reminder or add an item to your shopping cart.If you have voice search devices in your home/office, you can also make your environment smart. With this ability, you can change lights colors, dim lights, close/open blinds, set the temperature, turn on the tv, or have coffee ready when you get up in the morning. Other pros can include where you can tell your voice assistant to set a timer for dinner or an alarm to wake upVoice commands and searches can help you efficiently complete day to day skills like ordering from a restaurant, play a game, look for a movie, call for a taxi. Other benefits of VOE include easier access to everyday information like the weather, traffic, news.Driving can be safer with a voice assistant by your side. Voice assistants can tell you the directions of a location, answer/end calls, send text messages without reaching for a device. Have you ever lost your phone? With voice search, it is easier to find your lost phone too!How voice search worksVoice search works based on speech recognition technology, this technology recognizes sound packets that we project when we speak. If you say the word car, the software recognizes it as c-a-r (phones). The sound packets and phones or blocks of sound that all words are build from are analyzed and “understood”. When we listen, our ears catch phonemes going through the air and the brain converts it into words, sentences, ideas, thoughts. Computers, smart devices, smartphones, search software uses phonemes to recognize our voice converting it to letters, words, sentences. Real bits are analyzed and processed using algorithms, problem-solving to recognize it as a voice. There are four ways a computer approaches the conversion of spoken words to voice search:Simple matching, where a whole word is recognized, and its compared to a similar sound stored in the memory.The pattern, and feature analysis, every word is broken down into bits that recognize key features like vowels.Language modeling, and statistical analysis, grammar, certain sounds, or words combine with each other to improve accuracy and how fast a voice is recognized.Artificial neural networks; brain-like computer models, that recognize patterns of sounds and words.How to Start Voice Engine OptimizationNow that you know what voice engine optimization is and how it can affect business. How do you optimize a website and its online content for voice engines as well as traditional SEO channels?Following are some basic steps to get you started:1. Update your business listings.A business listing is a public profile that contains business information. Hence, why local SEO is paramount, the following information should be current and prominent on sites like Google My Business:The business nameA business descriptionLink to your websiteHours of operationBusiness address & phone number2. Optimize for MobileMobile devices now account for 20% of voice searches. That means it is important to focus on mobiles and not just devices like computers, laptops, and tablets. Also, ways you can optimize for mobile devices is by having a structured site. That way the website is good for both computers and mobiles. That can increase website traffic causing more sales in your business.3. Use long-tail keywords.Long-tail keywords are phrases of three words or more. Voice engines are highly specific in their word choice, so it is important to play to that. An example is instead of saying “Walmart near me,” on Google. In voice engines you would say, “where is the nearest Walmart?” this makes more sense when it comes to everyday speech as opposed to a more robotic search query. Using natural language with direct answers to specific questions is key.4. Schema markup and rich snippetsStructured data can help keep queries and answers in a context that is better understood by search engines.How do you Take Advantage of Voice Engine Optimization?Because it is important to be number one in voice search. You need to optimize your content to be the top in voice engines. There are 3 simple steps to optimize your content and utilize the best web words.Use conversational speech.When using voice engine optimization, it is important to use words that people use in everyday talk. When users use voice search, they talk to it like they are talking to a friend. Therefore, it is important to not use big words in your content and title. Make your words more conversational. These will result in the likelihood of showing up in search results.2. Provide some answers.When someone asks a question on the internet, they want a quick answer. One way to optimize your content in search results is to answer questions. The content should be structured in such a way that short and in-depth answers are available. Voice engines are used primarily to answer questions. So, answering common and complex questions will help optimize your content and business.3. Test it.In order to make sure your content is optimized for searches is to test it. See if it works. You can get into the mind of the reader. See what they search for, how they search for it, and the words they use. Then implement your strategy.A great way to test voice queries is to actually try it on Google. Click on the mic, and ask!Benefits of Voice Engine OptimizationIt is fast.Because voice engines use voice instead of words on screen or text, it is faster. Think about how long it takes to write a sentence. And how long it takes to say that same sentence. The speech will most likely be faster. That is good for the consumer because they can get answers, they want quicker. In fact, with can be the difference in whether they want to buy a product you sell or not.2. It allows you to multitask.Voice engine optimization allows you to multitask. For example when you are cooking and need to check a recipe, but your hands are covered in flour, it's only going to be easier to ask Google. The benefit, of not having to wash your hands so that you can touch your phone. Another example is if you have an iPhone you can use the “hey Siri” feature. Say “Hey Siri” and ask for the recipe. Once again not having to type your search query.3. It saves money.A well-optimized website through brilliant and effective online marketing will save you money in terms of little or no online advertising.Negatives of Voice Engine OptimizationNo guarantee.Just like all businesses, there is no guarantee of success. You can do all of the work in order to optimize your content to come up in voice searches. You can make your website faster, use conversational speech, and more. But that does not mean you will come up in voice searches. Other companies and businesses could take hold of the number one spot. That is the reality of business. But, being aggressive and staying on task will help your business keep that number on spot.2. Still in Development.Because voice engine optimization is still relatively new, it still has some way to go. Though new features are released, it will be a while until search results through voice are more natural as compared to today. In fact, sometimes your content could be too confusing or complicated for the VOE technologies to understand.3. Lack of privacy.For voice searches, privacy is a problem with some consumers. They might not want to have a device capable of listening in on them. Products like Alexa are capable of listening to consumers all the time. In fact, 41% of users have privacy concerns with voice assistants. That could be a problem for your business because not all potential customers may not use or have a voice assistant.For example, a woman in Portland, OR was on a private conversation that was recorded by an Amazon Echo. According to kiro7.com, every room in her family home was wired with the Amazon devices to control her home’s heat, lights, and security system. Danielle, the woman who was recorded, said her husband’s employee called them telling her to unplug her Echo device. She unplugged all of the devices. They later received audio files that recorded her conversion with her husband. Someone from 176 miles away was listening to them.She said, “I’m never plugging in that device again because I can’t trust it.”Shelby Lichliter, an Amazon spokeswoman, sent a statement to Kiro 7. She explained how the Echo woke up due to a word in the conversation sounding like “Alexa.” And recorded the couple because the Echo heard the words “send a message.” An unlikely string of events caused the whole situation to unfold. It was an extremely rare occurrence that does not usually happen.Danielle had a private conversation recorded by an Amazon Echo. That is not something anyone wants to deal with or go through. But at the same time, technology is not perfect. So, cases like this are bound to happen. It makes the consumers think if getting a voice assistant that listens to you is worth it?How voice search is changing SEOVoice search is changing how SEO works. When people voice search they tend to go into detail to get the right answer. An average voice search queries consist of twenty-nine words. Hence, why content on websites needs to be written so it can be easily spoken by smartphones. Meaning that content needs to be short, clean to be easily searched by, and answers heard. So changing the way content is written for a website needs to be written to what people say/ask not searched/typed.With a lot of people owning smartphone devices, people are searching for local places. Concentrating on what people are searching for locally is something many SEO experts include as part of their online marketing strategies.Voice searching is being used for micro-moments. Micro-moments is when a user uses a voice assistant to search and while making a decision about something. Again making it about what people are searching about locally; purchasing an item, visit a store.Voice search statisticsAccording to Google, about 27 percent of all searches are voice searches. Currently, the most popular use of a smart speaker is playing music. By 2022 global voice commerce is expected to reach 40 billion dollars. Apple’s SIRI leads the smartphone voice assistant market share with 48.4 percent. Google assistant has a 28.7 percent market share and Alexa has 10 percent. Voice search queries are longer than regular text-based searches. 40 percent of adults with a smartphone use voice search at least once a day and 20 percent of adults use voice search at least once a month. 55 percent of teenagers use voice search on a daily basis. Parents that own voice-activated speakers, 72 percent have considered shopping online with their devices.How to better boost for voice searchYou can optimize for voice search by writing your content naturally and in a conversational tone since people are going to be asking questions using their voice. Focus on not using keywords in your content, focus on providing more helpful answers for users. Since people ask longer questions when using voice search, focus on long-tail keyword phrases to reach more users. Building a mobile responsive website can be a good way to reach users because so many people are using their smartphones daily. Try to answer questions with as little words as possible, 29 words or less.Voice search and smart homes are the future. The US, houses will increase when it comes to smart homes.Future of Voice Engine OptimizationVoice Engines are just starting to become popular. Smart speakers like Google Home and Alexa are becoming more popular. According to statstica.com, Google Home unit sales were 12.5 million worldwide in 2018. In 2025 it is expected to be 140 million-unit sales worldwide. This number alone justifies why small businesses should start to place more emphasis on voice engine optimization.Some FactsVoice Engine Optimization: Common Questions and AnswersWhat is the difference between voice engine optimization and search engine optimization?Search engine optimization is how you optimize your content for searches on via text entry whereas VEO is geared towards voice search and results.When were voice engines made?Voice engine systems originated in the late 1950s. Voice engines were created by Noriko Umeda in 1968. It was developed in an Electrotechnical laboratory in Japan at the time.Takeaway on Voice Engine Optimization.Now that you know what voice engine optimization you may have gathered the importance of it and be prepared as its momentum picks. To be competitive you should use multiple avenues for online presence, and VEO being one of them. By taking one step towards effective SEO you will see that over time it will be advantageous to your business.Seattle SEOSeattle SEO CompaniesFollowVoeVoice Engine OptimizationSEOWeb DevelopmentSeo TipsWritten byVisualwebzFollowVisualwebz LLC is a Seattle web design and online marketing agency serving small businesses.FollowSeattle SEOFollowA list of SEO companies and strategiesFollowWritten byVisualwebzFollowVisualwebz LLC is a Seattle web design and online marketing agency serving small businesses.Seattle SEOFollowA list of SEO companies and strategiesMore From MediumFive Economical Ways to Supercharge B2B Marketing and SalesSpringboard Enterprises in Been There Run ThatHow To Use Social Networks For Real Estate?Aashish Sharma in EntrepreneuryorkThe Marriage of Great Content and Great DesignJoe DudeckHow the power of priming can transform your brand experienceJennifer Clinehens in Choice HackingThe Complete Guide to Optimizing Your LinkedIn ProfileReuben Salsa in Better MarketingPersonal Branding is ScaryJimmy CandouThe Last Buyer Persona Article You Will Need to ReadRon Jaradat in The StartupHumans Are Not Brands or ProductsKitty Hannah EdenLearn more.Medium is an open platform where 170 million readers come to find insightful and dynamic thinking."

Simple custom Vue.js form validation,https://medium.com/@rowland.emil/simple-custom-vue-js-form-validation-7dc5bd9e3c5e?source=tag_archive---------44-----------------------,"Vuejs,Vue,Code,Web Development,JavaScript","This will show you a simple real-time form validation in Vue.js with help of computed properties.For simplicity I will use the bootstrap-vue framework for the form. But this work’s without any external dependencies.The example above disables the submit button and shows the text “Invalid data” until the form is valid. The validation part is handled by a computed property in Vue. In the computed property you can specify all your requirements as a boolean equation, ex. input1 needs to be above 0 and input2 can’t be empty. Thanks of the mechanics of computed properties it will update in real-time if any of the inputs are updated.If you want to have some individual input field messages you can add that as well by separating each field to its separate computed property. These can then be aggregated together to one final property like our dataValid.What I want to show with this is if you only need a simple real-time form validation without individual input field messages, you don’t need to use complex libraries.Written byemil rowlandFollowVuejsVueCodeWeb DevelopmentJavaScriptMore from emil rowlandFollowMore From MediumWeird parts in JavaScript — part 1Alen Vlahovljak in The StartupAn Introduction to Web WorkersJohn Au-Yeung in Better ProgrammingWorking With Regular Expressions (RegEx) in JavaScriptAquil Hussain in Better ProgrammingGuide to Angular unit testingArmen Vardanyan in The StartupCompiling vs. Polyfilling in JavaScriptDr. Derek Austin 🥳 in Better ProgrammingHow to Integrate Card Payment with Stripe into Your Web App without Back-endYingying Fu in JavaScript In Plain EnglishOutside main thread, heavy task calculations in Vue.Adam OrłowskiBeginner’s working guide to JavaScript generatorsFabian TerhAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

Var vs Let vs Const in javascript,https://medium.com/@sruthiragupathy/var-vs-let-vs-const-in-javascript-3ffa9cd4aa72?source=tag_archive---------47-----------------------,"Technology,JavaScript,Web Development,Developer,Keywords","Var vs Let vs Const in Javascript#javascript #keywordsBefore speaking about the keywords var,let and const, I believe it is extremely important to understand the concept of scope.Global ScopeVariables declared outside any function (globally) have global scopeHere, the variable global can be accessed from anywhere.Function ScopeVariables that are declared inside a function (locally) have function scopeHere, the variable local can be accessed only inside the function.Block ScopeSome variables can be accessed only within block i.e.,within {}Here , the variable block can be accessed only within the if block. It cannot be accessed from anywhere else. Thus, the variable block has only block scope.Now that we are clear with the scope, let’s dive into the var,let and const keywordsvarScopeThe variables defined with the keyword var have function scope.If it is defined outside the function , then the scope of the variable is global.Here, the variable foo defined with the keyword var can be accessed from anywhere while the variable bar is limited to the function scope.Redeclaration and ReAssignmentThe variables declared with the keyword var can be redeclared and reassigned.HoistingHoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.Variables declared with var keyword are hoisted at the top of its scope and is initialized with undefined.Here, the variable foo is declared later.But it is hoisted at the top and initialized to undefined.letScopeThe variables declared with the keyword let have block scope.Here, the variable i can be accessed only within the for loop.Redeclaration and ReAssignmentVariables declared with let keyword cannot be redeclared, but it can be reassigned.HoistingVariables declared with let are also hoisted at the top, but let variables are not initialized until their definition is evaluated.This is because of Temporal Dead ZoneThus,trying to access the variable foo before declaration gives reference error.constScopeThe variables declared with the const keyword also have block scope.Redeclaration and ReassignmentVariables declared with const keyword must be initialized at the time of its declaration itself.Otherwise an error is thrown.Variables declared with const keyword cannot be redeclared and reassigned.Attempting to overwrite objects with const keyword throws error. But object keys are not protected and they are mutable.Here, we can see that the object cannot be reassigned, but the keys of the object are mutable.Similarly arrays declared with const keyword cannot be overwritten. But the elements in the array is mutable.HoistingVariables declared with const keyword behaves the same way as let keyword.They are hoisted at the top of the scope but they are not initialized until their definition is evaluatedvar vs let vs const — A SummaryvarletconstScopeFunction or GlobalBlockBlockRedeclareYesNoNoReassignYesYesNoHoistedYesNoNoWritten bysruthi ragupathyFollowTechnologyJavaScriptWeb DevelopmentDeveloperKeywordsMore from sruthi ragupathyFollowMore From MediumHow To Avoid Prop Drilling in React Using Component CompositionOlusola Samuel in JavaScript In Plain English3 Angular Dependency Injection TipsJoe Eames in Thinkster.ioHacking my Honeymoon with Javascript 🦒Alec Brunelle in JavaScript In Plain English50 Things I Wish I Learned Earlier as a DeveloperPiero Borrelli in JavaScript In Plain EnglishHow to publish packages that can be used in browsers and NodeZell Liew in freeCodeCamp.orgStreams, Piping, and Their Error Handling in Node.jsKunal Tandon in Developer’s ArenaNode.js Tips — Closing Sockets, Writing Responses, and Parsing HTMLJohn Au-Yeung in JavaScript In Plain English6 Pure Angular  Pipes for Human-Readable UILewis Fairweather in JavaScript In Plain EnglishAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

In this case, we’ll use the onclick method that we add to the button.We can specify what element should be selected, by adding the “id” param to the function, and we’ll be able to specify the class name that should be added to the element.Take a look at the code example that I’ve created for you.We have here element with id “hero” and button that can fire the “addClass” function with the “onclick” attribute.Next, we have a js script where we specified function named “addClass” that can take “id”, and “className” as params.Inside the function, we iterate DOM to find an element with the id that we passed in button and add a class attribute with a class name that we added when fire “addClass” function.<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=""en"">  <head>    <meta charset=""UTF-8"">    <meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"">    <title>Learn coding on Duomly.com</title>  </head>  <body>    <div id=""hero"">      This is hero element    </div>    <button onclick=""addClass('hero', 'rounded')"">Add class</button>    <script>      function addClass(id, className) {        const element = document.getElementById(id);        element.setAttribute(""class"", className);      }    </script>  </body></html>Duomly — Programming Online CoursesThank you for reading,Radek from DuomlyDuomly - Programming courses onlinewww.duomly.comFollow5 CSSJavaScriptCodingProgrammingWeb Development5 claps5 clapsWritten byRadoslaw FabisiakFollowCore developer in www.duomly.com - Programming online coursesFollowDuomly - Programming courses onlineFollowwww.duomly.com - We believe everyone can learn how to code, so we are making learning fun and easy!FollowWritten byRadoslaw FabisiakFollowCore developer in www.duomly.com - Programming online coursesDuomly - Programming courses onlineFollowwww.duomly.com - We believe everyone can learn how to code, so we are making learning fun and easy!More From MediumInteracting With RESTful API’s Using TypeScript, React hooks, and Axios.

It’s the fact that I’m walking.”― Craig D. LounsbroughIt’s day 3 and the #100daysofcode challenge is going really well. Despite coding, not more than 2 hours the day before due to my other engagement where I need to be present for around 10 hours workshop on UHV where I am a technical coordinator. Tomorrow is the last day for the workshop, I hope to dedicate more time for coding.I learned about a function that takes an object as an input and returns an object too. As I progress further objects are becoming my favorite part of javascript. I believe objects are capable of doing much more than I have used it until now.I’m getting more and more comfortable in using a function in my code day by day. When I first read about the forEach loop, it was difficult for me to understand call back function but gradually with time, getting better at it.Apart from a function that takes an object as an input and returns an object too, I built a simple Todo application, which I can run in the console, helping in practice, pervious concept altogether in one place. A very new concept I also learned yesterday was for in and for of in Javascript, it was not familiar to me as I never heard it in other programming languages like Java and C++. But the whole point to the day was learning and exploring new things.That’s was my day 3 of code.with love,InderConnect with me on Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, youtube.(I share daily tips and tricks on Web development there).Written byInderjeet BhagatJourney of an unfocussed, Impaitent, procastinator, ugly guy to a guy who is determined to change his life.FollowCodingCodersJavaScript100daysofcodeWeb DevelopmentMore from Inderjeet BhagatFollowJourney of an unfocussed, Impaitent, procastinator, ugly guy to a guy who is determined to change his life.More From MediumGoogle Apps Script: AQI Slack botChristopher Holmes in Christopher HolmesBuilding Complex Web App Which Is Data and Assets Heavy Using GraphQl+NodeJs+MongoDb (Backend)Archit Singh in The StartupUpSet.js —JavaScript TutorialSamuel GratzlAdd Eslint Support to your React Native Project with React HooksChamika Kasun in The StartupVue + Vuex Store — Short Tutorial for BeginnersMac LisowskiVerifying JSON Web Tokens with Express-JWTJohn Au-Yeung in JavaScript In Plain EnglishReact Faster Performance: Highlight React Components UpdatesChidume Nnamdi 🔥💻🎵🎮 in Dev ProtohitJavascript PromisesMustaAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

How to Build Elixir Blog App With Phoenix in Less Than 15min,https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-build-elixir-blog-app-with-phoenix-in-less-than-15min-815366590e85?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Phoenix Framework,Elixir,Programming,Web Development","Okay, let’s get real for a second. No-one can actually build a production-ready blog application from scratch in less than 15 minutes. That’s not how the world works. However, creating a working prototype — that’s totally possible.So here is the plan — we are gonna spend the next 15min or so building a prototype of a blog application that meets the following criteria:User can create, update, display and delete postsUser can add comments to a postUser can see all the comments for a particular postUser can see how many comments does each post haveA small side note — this blog post is inspired by an article I read a couple of days back — “Elixir Blog in 15 Minutes Using Phoenix Framework — Step By Step Tutorial” written by Jakub Cieślar. Since the article was published way back in 2015, I felt it will be nice to get an updated version that properly reflects the current state of Elixir and Phoenix.STEP 0: PrerequisitesThe Phoenix Framework has a fantastic set of installation docs. I suggest you follow these and you’ll be set up and ready to go in no time.Another small side note — if you are planning to explore and work with different versions of Elixir in the future, you might want to install Elixir (and Erlang) via asdf.STEP 1: Create the blog applicationFirst of all, meet your new best friend — Mix. This is an Elixir build tool that provides a basic set of tasks to help create and manage Elixir apps.To create a new application from scratch, all you need to do is open a new terminal window and enter the following command:mix phx.new blogHalfway through the installation process you will be asked if you want to fetch and install the project dependancies — I suggest you go ahead and do so.* creating blog/config/config.exs* creating blog/config/dev.exs* creating blog/config/prod.exs...* creating blog/assets/css/phoenix.css* creating blog/assets/static/images/phoenix.png* creating blog/assets/static/robots.txtFetch and install dependencies? [Yn]If you choose not to install the dependancies, you must make sure to run the below mentioned mix tasks in order to complete your setup process. Otherwise, you won’t be able to start your application.* running mix deps.get* running mix deps.compile* running cd assets && npm install && node node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js --mode developmentAnd that’s it — you now have a working application. Well… not just yet. There are still a couple of extra things you need to take care of first.Check the dev.ex and test.ex files that have been created under the config folder of your project. Make sure that the database username and password match the ones you have setup on your local machine.config :blog, Blog.Repo,  username: ""postgres"",  password: ""postgres"",  database: ""blog_dev"",  hostname: ""localhost"",  show_sensitive_data_on_connection_error: true,  pool_size: 10You need to create the database of your application$ mix ecto.create                                                                                                               The database for Blog.Repo has been createdAnd now it’s done. You can go ahead and start the server using the following command:$ mix phx.serverBy default your app will be running on http://localhost:4000STEP 2: Setting up the Post resourcePhoenix provides us out of the box with a neat set of generators — mix tasks that are responsible for setting up all the modules we need to spin up a resource in a fast and efficient manner.To create a new Post resource we are gonna use phx.gen.html — it will generate the controller, views and context for us.mix phx.gen.html Posts Post posts title:string body:textBasically, we just told mix that we want to create a new resource named Post that has context Posts and a database table posts that has two fields — title of type string and body of type text.Next, we need to go to the Blog.Router module and add the route definitions for our new resource:resources ""/posts"", PostControllerAdding the new Post resource has generated a new database migration. To persist the changes in the database, we must run the following command:$ mix ecto.migrateNow we can start the server via mix phx.server and see the new changes by hitting the http://localhost:4000/posts route.STEP 3: Adding Comments to a PostTo create a new Comment resource we are gonna use phx.gen.context — another phoenix generator that will help us to setup a context with some functions around an ecto schema.mix phx.gen.context Comments Comment comments name:string content:text post_id:references:postsA closer look at the command above tells us that we have used the generator to define the relationship between Post and Comment by adding the post_id field to the comments table.However, we still need to manually define the association between the two schemas. To do that we will use the functions — belongs_to and has_many.If you want to know more about them, you can check the Ecto.Schema docs.A small side note — all of the code samples in this blog post are using aliases to substitute the full module names. That’s why writing belongs_to(:post, Post) is equal to belongs_to(:post, Blog.Posts.Post)defmodule Blog.Comments.Comment do  use Ecto.Schema  import Ecto.Changeset  alias Blog.Posts.Post  schema ""comments"" do    field :content, :string    field :name, :string    belongs_to(:post, Post)    timestamps()  end  @doc false  def changeset(comment, attrs) do    comment    |> cast(attrs, [:name, :content, :post_id])    |> validate_required([:name, :content, :post_id])  endenddefmodule Blog.Posts.Post do  use Ecto.Schema  import Ecto.Changeset    alias Blog.Comments.Comment  schema ""posts"" do    field :body, :string    field :title, :string    has_many :comments, Comment       timestamps()  end  @doc false  def changeset(post, attrs) do    post    |> cast(attrs, [:title, :body])    |> validate_required([:title, :body])  endendAfter making the above changes, don’t forget to run mix ecto.migrate ;)Having properly set up our schema associations, we turn our attention to completing the task at hand — we want to enable a user to add a comment to a blog post from the UI.First, we are gonna add a new route to our Blog.Router module:resources ""/posts"", PostController do  post ""/comment"", PostController, :add_commentendNext, we are gonna add the add_comment action to our post_controller.ex It will create a new comment in the database and associate it to a post.In addition, it will load the post page and display the status of the create operation in a flash message.def add_comment(conn, %{""comment"" => comment_params, ""post_id"" => post_id}) do  post =     post_id    |> Posts.get_post!()     |> Repo.preload([:comments])  case Posts.add_comment(post_id, comment_params) do    {:ok, _comment} ->      conn      |> put_flash(:info, ""Comment added :)"")      |> redirect(to: Routes.post_path(conn, :show, post))    {:error, _error} ->      conn      |> put_flash(:error, ""Comment not added :("")      |> redirect(to: Routes.post_path(conn, :show, post))  endendPersonally, I am not a fan of big controller modules. That’s why I have chosen to put the add_comment function as part of Blog.Posts context module.def add_comment(post_id, comment_params) do  comment_params  |> Map.put(""post_id"", post_id)  |> Comments.create_comment()endNext, we are going to implement a simple Add Comment form and add it to the page that displays a single post. For that to happen, we need to modify the show action in the post controller. We are going to add the Comment.changeset and pass it to the show.html template.def show(conn, %{""id"" => id}) do  post =     id    |> Posts.get_post!     |> Repo.preload([:comments])  changeset = Comment.changeset(%Comment{}, %{})  render(conn, ""show.html"", post: post, changeset: changeset)endAfter that we are going to create a new comment_form.html template that will be used to enter and save comment data.<%= form_for @changeset, @action, fn f -> %>  <div class=""form-group"">   <label>Name</label>   <%= text_input f, :name, class: ""form-control"" %>  </div>  <div class=""form-group"">    <label>Content</label>    <%= textarea f, :content, class: ""form-control"" %>  </div>    <div class=""form-group"">    <%= submit ""Add comment"", class: ""btn btn-primary"" %>  </div><% end %>Lastly, we need to add the comments_form.html template to the show.html and make sure to pass it the correct data:<%= render ""comments_form.html"", post: @post, changeset: @changeset, action: Routes.post_post_path(@conn, :add_comment, @post) %>http://localhost:4000/posts/<post_id>STEP 4: Displaying all comments for a given postTo display all the comments of a blog post we will create a new template — comments.html<h3>Comments:</h3><div class=""comments"">  <div class=""comment header"">    <div>Name</div>    <div>Content</div>  </div><%= for comment <- @comments do %>    <div class=""comment"">      <div><%= comment.name %></div>      <div><%= comment.content%></div>    </div>  <% end %></div>We can pretty up the template by adding some css styles. These can be inserted into the main app.scss file..comments {  padding-bottom: 2em;}.comment {  display: grid;  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;  padding: 0.5em;  border-bottom: 1px solid lightgrey;}.comment.header {  font-weight: bold;}Lastly, we need to insert the comments.html template into the show.html and make sure to pass it the correct data.<%= render “comments.html”, comments: @post.comments %>http://localhost:4000/post/<post_id>STEP 5: Displaying number of comments per postWe can write a simple function to calculate the number of comments associated with a post and add it to the Blog.Posts context.def get_number_of_comments(post_id) do  post = Posts.get_post!(post_id) |> Repo.preload([:comments])  Enum.count(post.comments)endNext we can call that function from the BlogWeb.PostView module in the following manner:defmodule BlogWeb.PostView do  use BlogWeb, :view  alias Blog.Posts  def get_comments_count(post_id) do            Posts.get_number_of_comments(post_id)  endendLastly we can extend the index.html template by adding a couple of lines of code that will help us to display the number of comments.<th># of Comments</th>...<td><%= get_comments_count(post.id) %></td>http://localhost:4000/postsAnd… that’s about it. Our blog application prototype is now complete.You can find the source code of the project in the following Github repository.The StartupMedium's largest active publication, followed by +723K people.

Papa Parse: Lightning Fast CSV Parsing Experience,https://codeburst.io/papa-parse-lightning-fast-csv-parsing-experience-5ee41cb5f4cf?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"JavaScript,Web Development,Software Development,NPM,Review","Photo by Marc Sendra Martorell on UnsplashOverviewWith a plethora of options to parse CSV files/data and adding to it the inconsistency of the data present in the files, have you ever wondered about a simple and efficient package to do it for you? Presenting Papa Parse, a robust JavaScript library that is claimed to be the fastest in-browser CSV parser! This is your one-stop-shop for parsing CSV to JSON!HighlightsBefore getting into the features of Papa Parse, let’s look at how we can include this package in our code:/* babel or ES6 */import papaparse from ‘papaparse’;/* node or require js */const papaparse = require(‘papaparse’);The general syntax of useFor a CSV string:var parsedOutput = Papa.parse(stringOfCsv[, config])There are numerous configurations to choose from, best explained in the Papa Parse documentation here.For a file:Papa.parse(myFileInput.files[0], {	complete: function(parsedOutput) {		console.log(parsedOutput);	}});As the portion of file parsing is an asynchronous activity, a call back must be added to collect the results.The same is the case when we want to fetch the CSV file from a URL:Papa.parse(csvUrl, {	download: true,	complete: function(parsedOutput) {		console.log(parsedOutput);	}});The parsed output/result consists of three parts — data array, errors array and the meta object. The data array has the result of the CSV rows parsed.The data is an array only when the value is header: false in configs. If the config is header: true, then the output data is a set of objects keyed by the column field names.The errors array contains the information on any errors which are encountered while parsing the CSV. The meta object is an object consisting of metadata related to the parsing such as delimiters, line break sequences, and field names to name a few.Auto delimiter detectionThere are many scenarios in which you wouldn’t be sure of the delimiter used in the CSV. Not to worry! Papa Parse has an auto delimiter detection feature in which the first few rows of the CSV are scanned to automatically figure out the delimiter used in the CSV file.The delimiter which was considered for parsing can always be checked in the result output’s meta object under the delimiter field.var output = Papa.parse(stringOfCsv); // input: a,b,c,d,econsole.log(output.meta.delimiter); // delimiter: ,If you don’t want to have auto-detection of delimiters but want to provide a range of delimiters to guess from while parsing the CSV, there’s a config option called delimitersToGuess which takes in a list of delimiters provided as input. The default value for delimitersToGuess is -delimitersToGuess : [',', '\t', '|', ';', Papa.RECORD_SEP, Papa.UNIT_SEP]Where Papa.RECORD_SEP and Papa.UNIT_SEP are read-only properties used to represent the ASCII Code 30 and ASCII Code 31 respectively as delimiters.Ability to parse huge file inputsIf the input file is really huge, then Papa Parse has the ability to stream the input data and provide the output row-by-row. Doing this will avoid loading the whole file into memory which might otherwise crash the browser. The step function should be provided as a config which collects the result for each row.Papa.parse(""http://csvexample.com/enormous.csv"", {	download: true,	step: function(row, parser) {		console.log(""Row:"", row.data);	},	complete: function() {		console.log(""All done!"");	}});The second input to the step function is parser. The parser object can be used to abort, pause, or resume the CSV parsing.parser.abort();parser.pause();parser.resume();Do not use parser.pause() and parser.resume() while using Web Workers in your CSV parsing as the threads can get held up waiting for the continue signal from the main thread making the whole UX sluggish. More on that here.Multithreading option in Papa ParseIf you are worried that your webpage will become unresponsive because of a CSV parsing script running for a long time on the main/UI thread, Papa Parse provides a configuration called worker which when set to true will ensure that a worker thread is used for the parsing of the CSV. Adding a worker thread might result in the parsing operation to slow down a little bit but will ensure that your website will remain responsive.Papa.parse(""http://csvexample.com/enormous.csv"",  {	worker: true,	step: function(row) {		console.log(""Row:"", row.data);	},	complete: function() {		console.log(""All done!"");	}});The worker thread is an extension of the default Worker interface provided by javascript.Comments in your CSV?However bizarre it sounds, if there are comments in your CSV which you would not want to parse, you can add the config provided by Papa Parse called comments and set it to a value that represents the comments’ format.Papa.parse(""http://csvexample.com/csv.csv”,  {        comments: “#”, // All lines starting with ‘#’ are treated as comments and ignored by the parser.	complete: function(parsedOutput) {		console.log(parsedOutput);	}});Type Conversion in Papa ParseBy default, all lines and fields are parsed as strings. But if you want to preserve the numeric and boolean types, Papa Parse provides an option called dynamicTyping to automatically enable the type conversion for your data.Papa.parse(""http://csvexample.com/csv.csv”,  {        dynamicTyping: true,	complete: function(parsedOutput) {		console.log(parsedOutput);	}});If true, numeric and boolean data in the string will be converted to their respective types. Numeric data must conform to the definition of a decimal literal. Numerical values greater than 2⁵³ or less than -2⁵³ will not be converted to numbers to preserve precision. European-formatted numbers must have commas and dots swapped. It also accepts an object or a function. In the case of an object, its values should be a boolean to indicate if dynamic typing should be applied for each column number (or header name if using headers). If it’s a function, it should return a boolean value for each field number (or name if using headers) which will be passed as the first argument.Converting JSON to CSV formatAnother wonderful feature of Papa Parse is its ability to convert JSON to CSV. All this while, you would have come across the parse() function. But for this feature, Papa Parse provides the unparse() option.The output of the unparse() is a neatly formatted string of CSV. The general syntax is -Papa.unparse(data[, config])The data field can be an array of objects, an array of arrays or an object with header fields and data. The optional config for unparse(), much like the one for the parse() function has a wide range of options to choose from. You can check them out here.Error HandlingThe last feature we will be discussing in this article is about the error handling by Papa Parse.As mentioned at the top of the article, the parsed results consist of three components: data, errors and meta.The errors array is structured in the following way:{	type: """",     // A generalization of the error	code: """",     // Standardized error code	message: """",  // Human-readable details	row: 0,       // Row index of parsed data where error is}One way of extracting the errors:var results = Papa.parse(csvString);console.log(results.errors.<key_type>);Even if you do encounter errors while parsing, that’s no indication that the parsing of the CSV file failed.A few useful configs for parsingSome notable configs of Papa Parse for parsing which we will just mention here are:newline - The newline sequencequoteChar - The character used to quote fieldsescapeChar - The character used to escape the quote character within a fieldpreview - If > 0, only that many rows will be parsedtransformHeader - A function to apply on each header. Requires header:truechunk - A callback function, identical to step, which activates streamingAnd many more :)Bonus Utility FunctionsBelow are some React and Angular implementations for using Papa Parse to parse CSV data:React Hookfunction useGoogleSheetData(url) {  const [rows, setRows] = useState([]);  useEffect(() => {    Papa.parse(url, {          download: true,          header: true,          complete: function(results) {            setRows(results.data);          }  }, [url]);  return rows;}and we would use it as:const rows = useGoogleSheetData(""<my_csv_url>"");Angular ObservableuseGoogleSheetData = (url: string): Observable<any> => {    return new Observable((observer) => {      parse(url, {        download: true,        header: true,        complete: (result) => {          observer.next(result);          observer.complete();        },        error: (error) => {           observer.error(error);          observer.complete();        }      })    });};Can be used as below:this.useGoogleSheetData(""<my_csv_url>"").pipe(catchError((error) => {    console.error(error);    })).subscribe((data) => {      this.sheetData = data;    });}Evaluation MetricsConclusionLooking at the features described above for Papa Parse, and many more it has to offer (you can check them out here), it is beyond any doubt that this package is the real deal. The ability of Papa Parse to handle huge files and unstructured data and its support for taking in readable streams as input(used in node.js) is what makes it stand out from the rest of the CSV parsing packages.Hope you’ve got a good insight into what Papa Parse is all about and how you can use it for your future projects :-)Check out the package and some reading materialshttps://www.npmjs.com/package/papaparsehttps://www.papaparse.com/Video review of the packageVideo review of the package with interesting use cases and in-depth exploration of the features coming soon!

Recursive Functions,https://medium.com/better-programming/recursive-functions-2b5ce4610c81?source=tag_archive---------2-----------------------,"JavaScript,Coding,Programming,Web Development,Algorithms","Photo by Noah Windler on UnsplashRecursion is an important concept in computer science. It is a programming technique that involves a function repeatedly calling itself until it reaches a solution. A recursive function, then, is a function that calls itself.A recursive function involves a recursive call and a base case. A recursive call is the part of the function body that calls itself until a specified condition is met, while the base case is the function’s stopping point. It is important that we have a base case because without it, we would be stuck in an infinite loop. The Educative diagram below is helpful in understanding the flow of a recursive function:Credit: EducativeLet’s take a look at an example of a recursive function to illustrate the concept:function printString(myString) {   console.log(myString[0]);   if (myString.length > 1) {      let mySubString = myString.substring(1, myString.length);                 printString(mySubString); // recursive call   } else {      return true; // base case   }}In the above example, we are using recursion to print out each character of a string by first printing out the first character of the string. If the string is more than one character long, we then take a substring of the original string and make a recursive call, repeating this process until the length of our string is only one character — this is our base case, upon which we will exit the recursive function.In a JavaScript recursive function, the function is repeatedly called until it hits the base case. Only when the base case is reached and provides a solution can the recursive calls be evaluated.Why do we care about recursion? While recursion is not an appropriate method for every case, it is an important concept to understand. Programming involves recursive thinking, and it can help us to write shorter and more efficient code when used appropriately.While iterative functions can usually do the same job, recursive functions are simpler to read and understand. Recursive functions are especially powerful in traversing tree structures. Another reason that recursion is important to understand is that many algorithms use recursion. One downside to recursive functions, however, is that they usually require more memory space and tend to be slower than iterative functions.This diagram explains the difference between iterative and recursive functions. Credit: freeCodeCampStrings and arrays are two data structures that especially lend themselves to recursive solutions. We can think of strings as data structures that are composed of smaller, overlapping substrings. Similarly, we can think of the properties of an array as a series of sub-arrays.A good way of finding a recursive solution to a problem is to apply the following steps:1. Choose a specific example to illustrate the concept of the problem.2. Come up with a function that provides a solution to the specific example.3. Reframe the solution so that recursion is applied. Reword the function so that it invokes itself within the function body.While the concept of a recursive function can initially be difficult to grasp, the more we practice it, the clearer it becomes.Better ProgrammingAdvice for programmers.Follow77 JavaScriptCodingProgrammingWeb DevelopmentAlgorithms77 claps77 clapsWritten byCindy KeiFollowFullstack Software Engineer based in NYC.

"JavaScript Tips — Disabling Divs, Dynamic Script Elements, and More",https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/javascript-tips-disabling-divs-dynamic-script-elements-and-more-af9dcbf18ffb?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Mike Benna on UnsplashLike any kind of apps, there are difficult issues to solve when we write JavaScript apps.In this article, we’ll look at some solutions to common JavaScript problems.How to Disable all div ContentWe can use the pointer-events: none style to disable mouse interaction on a div element.Therefore, we can write the following code to disable interaction on a div with JavaScript:$(""div"").addClass(""disabled"");Then the disabled class would have the following styles:.disabled {  pointer-events: none;  opacity: 0.5;}We disable mouse interaction and also make the div content translucent.Reject the Promise with the async-await syntaxIf we want to reject the promise returned by an async function, we can throw an error or use Promise.reject .For instance, we can write:const asyncFn = async () => {  try {    const val = await foo();    //...  }  catch(error) {    throw new Error('error');  }}Then the returned promise is rejected with the reason 'error' .Likewise, we can use Promise.reject by writing:const asyncFn = async () => {  try {    const val = await foo();    //...  }  catch(error) {    return Promise.reject(new Error('error'));  }}In the catch block we return a promise that’s rejected with the Promise.reject method.We still pass in the Error instance with the reason 'error' .Calculate Yesterday’s Date in JavaScriptWe can calculate yesterday’s date with the getDate method to return the day of the monthThen we subtract 1 from it and pass it into the setDate method.To do that, we write:const date = new Date();date.setDate(date.getDate() - 1);Append <script> ElementTo append a script element dynamically to the DOM, we can call createElement to create an element.Then we can call appendChild to append the newly created script element.For example, we can write:const script = document.createElement(""script"");script.type = ""text/javascript""; script.text = ""console.log('hello');""document.body.appendChild(script);We created a script with inline code.Then we called appendChild to append the script.Also, we can write the following to append a linked script:const script = document.createElement(""script"");script.type = ""text/javascript""; script.src   = ""/script.js"";document.body.appendChild(script);We append script.js to set the path of the script.Everything else is the same.Get the Coordinates of a Mouse Click on a canvas ElementTo get the coordinate of a mouse click on a canvas element, we can use the clientX and clientY properties.For instance, we can write:const getCursorPosition = (canvas, event) => {  const rect = canvas.getBoundingClientRect();  const x = event.clientX - rect.left;  const y = event.clientY - rect.top;  console.log(x, y);}We can use the getBoundingClientRect method to get the left and top offsets of the canvas.We subtract them from clientX and clientY respectively to get the coordinate of the mouse in the canvas.Then we can use this function by writing:const canvas = document.querySelector('canvas')canvas.addEventListener('mousedown', (e) => {  getCursorPosition(canvas, e)})Check if a JavaScript String is a URLWe can use the URL constructor to check if a JavaScript string is a valid URL.For instance, we can write:const isValidUrl = (string) => {  try {    new URL(string);  } catch(e) {    return false;    }  return true;}We try to create a URL instance to see if it’s a URL.If it is, then no exception would be thrown and we return true .Otherwise, we return false in the catch block since an exception would be thrown when the URL constructor tries to parse an invalid URL string.Use encodeURI or encodeURIComponent for Encoding URLsencodeURI assumes that the input is a complete URI that we’re passing in as the argument.encodeURIComponent encoded everything with a special meaning.For instance, we can write:encodeURIComponent('&');and returns “%26” .And we can write:encodeURI('http://example.com/?foo= bar')and get “http://example.com/?foo=%20bar"" .Photo by Ashwini Chaudhary on UnsplashConclusionWe can disable div interactivity with some CSS.There are 2 ways to return a rejected promises in an async function.The URL constructor takes the hard work out of parsing URL strings.Script tags can be dynamically inserted.We can check a mouse position on a canvas with some properties.Calculating yesterday’s date can be done with the Date instance methods.JavaScript In Plain EnglishEnjoyed this article?

How to Stop Stressing Over Your Code Documentation,https://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-to-stop-stressing-over-your-code-documentation-f1e92bc5fa8?source=tag_archive---------4-----------------------,"Software Development,Web Development,Software Engineering,Programming","Photo by Austin Chan on UnsplashI am a new convert to code documentation.I neglected code documentation for way too many of my programming years. It stressed me out. I avoided it like kids avoided picking me in basketball pick-up games as a kid.I was terrified that I was going to do it wrong or that it wouldn’t make any sense or that I was going to be ‘found out’ as a terrible programmer. I hid under the excuse that good code should self-document. I do agree that other engineers should easily know what good code is doing but we need to also understand the wonderfully existential question of “Why it exists.”After too many years of neglect, I was forced to face the reality that my code needed documentation. It needed it badly.Overwhelmed by DocumentationI decided to confront my documentation fears with a cowardly advance. I inched deeper into the freezing pool of documentation one step at a time.I started out small.I added 1 line doc blocks that described my code functions & classes in single sentences. I moved further into the pool by adding documentation to my variables & function parameters and eventually I was fully submersed through documenting examples and helping the future me understand why I took this path and what I want to do in the future.Now I’m belly-flopping my way into the pool of documentation before I even start writing any code.I graduated from the no documentation camp into the belief that good documentation brings the best code to life. I am no longer petrified at the thought my functions, classes and if blocks may need a doc block.My fear of documentation no longer owns me. My code eats doc blocks as Popeye eats spinach. Code Documentation is now the V8 to my work.It wasn’t an easy switch. I didn’t just wake up one day with superhuman code documentation superpowers gifted to me.It was a process that I took a step at a time.Stop Overthinking Your Code DocumentationLet’s start with the obvious.Documentation isn’t prose to impress your high school English teacher. It has a purely functional purpose. It doesn’t need wit. It can and should have personality but that is secondary. It has a singular and simple functional purpose for existence. Documentation never needs to belly gaze asking itself, “What is my purpose in life.”It is simple.Documentation exists to express the reason for the code’s existence in a human readable language. That is it. It needs to be succinct so that your future self can read the documentation and understand what you were smoking when you wrote the code.Don’t overthink code documentation.You may believe I’m an odd man to write engineers overthink code documentation. It is true that I am odd but it is also true that I am right. You are overthinking your documentation if you look at your functions for more than a few moments wondering what to document.Just write something.Documentation doesn’t have to be perfect. It doesn’t have to be coherent. It doesn’t have to be complete and it can be wrong. Code documentation doesn’t exist on stone tablets that must be hung as law for everyone to follow.You can, should and must update your documentation.Good documentation is the conversation between you and the code. You begin the conversation with certain assumptions. As you write your code, the conversation morphs into new directions. Tangents happen. The best conversations flow into a natural progression. This is the same for code and documentation.Good documentation is the conversation between you and the code.Don’t force documentation into a perfect state because this will force your code into a dangerously inflexible state. Allow it to breathe and change as the conversation with yourself and your code changes.Start With the Documentation Before You Write the CodeWhat do you when you are ready to start programming a new feature?My guess is that you open up the editor and either begin brain dumping the code in your head or take the test driven approach and start writing your tests.Both directions are wrong.Write the functional story of what you are doing in a human language before you start on any code or tests.I am not referencing functional requirements are architectural diagrams. I assume you’ve properly broke down the project. You already have the high level business and functional understanding of what you are doing. If not, then you need to be reading another article about proper project architecture and come back to this one.You need to open up your IDE or text editor and write the story of what you are going to program before you write a line of code.Document why an if statements exists and the problem it solves before you write the if block.Explain the backstory of why you want to add this new function or class. Let me know what you want to accomplish and when I should and shouldn’t use the new function.Describe what that new constant does and it’s purpose for living.Your code should never be added to empty files. The code should fill in the blanks of well documented instructions.Good Documentation Answers the Existential Questions for The CodeHonestly, think of your code as a 20 year old college student flunking their way through Intro to Philosophy.It wants to know why it exists? What is its purpose in life? How will it know if it has any value? Does anyone care about it?This is why you write documentation.You want to let your code know that it has a purpose for existence and that it doesn’t need to spend the next 10 years living in your basement wondering what job is right for them.Documentation Should Not Overwhelm You. It Should Help You Understand What You Want to DoDon’t overwhelm yourself with code documentation. It is not an exercise in grammar and technical ability. Good engineers aren’t going to review your documentation and base your entire worth on a poorly constructed doc block. Bad engineers will. But who cares as they are bad engineers.Make a decision to become a story teller where the code fills in the blanks. Your documentation is the narrator and directs the story to its final resolution.Related Code Documentation Content You May EnjoySecret to Good Programming?

Build a Sparkline Vue Component,https://travishorn.com/build-a-sparkline-vue-component-d3fdec764145?source=tag_archive---------5-----------------------,"Web Development,Data Visualization,Vuejs,D3js,JavaScript","Sparklines can be used to quickly visualize data variance. They are small and intuitive to understand.We’ll be using Vue and D3 to build a small sparkline component using Vue.js. In the next article, I’ll show you how to use this component to build a “dashboard” for easy visualization of many data points.First, make sure you have the Vue CLI installed. Then, create a new project.vue create sparkboardThe CLI will ask you questions about how you’d like to set up your project. You can accept the defaults or manually select features you like. I manually selected…BabelLinter/FormatterESLint + PrettierLint on saveIn dedicated config filesOnce the project has been created, start the dev server.cd sparkboardnpm run serveCreate a new component in the src/components directory called SparkLine.vue<template>  <svg viewBox=""0 0 200 40"">    <path d=""M 0 20 H 200""          fill=""none""          stroke-width=""3""          stroke-color=""gold"" />  </svg></template><script>export default {  name: ""SparkLine""}</script>Notice the root element of the component is an <svg>. This is the element we’ll bind D3 to when creating the chart. You can also see that the <svg> has a viewBox of 0 0 200 40. This gives it the dimensions of 200 pixels wide by 40 pixels tall. The actual width and height are determined by the element’s container, but the 200 x 40 viewBox gives it a good height to width ratio for a sparkline chart.Finally, there is a <path> inside the <svg>. This is our actual line. For right now, it’s just a hard-coded, perfectly straight, horizontal line.We can see our progress so far by putting our component in the main App.vue. In that file, replace everything in the template with…<template>  <div style=""width: 100px"">    <SparkLine />  </div></template>Notice how we put the sparkline component inside a container element with a narrow width. This will give it the traditional small appearance.Now, replace the script section with…<script>import SparkLine from ""./components/SparkLine.vue"";export default {  name: ""App"",  components: {    SparkLine  }};</script>You may notice how we just changed HelloWorld to SparkLine. Everything else is the same.Since we cleared out the template, we no longer need the default styles. So feel free to remove everything from the <style> section.Now run the development server.npm run serveWith the server running, we can visit http://localhost:8080/ and see our progress so far.It is literally just a horizontal yellow line, which is perfect because that’s exactly what we’ve coded so far.Let’s code a way to pass data into this component so we can display it using this line.Going back to SparkLine.vue and adding to the script section, define a prop called data. This prop will be an array. We’ll also tell it to simply use a basic array of [0, 0] if no data is passed in.<script>export default {  name: ""SparkLine"",  props: {    data: {      type: Array,      default() {        return [0, 0];      }    }  }};</script>We can pass data into the component back in App.vue like so:<SparkLine :data=""[808, 1475, 1426, 1884, 1396]"" />Note that the line above replaces the existing <SparkLine />. Also note that these are just random values I made up. Feel free to use whatever you like.Now it’s time to use D3.js to bind data to the line. First, install D3.npm i d3Then, in SparkLine.vue, import it at the top of the <script> section.import * as d3 from ""d3"";When the component is mounted, we need to tell D3 to set up the chart. So below the props definition, add a mounted() function.export default {  name: ""SparkLine"",  props: { /* ... snip ... */ },  mounted() {    // We will set up the chart here  }};Inside the mounted() function, tell D3 where our chart will go.this.chart = d3.select(""svg""); // Targets the (only) SVG elementNow we need to set up x and y scales. The x axis will start at the very start (0) of our chart and end at the very end (right) of our chart (200).this.x = d3.scaleLinear().range([0, 200]);And the y axis will start at the bottom (40) and end at the top (0) of our chart.this.y = d3.scaleLinear().range([40, 0]);If you’ve used D3 scales before, you might be wondering why we’re not setting the domain here. That’s because we’re going to put that logic in a separate function that can get called any time our data changes.Now we must define the line function.this.line = d3  .line()  .x((d, i) => this.x(i))  .y(d => this.y(d));What the code above does, is defines a D3 line where the x value is determined by the position of the data in the array and the y value is determined by the data point itself.Finally, let’s call a method to actually plot the data.this.plot();The function called in the line above doesn’t exist, yet. Let’s create it now.This will go in our components methods.export default {  name: ""SparkLine"",  props: { /* ... snip ... */ },  methods: {    plot() {      // Plotting code goes here    }  },  mounted() { /* ... snip ... /* }};The first thing to do inside of plot() is to set the domain of our scales according to the data.this.x.domain([0, this.data.length - 1]);this.y.domain(d3.extent(this.data));As you can see above, the x scale’s domain starts at 0 and ends at the end of the array. The y scale’s domain starts with the smallest data value and ends with the largest.Now to actually adjust the chart line. Also in plot():this.chart.select(""path"").attr(""d"", this.line(this.data));If you save SparkLine.vue and look again at http://localhost:8080/ (assuming the development server is still running), you can see the sparkline!What happens if our data changes? All we need to do is call the plot() method again. Set up a watcher to do that. This watcher will “watch” the data property and call plot() any time it changes.export default {  name: ""SparkLine"",  props: { /* ... snip ... */ },  watch: {    data() {      this.plot();    }  },  methods: { /* ... snip ... /* },  mounted() { /* ... snip ... /* }};And now our component can react to data changes!While all of this works as a single component, there’s one important bug that we have to fix if we want to re-use this component more than once on the same page. Right now, we have D3 selecting the sole <svg> element on the page. If you have more than one <svg> on the same page, D3 is just going to select the first one it finds. This is no good. We want to select the <svg> in this component.To do that, we can assign our <svg> a unique ID.First, install nanoid.npm i nanoidImport it into our component at the top of the <script> section.import { nanoid } from ""nanoid"";Create a new id data property and use nanoid to make it random.export default {  name: ""SparkLine"",  props: { /* ... snip ... /* },  data() {    return {      id: `chart-${nanoid()}`    };  },  methods: { /* ... snip ... /*},  mounted() { /* ... snip ... /*}};We use the template string `chart-${nanoid()}` so that our random id is in the format chart-kHM_8K1yz8GGq6MVBwfoG or chart-VG5J13fYZIdMBrSDRuEBX for example. It’s always random.In the template, set the <svg>'s id to this new id.<svg :id=""id"" viewBox=""0 0 200 40"">Finally, tell D3 to select the element based on this ID.Replacethis.chart = d3.select(""svg"");withthis.chart = d3.select(`#${this.id}`);That’s it Our sparkline component is done! You can add multiple sparkline components on the same page and they’ll all show up perfectly.<template>  <div style=""width:100px"">    <SparkLine :data=""[808, 1475, 1426, 1884, 1396]"" />    <SparkLine :data=""[3246, 1941, 2649, 1633, 1262]"" />    <SparkLine :data=""[190, 128, 209, 208, 116]"" />  </div></template>All code for this article is open source and published on GitHub.travishorn/vue-sparkline-componentBasic sparkline component for Vue.js using D3.js npm install npm run serve npm run build npm run lint See Configuration…github.comIn the next article, I’ll show you how to use this component to build a “dashboard” for easy visualization of many data points.Exercise to the readerThe component is hard-coded to have a yellow line. What if you wanted to be able to set the color individually per component?

The Basics of Service Workers,https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/the-basics-of-service-workers-e37bd9a697f?source=tag_archive---------6-----------------------,"Service Worker,JavaScript,Programming,Web Development,Coding","This article is an extension of my previous article where I talked about Web Workers. In this post, I will talk about Service Workers.Service Worker is a script that works on browser background without user interaction. It acts like a proxy server between a browser(web application) and network allowing you to control how network requests from your page are handled. This script could intercept network requests, help in creating effective offline experiences, and update assets residing on the server among other things.PrerequisitesThere are certain points that you should keep in mind while working with Service Workers.⦁ During development, you can use the localhost, but to deploy it on a site you’ll need to have HTTPS setup on your server.⦁ Service Worker is terminated when not in use and restarted when it’s next needed, so you cannot rely on global state within a Service Worker. If there is information that you need to persist and reuse across restarts, you can use Indexed DB.⦁ Service Workers can’t access the DOM directly. Instead, it can communicate with the pages it controls by responding to messages sent via the postMessage interface, and those pages can manipulate the DOM if needed.Service Worker Life CycleA Service Worker has a lifecycle that is completely separate from your web page.To install a Service Worker you have to first register it on your main page. Registering a Service Worker will cause the browser to download the Service Worker file and initiate its install step in the background.During the install step, you can cache assets which can be fetched later. If the install was successful then Service Workers enter into the activation phase.After the activation step, the Service Worker will control all pages that fall under its scope, though the page that registered the Service Worker for the first time won’t be controlled until it’s loaded again. This is because the page’s fetches event won’t go through a Service Worker unless the page request itself went through a Service Worker.Once a Service Worker is in control, it will be in one of two states: either the Service Worker will be terminated to save memory, or it will handle fetch and message events that occur when a network request or message is made from your page.Below is a simplified diagram of the life cycleService Worker LifecycleRegister a Service WorkerTo kickstart a Service Worker you should first register it on your main page. This tells the browser where your Service Worker JavaScript file lives.In index.html we added the script to register the Service Worker. This code checks if Service Worker API is available, and if it is, then the Service Worker at /sw.js is registered after the page is loaded. The file location that I used for sw.js is at the root of the domain. This means that the Service Worker’s scope will be the entire origin. In other words, this Service Worker will fetch events for everything in this domain. If we store the Service Worker file at /public/sw.js, then the Service Worker would only see fetch events for pages whose URL starts with /public/ (i.e. /public/page1/, /public/page2/).Install a Service WorkerAfter registering we move to the install phase. This is the first event a Service Worker gets. It’s triggered as soon as Service Worker executes and it’s only called once per Service Worker. During this phase, you’ll want to cache some static assets. If all the files are cached successfully, then the Service Worker becomes installed. If any of the files fail to download and cache, then the install step will fail and the Service Worker won’t activate (i.e. won’t be installed).In the example above Service Worker is listening to install events. cache.open will create a new cache named ‘SERVICE_WORKER’ and then using cache.addAll we will add all the URLs we want to cache. The events.waitUntil extends the lifetime of the install event until the passed promise resolves successfully or gets rejected. If the promise is rejected, the installation is considered a failure, and the Service Worker is abandoned.Here we have cached one image, one CSS file, and an offline page which will be fetched if we have a network issue. The offline.html page is using the same CSS and image as that of the main page to reuse the cached files.You can check if your Service Worker is enabled by checking chrome://inspect/#service-workers or by choosing Service Workers option in Application tab of the browserYou can also check out the cache created in browsers.⦁ For Chrome, check the Cache Storage option of the Application tab, where a cache ‘SERVICE_WORKER’ would be created. It will contain all the files that you have cached.⦁ For Mozilla, check the Storage tab where Cache Storage will be containing a cache named ‘SERVICE_WORKER’.Service Worker in Chrome BrowserActivation of Service WorkerAfter the Service Worker is installed, the next step will be its activation. Once activated, the Service Worker will start controlling all pages that fall under its scope.This event is an ideal location for removing old cached static content if a newer version of the same has been created (will talk about it later section).Cache And Return RequestsNow that the Service Worker is activated and controlling all the pages in its scope, our next step should be returning the cached response.When the user navigates to a different page or refreshes, the Service Worker will begin to receive fetch events.We have defined a fetch event listener and there are two conditions in it. First, when the user tries to navigate to the HTML page and there is an error(e.g: network error), then we simply return the offline page from the cache. In another case, we match our cache with the requested URL and if we have a matching response, we return the cached value, else we return the result of a call to fetch, which will make a network request and return the data if anything can be retrieved from the network.caches.match() looks at the request and finds any cached results from any of the caches your Service Worker created. The event.respondWith() method prevents the browser default fetch handling, thus allowing you to provide a promise as a response yourself.To test this functionality, you can use the built-in developer tools in Chrome. Move to the Network tab and change the online to offline and refresh the page.Boom !! you will be redirected to the offline page(offline.html).Updating a Service WorkerWhen a user navigates to your site the browser tries to redownload the script file that defined the Service Worker in the background. If there is even a byte’s difference in the Service Worker file compared to what it currently has, it considers it new.This new Service Worker will be installed. But at this point, the old Service Worker is still controlling the current pages so the new Service Worker will enter a waiting state. Once the currently opened pages of your web app are closed, the old Service Worker will be killed by the browser and then the newly-installed Service Worker will take full control. This is when its ‘activate’ event will be fired.If you want that your new Service Worker should override the older one then use self.skipWaiting().One common task we do in an activate event is cache management. Here we can wipe out old caches that were created by the older Service Workers. The reason to do this here is that if you were to wipe out any old caches in the install step, the old Service Worker, which keeps control of all the current pages, will suddenly stop being able to serve files from that cache.This code above looping through all of the caches in the Service Worker and deleting any caches that aren’t defined in the cache whitelist.This is the combined code of the Service Worker file (sw.js).Use CasesWhat we discussed above are basic usages of Service Worker, but Service Workers are much more than that. They can be used to provide some unique features:Push notifications — These are messages that pop up on the user’s device. They allow users to opt-in to timely updates from web apps.Background sync — These allow you to defer actions until the user has stable connectivity.Periodic sync (future) — API that provides functionality for managing periodic background synchronization.Geofencing (future) — The web app gets a notification when the device crosses a geofence, without the need to periodically query Geolocation API.Thank you for taking out the time to r­­­­­­­­­­­­­­ead my article.JavaScript In Plain EnglishNew JavaScript + Web Development articles every day.Follow6 Service WorkerJavaScriptProgrammingWeb DevelopmentCoding6 claps6 clapsWritten byKirti ChaturvediFollowJavaScript enthusiast, Full Stack Software developer for 4 years.FollowJavaScript In Plain EnglishFollowNew JavaScript + Web Development articles every day.FollowWritten byKirti ChaturvediFollowJavaScript enthusiast, Full Stack Software developer for 4 years.JavaScript In Plain EnglishFollowNew JavaScript + Web Development articles every day.More From Medium3 Minimally-Invasive Supercharged JS DEBUG Tools You Didn’t Know You HadRichard Schloss in JavaScript In Plain EnglishFind the Points Where a Line Segment Intercepts an Angled Ellipse (in JavaScript / TypeScript)Steve RuizReact is not the new JQueryDmitri GrabovSolving the Climbing Staircase ProblemAlisa Bajramovic in JavaScript In Plain EnglishNext.js for React: Why You Should Give It a Try Right NowLouis Petrik in Better ProgrammingHow To Make Any File Publicly Available In AngularBhargav Bachina in Bachina LabsHow To Run Multiple Versions of Node.js on LinuxJohn Au-Yeung in Better Programming3 Pretty Cool Built-In Node.js ModulesLouis Petrik in JavaScript In Plain EnglishLearn more.Medium is an open platform where 170 million readers come to find insightful and dynamic thinking."
"JavaScript Best Practices — Conditionals, Classes, and Over-Optimization",https://medium.com/dev-genius/javascript-best-practices-conditionals-classes-and-over-optimization-e43835a3654f?source=tag_archive---------7-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Ana Silva on UnsplashTo make code easy to read and maintain, we should follow some best practices.In this article, we’ll look at some best practices we should follow to make everyone’s lives easier.Avoid ConditionalsWe can avoid conditionals and replace it with polymorphism.For instance, instead of writing:class Person {  // ...  getData() {    switch (this.type) {      case ""student"":        return this.getStudentData();      case ""employee"":        return this.getEmployeeData();      case ""manager"":        return this.getManagerData();    }  }}We can split them into multiple subclasses:class Person {  // ...}class Student extends Person {  // ...  getData() {    return this.getStudentData();  }}class Employee extends Person {  // ...  getData() {    return this.getEmployeeData();  }}class Manager extends Person  {  // ...  getData() {    return this.getManagerData();  }}Instead of a big class that does multiple things, we split them into multiple subclasses.The shared code is in Person .Thes rest is in the methods exclusive to the subclasses.this.getStudentData, this.getEmployeeData, and this.getManagerData can stay in the subclasses.Don’t Over-OptimizeWe shouldn’t over-optimize our code if we have to sacrifice readability.For instance, we don’t have to cache loop lengths.It won’t bring much difference in performance in modern browsers, but we make our code harder to read.Instead of writing:for (let i = 0, len = items.length; i < len; i++) {  // ...}We write:for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {  // ...}or just use the for-of loop:for (const item of items) {  // ...}Remove Dead CodeWe should remove dead code since they aren’t used.For instance, instead of writingconst oldRequest = (params) => {  //...}const newRequest = (params) => {  //...}newRequest({  //...});We write:const newRequest = (params) => {  //...}newRequest({  //...});Use Getters and SettersWe should use getters and stress on objects.They let us do validation before getter and setting data.And we can encapsulate any logic that’s run before getting.Logging and error handling is easier, and we can lazy load our stuff in getters.For instance, instead of writing:function makeCart() {  // ...  return {    cart: []    // ...  };}We write:function makeCart() {  let cart = [];  function getCart() {    return cart;  }  function setCart(newCart) {    cart = newCart;  }  return {    // ...    getCart,    setCart  };}We create a cart with a private cart and a getCart getter function and setCart setter function.We expose what we want in our code.Now we can use it by writing:const cart = makeCart();cart.setBalance(cartItems);Make Objects have Private MembersWe can use closures to keep private members in objects.For instance, instead of writing:const person = {  name: 'james',  age: 20}We write:const person = (() => {  const age = 20;  return {    name: 'james'  }})();We return an object with the name but not the age .That’s hidden in the function.This one of the ways to keep private variables.Module members are also private unless we export them.Prefer Class Syntax Over Constructor FunctionsThe constructor function makes inheritance harder.To do inheritance, we’ve to inherit the methods and add instance methods to the prototype of the constructor.For instance, we write:const Animal = function(name) {  this.name = name;};Animal.prototype.move = function() {};const Dog = function(name) {  Animal.call(this, name);  this.age = age;};Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;Dog.prototype.bark = function() {};We’ve to create the Animal constructor and add instance methods to its prototype.Then we create the Dog constructor and call the Animal constructor with the arguments.Then we inherited the methods from the Animal ‘s prototype with Object.create .And then we set the constructor property of its Prototype to itself to get the right result when we use instanceof .Then we add instance methods exclusive to Dog .With the class syntax, it’s much easier.For instance, we write:class Animal {  constructor(name) {    this.name = name;  }  move() {    /* ... */  }}class Dog extends Animal {  constructor(age) {    super(name);    this.age = age;  }  bark() {    /* ... */  }}We put the constructor and methods all inside the class.We call the parent constructor with super ,And we extends to indicate inheritance.Photo by Victor B. on UnsplashConclusionThe class syntax makes inheritance much easier.Conditionals can be replaced with polymorphism.If optimization doesn’t bring much benefit and make our code harder to read, then don’t do it.Dev GeniusCoding, Tutorials, News, UX, UI and much more related to developmentFollow150 Sign up for Best StoriesBy Dev GeniusThe best stories sent monthly to your email. Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

The Essentials Of Hosting A Website,https://medium.com/age-of-awareness/how-to-host-a-website-f668a1202f?source=tag_archive---------8-----------------------,"Startup,Entrepreneurship,Web Development,Business,Ecommerce","Photo by Kevin Bhagat on UnsplashHosting a new website is an essential part of publishing and establishing your presence on the web.There’s an overwhelming amount of information about the topic, however, the answer depends on multiple factors.Your technical experience, type of website, budget, and size all play a part in your decision.Looking Into Web Hosting ProvidersWeb hosting is a service, just like any other you can think of. Let’s say you’re buying a new car, you (probably) wouldn’t walk into a dealership, point at the first vehicle you see and say that’ll do.You’d research makes, models, common defects, and compare prices.The more options you look into, the more informed your decision will be. The same concept applies to web hosting.Providers aren’t all the same.Some are better, or more suited to your needs than others. Some prioritize speed, while others focus on customer service. Some are geared towards small businesses, whilst others are more suited to agencies or enterprises.Where Do You Start From?Although you can click blindly through different web hosts on Google, it’s probably way too time-consuming to be productive. Furthermore, you won’t know which ones are legit, and which aren’t.Instead, I’d recommend looking into third-party guides or reviews.Having a professional opinion of the features and performance of every web host significantly narrows down the options. The following is a list of some of the best web hosting providers.BluehostDreamHostSiteGroundHostGatorHostingerInMotionWP EngineGoDaddyA2 HostingWhat’s Your Budget?Your budget will depend on the features you need, and the type of hosting you want.“But I’ve never done this before. How much does web hosting cost?”Glad you asked. You can find hosting providers that offer plans for less than $1 per month, and others offering plans for $2,000 per month.Having a rough idea of what you’re willing (and able) to spend will help you narrow down your options.Something like a small personal blog with a low volume of traffic can be handled for $5 to $10 per month. A small business or eCommerce platform would likely be in a higher price tier.Top Tip: Like any other service, you get what you pay for. Don’t expect to pay $2 per month for the best web hosting experience on Earth.Choosing A Hosting TypeIt’s time to determine the type of hosting that’s best for your website. There are four main options:Shared hosting — the most affordable type of web hosting. It doesn’t require a ton of technical knowledge. Your website will be sharing server resources with other sites. This will impact performance, and if another site on the same server has a traffic spike, the server can crash and bring your website down with it.VPS (Virtual Private Server) hosting — you’ll be on a single server that’s separated into multiple virtual machines. A step above shared hosting, you won’t be sharing your resources with anyone. Expect performance to be generally better, with more disk space, bandwidth, and faster loading speeds.Dedicated hosting — the majority of small websites do not need a dedicated server. This is usually reserved for large websites with enterprise-level volumes of traffic. Having said that, if you want complete control over your server settings and hosting environment (and maybe have some background knowledge), a dedicated server will offer this.Dedicated servers almost always deliver the highest performance.The downside? They are the most expensive type of web hosting; another reason why they’re not ideal for new or smaller websites.Cloud hosting — the newest form of hosting. It’s definitely becoming a popular choice with website owners. A cloud plan is ideal as it allows growth and will scale the server’s resources as your site gets bigger. In terms of price, cloud hosting is a step above shared hosting, but usually cheaper than a VPS plan.For new website owners who plan to grow as fast as possible in the coming months, a cloud hosting plan is a considerable option.Uptime, Resources, and Customer SupportUptime is one of the most important features when one considers web hosting. If the provider isn’t offering a minimum of 99.9% uptime, then look elsewhere. Most web hosts will offer an uptime guarantee, which implies you are entitled to compensation if they fail to meet that expectation.You also need to make sure your plan has enough resources to accommodate the website content and traffic. The first thing to look at is RAM, which is your storage.About 4 GB of RAM is enough for the average website.At later stages, you might also want to consider bandwidth. 120 GB of bandwidth is enough for 2,000 daily page loads of a 4 GB website. If you are expecting more traffic, or plan to have a larger website, you need to get more bandwidth.Lastly, customer service should be a priority. In a perfect world, nothing will ever go wrong with your website or servers.But we don’t live in a perfect world. It’s just a matter of time before something goes wrong.During a time of trouble, you want to be able to contact your web host immediately. Look for a plan that offers 24/7 support via phone and live chat.Anything Else To Consider?Yes. It’s a good idea to look beyond the introductory rate of a web hosting plan to make sure you can afford it in the coming years. Most web hosting providers heavily discount new contracts and then increase their fees upon renewal.You should also be looking for a plan that gives you good value for money.Some hosting providers will include extras in their plans. Common features to look for include:Free domains (usually for the first year)Free SSL certificateFree cPanel licenseGoogle Ads creditFree site builderFree site migrationUnlimited email accountsAutomatic backups (go for this one!)Money-back guarantees are also common. 30 days seems to be the industry standard, but some plans will go over 90 days if you change your mind.Alternative Option: Self HostingIt’s possible to host your website without using a web hosting provider. Using this method, you use your own computer or a Linux machine as a server. It requires a lot of technical experience and a good understanding of how websites and servers work. For this reason, I wouldn’t recommend this.Self-hosting can be slow, unstable, and unreliable. Apart from that, you’re responsible for all the server maintenance. Backups, software updates, and security? Yes, you have to handle those as well.Overall, self-hosting isn’t the best idea, especially for beginners. Just be aware it exists out there as well.The Moral Of The StoryTo keep things brief, when looking to host a website:1 — Research web hosting providers.2 — Determine your budget.3 — Choose a hosting type.4 — Consider things like uptime, resources requires, and customer support (there may be other factors as well).5 — Remember to think of the future in terms of cost and value.Bonus — Self-hosting is a thing, but not recommended.Good Luck!Daniel is a writer, senior teacher, and geographer based in Malta.

"Node.js Best Practices — Profile, Watch, and Requests",https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/node-js-best-practices-profile-watch-and-requests-4f657b02c2ec?source=tag_archive---------10-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by John Torcasio on UnsplashLike any kind of apps, JavaScript apps also have to be written well.Otherwise, we run into all kinds of issues later on.In this article, we’ll look at some best practices we should follow when writing Node apps.Use Node’s Built-in ProfilerNode comes with its own profiler to let us watch the performance of our app.To use it, we just add the --prof option when we run our app:node --prof app.jsThen we process our tick file that’s outputted from this by running:node --prof-process isolate-0x???????-v8.logAnd then we can read the tick file processing result.There’s a [Summary] section with the data that came from the profiling.It consists of what kind of code is run like library and nonlibrary code.It also shows what language the code is written in.Use a Code Change Watcher to Automatically Restart Your Node AppTo make developing Node apps easier, we should use a code change watcher.With them, the app is restarted when we change our code files.There are several packages that do that.One of them is Nodemon.We can install it by running:npm install -g nodemonThen we use nodemon instead of node to run our app.Another package to do this is Forever.We can install it by running:npm install -g foreverThen we start our app by running:forever start app.jsIt has some options like appending logs to a file instead of stdout, saving the process ID to a file, etc.Node-supervisor is another package we can use.To install it, we run:npm install -g supervisorIt has several options to change its behavior like not restarting on error, etc.Properly Use Logging in Node.jsconsole.log have a few problems.Once we built our app, we’ve to remove them all to avoid polluting our log files.Also, we have no options for filtering them.A better alternative is to use the debug module for logging.To use it, we require it by writing:const debug = require('debug')('my-app');where 'my-app' is our app name.Then we can log things with the debug function:debug(""hello world"", someVar, someOtherVar);We can pass in whatever we want to the function to log them.To turn on debug messages when we run our app, we run:DEBUG=my-app node app.jsThe value for DEBUG should match the name we passed in when we required it.The name of the app instance can also be namespaced:const debug = require(""debug"")(""my-app:startup"");This lets us distinguish each level of debugging precisely.So we can run:DEBUG=my-app:startup node app.jsto log startup messages and:DEBUG=my-app:* node app.jsto log all messages in the namespace.Properly Use PromisesWe should avoid creating new promise each time a request is made.Instead, we can put it in a function and reuse it:const axios = require('axios');const makeRequest = (options) => {  return axios(options)};const getRequest = (url) => {  const options = {    method: ""GET"",    url  };  return makeRequest(options);};const getProfile = (profileId) => {  return getRequest(`/profile/${profileId}`);};We make a request Axios, which returns a promise.This way, we can reuse the piece of generic request code for all requests.Photo by Bradley Ziffer on UnsplashConclusionWe can profile our app with the built-in profiler.Also, we can use packages to restart our app when code changes.The debug module is good for logging debug messages.And we can create one common function that makes all HTTP requests.JavaScript In Plain EnglishEnjoyed this article?

Building a custom carousel on React,https://medium.com/@luisbrimeg/building-custom-carousel-controllers-on-react-fb29aecc8815?source=tag_archive---------11-----------------------,"React,Front End Development,JavaScript,Web Development,Programming","Photo by ckturistando on UnsplashWhile building from scratch a static website using React, Gatsby and MaterialUI as my UI framework, I stumbled with the issue of creating an image carousel with custom controllers. At the time, my short investigation led me to already built components like React-Bootstrap’s Carousel and React Slick (which provide really good and sufficient solutions), it seemed they couldn’t fulfill my custom controllers needs. Looking back, it is possible this custom controller solution can be plugged in on these and other solutions, but that’s beyond the scope of this tutorial.Before moving on, be sure to checkout these projects for awesome solutions for a carousel on React: react-bootstrap, react-slick, react-carousel and react-image-gallery.Finished custom React CarouselThe issue: Like some carousels, I wanted mine to be controlled through dots at the bottom, with the requirement that if I had more than 6 slides (or any number) I needed the dots to be paginated, with a smaller dot indicating if there’s more content on that side.Cases of paginationFirst, we need to figure out all the cases of the pagination:First page: If there’s more content than our desired slides per page, only the last dot of our first page is going to be smaller to indicate another page.Middle page: If we have more than 2 pages, we’ll have one or more middle pages, where the first and last dot need to indicate there’s a previous and next page.Last page: Much like the first page, this page will only show its first dot smaller.Now that our cases are defined, we can figure out which dots need to be smaller; for that we are going to make a small pagination example with indexes:Pagination exampleAt the ends of every page we can see a pattern, but first let’s define the data we need in order to know the indexes of the smaller dots. We need the currentPage where we are “standing” at any given moment; our dataPerPage so we can perform the pagination; and finally the totalPages of our carousel.As we want to know if any end dot in the currentPage is going to be small, we need to calculate the ends in terms of the page. After some analysis we can identify these patterns:A left index is calculated if we multiply currentPage — 1 times dataPerPage — 1. We subtract to dataPerPage so we can keep our indexes starting at 0.leftIndex = (currentPage - 1) * (dataPerPage - 1)A right index is calculated if we multiply currentPage times dataPerPage — 1.rightIndex = currentPage * (dataPerPage - 1)If we add one more condition to each of these calculations of indexes, then we can identify the dots that are going to be smaller in our 3 cases. For the left-end index, if the index is 0 it will never be smaller; while for the right-end index, if our currentPage is equal to the totalPages, then we reached the end of our pages and we do not need the last dot to be small.Now we can create our big condition to check if a dot in our controller is at the end and if it needs to show that there is more content:if (  (    index === (dataPerPage - 1) * currentPage &&     currentPage < totalPages  ) || (    index === (dataPerPage - 1) * (currentPage - 1) &&    index !== 0  ))  return 'This dot is small'Coding the carousel methods 🎠Now that our pagination issue is solved, we can write the rest of our carousel and its controller so we have it all together and functional. For this carousel I used material-ui’s components and their transition animations.Before we start looking at the code details, I recommend you to look at Airbnb’s React style guide, my code tries to follow those standards.Starting with our component’s class declaration, we can see a few things that haven’t been mentioned:In the state I added cycles and timerId, these will help to add an autoplay functionality to the carousel. This is optional and although this is not recommended, I needed it for my use case. As you can see we are using some constant variables called DATA and DATA_PER_PAGE. These will hold the data for our slides and our number of slides per page respectively.The handleClick method will take care of handling clicks on our controller (I know, big shock).The handleCarouselTurn method will make the carousel move from slide to slide; and when it reaches the end, return it to the first slide.The getChangeOfPage method will help us to check if we reached another page of our pagination.Finally, a helper method called getPointIndexes will help us map our dots in the controller to a slide index with the help of our currentPage.First let’s look at the handleClick and handleCarouselTurn methods:handleClick receives the index of the slide/dot is going to move to and changes the state accordingly, calling our helper method to see if we changed pages to keep our pagination.handleCarouselTurn receives a timerId which comes from a setInterval function in charge of making the carousel turn by itself, as mentioned before. It checks if we reached the end of the carousel or if we have to move one position forward, as well as calling our helper method to check if we changed pages.Our first helper function, getPointIndexes will help us map the correct indexes of our current page. We get an array of all the possible indexes from 0 to DATA_PER_PAGE and then we apply a map function to get the correct indexes for our currentPage. For example, if currentPage = 2 and DATA_PER_PAGE = 6, then our helper method will return [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].Finally, getChangeOfPage method helps us to get the current page we are in after moving if it needs to be changed. It helps us render the navigation controller correctly. Before explaining the code, let’s discuss about a small feature of the controller we haven’t mentioned: if we click on an end dot, we would expect it to stay on that corresponding slide while taking us to the previous or next page. This will give our users full control of the carousel’s navigation, deciding when to return or advance. Changing our index layout a little like this:Final index layoutWith this new index layout we could easily control returning and advancing pages. For example: if we move to index 5 from the left, we would advance to page number 2; however, if we move to index 5 from the right, we would return to page number 1. In the getChangeOfPage method, we can check from where we are approaching an end index and if so, move or return from the current page.Now that all of our methods are defined and explained, we just have to render our component:First, we save our possible indexes for our controller on indexArray so we can properly render the pagination; then we can render all of our slides with a map function on our data (notice how I used the Fade component from material-ui to handle transition, the in prop will make it appear only when currentSlide matches the slide’s index).Finally, we can render our dot controller using our auxiliary indexArray. This array contains all of the possible indexes for a given page. It is possible that there’s an index out of range of our data, and that’s the reason we check with an if statement so the controller only renders the exact dots. In the style props of our dot, we can now use the condition we defined at the beginning so it can properly render if it is a small or normal dot. Take a look at the final result:And we are done! 🎉We learned how to create a custom complex carousel controller on React, that can be plugged-in on any already built carousel: take a look at the twin carousel I made using react-motion.

An in depth explanation of Promise.all and comparison with Promise.allSettled,https://medium.com/@mpodlasin/an-in-depth-explanation-of-promise-all-and-comparison-with-promise-allsettled-769032da9d9a?source=tag_archive---------12-----------------------,"JavaScript,Web Development,Front End Development,Software Development,Programming","In this article, we will deal with 2 static methods available on a Promise constructor: all and allSettled.We will find out what exactly they do, what are the differences between them and even how we could create our own polyfill for one of them.This will give us a deep understanding of those methods and of how Promises work in JavaScript in general.We will use simple examples, which you will be able to easily reproduce by yourself. So you are encouraged to follow along this article using some kind of online JavaScript repl, like this one.Let’s get started!Promise.allWith the introduction of the native Promises in ES6, we also received a static Promise.all method.It is one of the most basic ways to execute asynchronous tasks concurrently in JavaScript.It’s basic usage and behavior is very simple. You pass to it an array of Promises and then it waits for all of those Promises to get resolved. After that happens, you receive an array of results from all of the respective Promises.Say we have two Promises and one async function. First Promise resolves to a number, second resolves to a string and the Promise which will be returned by the async function will resolve to a boolean:We used an async function instead of a third Promise, to prove to you, that they are nothing more than functions returning Promises (you can read more on that in my article on async/await and Promise interoperability).We also used two different ways to create a Promise that resolves immediately to a chosen value — using Promise.resolve method and simply using the Promise constructor.The important thing to remember here is that there is a serious difference between the two first Promises and the async function. The two Promises already exist and are being executed. For example if they were representing HTTP requests, those requests would already be in execution at this moment in code.Meanwhile, in the case of the async function, nothing gets executed yet — the Promise that will resolve to a boolean doesn’t even exist yet! We will create it just before passing it to an array expected by the Promise.all.We put emphasis on those points, because a common misconception is that Promise.all somehow begins the execution of Promises passed to it. But this is not the case. By the time the Promises are provided to Promise.all in an array, they are all already being executed. (You can read about Promises being an eager mechanism in my article on 3 biggest mistakes made when using Promises).So Promise.all doesn't begin Promises execution, it just waits for them to finish. If all of the Promises already were resolved earlier (for example if all HTTP requests already have finished), then the Promise.all will resolve to a value almost immediately, because there is simply nothing to wait for anymore.To drive this point home, take a look on how we call the Promise.all method:First and second Promise already exist, so we simply pass them to the array. But because Promise.all expects Promises in that array, not functions (even if they are async!), we need to execute our async function, before passing its result to the array.So you can see that by the time Promise.all will receive the Promises, they will all already be in execution. Perhaps some of them will even be already resolved!Now we can use the array of results from all the Promises, which will be given to us when all of the Promises get resolved:This code will result in 3 three true being printed to the console.Note that we used an array destructuring to get three results from the three respective Promises. The order of the results in the array matches the order in which the Promises were passed to the Promise.all.As you could probably figure out by now, Promise.all itself returns a Promise. Thanks to the async/await & Promise interoperability, we can retrieve the results in a nicer way, still utilizing handy array destructuring:This looks much cleaner, but it will work only if that code is inside an async function or if your programming environment supports top-level await.Promise.all error handling & Promise.allSettledWe covered the basic behavior of the Promise.all. Let's now look at how it behaves, when one of the Promises passed to it throws an error. This will help us understand why Promise.allSettled static method was introduced in 2019.Let’s modify our previous example, so that one of the Promises results in an error:You can see that now the second Promise will result in an error, because we used reject method instead of resolve.Let’s add an error handling function to our Promise.all usage example:After we run this code, we only see Some error message logged to the console.What happened? Well, because one of the Promises thrown an error, Promise.all simply rethrows that error as well, even if all of the other Promises actually resolved successfully.Perhaps you already see an issue with that approach. Even though two out of the three Promises did not fail, we still can’t use their results in any way, simply because one of the Promises have thrown an error.That’s because Promises always end in one of the two states — resolved or rejected (which is exactly the same thing as “thrown an error”) — and there is no in-between.The same applies to the Promise returned from the Promise.all method here - either all the Promises passed to the method successfully resolve and the output Promise gets resolved or (at least one) of the Promises rejects and our output Promise immediately rejects as well, not caring about the values from the other, perhaps successful, Promises.So is there any way to regain those “missed” values from properly resolved Promises? Let’s try to do just that.What we can do is to try to handle the error from the Promise that we know will throw and return as it’s new value the error object (in our case string) that has been thrown:Note how we used catch method and an arrow function to retrieve the thrown error object and immediately return it again, so that it becomes a new ""successful"" value of a Promise. This new Promise does not fail anymore - the error has been handled and this Promise resolves correctly to a value. So for the Promise.all method it is no longer a Promise that failed.This way, even when the secondPromise throws an error, we will still receive values from the first and third Promises. What is more, instead of a value from the second Promise, we receive the error that it threw (a Some error message string), so we can handle an error based on that value.But obviously in a real application we don’t really know which Promises will fail, so we need to handle potential errors from all of them:Here we do the exact same thing as before, but we do it on all of the Promises, using map method. We then call Promise.all on mappedPromises, which have their errors handled, instead of original promises array, where the Promises can fail.Now running this example ends in a 3 Some error message three logged to the console.But the question appears. After that change, how can we know if the value that was printed to the console is a result of properly resolved Promise or a result of an error that we handled with catch? It turns out, we can't:So in order to fix that, we need to complicate our code a little bit.Instead of returning a values from the Promises directly, let’s wrap each of them in an object that will have a special flag. That flag will tell us if the value comes from a resolved (or “fulfilled” as we also sometimes say) Promise or from a rejected one:You see that if this Promise resolves to a value, it will return an object with the flag fulfilled and the value itself under the property value.If the Promise throws, it will return an object with the flag rejected and the error object itself under the property reason.Note that this newly constructed Promise never throws an error, in other words it never gets into rejected state. It always resolves to a value, but this value is an object, informing us what really happened to the original Promise — whether it resolved or rejected.Now we can apply this code to every Promise passed to the Promise.all:Let’s now run that Promise.all function and log the results to the console:After running the code you will see the following output:That’s exactly what we wanted!Even if some of the Promises fail (like the second one did), we still get the values from the Promises that resolved correctly.We are also getting error messages from the Promises that failed, so that we can handle those errors however necessary.Furthermore we can easily tell which values come from fulfilled Promises and which ones come from rejected ones, by reading the status property.Those three qualities are so often desired in programming with Promises, that Promise.allSettled was introduced.It works exactly as our elaborate code above, but it does all that work for you.You can see that, by adding following code to our snippet:So we first run our Promise.all(mappedPromises) where we did error handling by hand. We log the results to the console and also log newline character \n to make a space in the console so that we can see the results from the two separate methods more clearly.We than run Promise.allSettled(promises). Note that we run it on the original promises array, not mappedPromises. That's because allSettled will do all the error handling for us - that's the whole point of that method. So we simply pass it an array of our original Promises and we don't have to worry about anything else.At the end we just log the results from Promise.allSettled, to compare them to the results from Promise.all.Before running that code, make sure that you are in an environment that supports allSettled. After all, it is a fairly new addition. You can check the support here.After running the code, you will see that — indeed — both methods behave in the same way and have exactly the same output:Note that we basically created a polyfill for Promise.allSettled. As an exercise you can try to wrap our code into a function allSettledPolyfill that behaves like allSettled and test it on some other examples.Do they behave the same when used on more than 3 Promises? Do they behave the same when more Promises fail at the same time? Does passing an empty array to both of them end in the same result? Try it out for yourself!Promise.all vs Promise.allSettled — summaryWe explained in depth how Promise.all works. We then presented some of its characteristics that are sometimes undesirable. Those characteristics were a motivation to create a new method - Promise.allSettled, which we were able to program ourselves from scratch.Let’s finish the article by briefly summarizing the key differences between those two methods:Promise.all accepts an array of Promises and returns a Promise resolving to an array of values from all the respective Promises. Promise.allSettled accepts the same input, but the array it resolves to, stores objects wrapping the returned values, not the values themselves.If any of the Promises passed to Promise.all throws an error, Promise.all stops waiting for the other Promises and immediately rethrows the same error. Promise.allSettled on the other hand never throws an error. If some Promises fail, it still waits for all the other Promises to either resolve or reject and then simply marks the failed Promises with rejected flag on the object that it returns for that Promise.And that’s it! I hope that this article gave you a deep understanding of those two methods.They both have their place and deciding which one to choose is always a matter of how do you want your failing Promises to be handled.If you enjoyed this article, considered following me on Twitter, where I will be posting more articles on JavaScript programming.Thank you for reading!(Cover Photo by Jan Genge on Unsplash)Originally published at https://dev.to on August 15, 2020.Written byMateusz PodlasinIn-depth JavaScript articlesFollow2 2 2 JavaScriptWeb DevelopmentFront End DevelopmentSoftware DevelopmentProgrammingMore from Mateusz PodlasinFollowIn-depth JavaScript articlesMore From MediumJavaScript map(), filter(), reduce() IllustratedMeghana Vadlapally in The StartupThe Many Ways to Construct JavaScript ObjectsJohn Au-Yeung in The StartupGetting Started With React NativeAphinya Dechalert in mad<hashmap>Object-Oriented JavaScript — Errors and IterablesJohn Au-Yeung in JavaScript In Plain EnglishCopying to the clipboard in ReactFeargal WalshHow I made my portfolio website blazing fast with GatsbyMaribel Duran in freeCodeCamp.orgUnderstanding Cypress.io: An Automated Testing LibraryRahul Gupta in DSC RNGPITGetting Gatsby WrongChris Vibert in Better ProgrammingAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
GIT- VERSION CONTROL,https://medium.com/innvotech/git-version-control-681ea9598318?source=tag_archive---------13-----------------------,"Github,Git,Web Development,Version Control,Front End Development","I am gonna show you how to use command line to do things such as version control, how to clone repositories, how to fork, make pull requests, merge repositories and a whole bunch of really exciting things. So let’s get started!To initialize git in our folder, use:git initLet’s suppose you’re inside your working directory and here if you want to start tracking your changes, then you need to add your files to what’s called a STAGING AREA.This is actually a place in version control where you can decide which files you want to commit later. To see what’s currently inside your staging area, use the command:git statusIt will show you the untracked files which will be shown in red color and in order to add your files to the staging area and to start tracking changes in it , use the command(use git add . to add all the files to the staging area):git add (filename)git add .And now if you use git status, you can see your file is added and it is in green color. So now it is ready to be committed.So let’s go ahead and commit this in local repository under version control using:git commit -m ""any commit message""You can see what commits you have made using the following command:git logSometimes you might wonder, why not just go from the working directory straight to the local repository? Why do we need this extra step to go to the staging area??Well, sometimes you might not want to add all of your files to be tracked or all of your files to be committed. So staging area is a good place to try and figure out what are the things that you want git to ignore and what are the things you want to be tracked.So now let’s say i have been working on some file, and i have completely messed up everything.To check the differences between the current version and last version of my file,use:git diff (filename)I can actually revert the changes i have made locally in my working directory using:git checkout (filename)Now we have learned to work on the local version of git locally. Now i am gonna talk about creating remote repositories.To push your commits from local repository to remote repository in GitHub, use:git remote add origin (URL of your remote repo)git push -u origin masterThe -u flag(stands for upstream) will link your local repositories to your remote repositories. Our remote name is ‘origin’ and the branch name is ‘master’.Master branch is the default or the main branch of all your commits.Now we looked at how to push your local repository to a remote repository on GitHub.Working in a team:To clone a remote repository to pull it to your local repository, use:git clone (URL of the repo)To create a separate branch locally, usegit branch (branch-name)To check all the branches that exists,use:(the asterisk will show you the branch you’re currently in)git branchTo switch to a particular branch, use the following command:git checkout (branch-name)Make the necessary changes in your file.Then do:git add .git commit -m ""commit message""To merge changes to the master branch:git checkout mastergit merge (branch-name)git push -u origin masterTo push changes to your branch, use:git checkout (branch-name)git push -u origin (branch-name)Found this post useful?

The easiest way to create HTTP requests in React.js,https://medium.com/@soroushchehresa/the-easiest-way-to-create-http-requests-in-react-js-6fa4b1819b3c?source=tag_archive---------14-----------------------,"Web Development,React,Http Request,Axios,Axios React","Always when we are developing a web application with React, we have many options to create HTTP requests which using some of them could be complicated and time-consuming.For resolving this issue I created a simple React component with TypeScript as an npm package named axios-react to make HTTP requests so easier in React applications.🌐 axios-reactThis package is an HTTP client component for React with child function callback to create async requests in render based on Axios.If you are new to React or if you want to create an application with React fast, you can use this module to speed your development up!🤔 How Axios React works?Using axios-react is so easy, you just need to wrap your components with this module. Let’s see axios-react usage by the following steps:At first, you need to install this package:$ yarn add axios-react# or$ npm i -S axios-reactAnd then, you can make your HTTP request like this:import React from 'react';import Request from 'axios-react';const Demo = () => (  <Request    config={{      method: 'get',      url: 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1',    }}  >    {({ loading, response, error, refetch, networkStatus }) => (      <div>          {networkStatus && <span>{networkStatus}</span>}          {loading && <span>Loading...</span>}          {error && <span>{error.response.data}</span>}          {response && <h3>{response.data.title}</h3>}          <button onClick={refetch}>Refetch!</button>      </div>    )}  </Request>);An online real example:https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-2et9ls💡 How did axios-react implement?Import modules:import {   useState,   useEffect,   ReactChildren,   ReactChild,} from 'react';import axios, { AxiosResponse, AxiosError, AxiosRequestConfig } from 'axios';import isOnline from 'is-online';import root from 'window-or-global';Props type definition:interface Props {  children: ReactChild | ReactChildren;  skip: boolean,  config: object,}States definition:const [loading, setLoading] = useState<boolean>(false);const [error, setError] = useState<AxiosError<any> | null>(null);  const [response, setResponse] = useState<AxiosResponse<any> | null>(null);const [networkStatus, setNetworkStatus] = useState<string | null>(null);Check network status method implementation:useEffect((): void => {  checkNetworkConnection();}, []);const checkNetworkConnection = (): void => {  if ((typeof document != 'undefined') && root && isOnline) {    root.addEventListener('offline', () => {      isOnline({ timeout: 1000 })        .then(online => {          if (!online) {            setNetworkStatus('offline');          }      });    });    root.addEventListener('online', () => {      isOnline({ timeout: 1000 })        .then(online => {          if (online) {            setNetworkStatus('online');          }        });    });    isOnline({ timeout: 1000 })      .then(online => {       if ((online && networkStatus !== 'online') || (!online && networkStatus !== 'offline')) {         setNetworkStatus(online ? 'online' : 'offline');        }      });  }};Fetch method implementation:useEffect((): void => {  if (!skip) {    fetch();  }}, []);const fetch = (): void => {  if (config) {    setLoading(true);    axios(config)      .then((response: AxiosResponse<any>) => {        setResponse(response);        setLoading(false);      })      .catch((error: AxiosError<any>) => {        setError(error);        setLoading(false);      });  }};Return child function callback implementation:return children({   loading,   error,  response,   refetch: fetch,  networkStatus,});That’s it.

"<strong class=""bz"">Responsiveness through CSS</strong>",https://medium.com/dev-genius/responsiveness-through-css-e92fa7d14c6d?source=tag_archive---------15-----------------------,"CSS,Programming,Software Development,Web Development,Technology","What does it mean to be responsive? Let’s first, think about the times you’ve visited a website on different devices. For example, a desktop monitor, laptop or a phone. In all those cases, you might’ve noticed that the formatting was different for each device. In regards to all things web design/development, it’s about creating a website that formats accordingly to the device’s screen size. Because people can visit your app or website from so many devices, we have to take into that account and make sure our content is responsive to said devices. Look at the image below for example.Why is making content responsive important?The most important reason to make your content responsive is to avoid something like the phone on the left. The worst thing that could happen is that your content actually gets cropped! However, it isn’t just about making your content fit the website. It’s not just about making your content responsive but to be as responsive as possible.Which one do you think is more responsive and why? Don’t just look at the X and check at the bottom as the reason! Look at the phone on the left in the image above. While none of the elements appear to be cropped, imagine having to constantly zoom and adjust just to use a website. It probably wouldn’t take long for you to just go to another similar website that looks more like the one on the right. All the elements are bigger proportionately so you don’t have to constantly zoom in.Once you learn CSS, you’ll start to learn there are several ways to do so. One way, is to hardcode px but that could require exponentially more work and even then it has its own limitations. One thing we could do is use percentages. For example, let’s say you want an image to fit to the browser screen. Instead of doing something like img { width: 1000px px}. If the browser had a width greater than 1000px, your image would appear to be too small. If your browser size was less than 1000px, your image would appear cropped. If we couldn’t use percentages, you would have to hardcode for every possible width or create some roundabout method to deal with it. It would be simpler to do img { width: 100% }.You may have heard or came across something called media queries. This is how we deal with different browsers, devices, and so on. Media queries allow us to change elements on our content based on a certain condition if it is met. For example, I’m going to reference this example from w3schools.@media only screen and (min-width: 601px) { div.example {  font-size: 80px; }}@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) { div.example {  font-size: 30px; }}In this example, if the browser width is equal to or less than 600px, the font-size would be 30px. If the browser width is more than 600px, the font-size would be 80px. This is just one of the limitless possibilities you could do with media queries.ConclusionIn summation, it is imperative to create content that is as responsive as possible to create the best experience for a user. Plus, you could make a really cool UI with it. Look at the links below for the documentation and examples.Using media queriesMedia queries are useful when you want to modify your site or app depending on a device's general type (such as print…developer.mozilla.orgResponsive Web Design Media QueriesMedia query is a CSS technique introduced in CSS3.

Jamstack and the Future of SEO,https://medium.com/digital-realm/jamstack-and-the-future-of-seo-e9109702dc46?source=tag_archive---------16-----------------------,"Jamstack,SEO,Digital Marketing,Web Development,Marketing","Photo by Diana Parkhouse on UnsplashThe web is currently going through a paradigm shift of sorts. The shift from web 2.0 is well underway and as it seems Jamstack is gradually but steadily taking the lead.What is Jamstack?Simply put, Jamstack is a new and emerging method of web development that utilizes JavaScript, APIs and Markup. Hence, the name Jamstack, but what Jamstack offers is more than just a fancy name.The larger concept and the techniques involved in Jamstack web development are a refreshing change from the conventional web development approaches. As it turns out, Jamstack offers greater opportunities in implementing out of the box thinking in terms of deploying innovative and scalable solutions very fast.The core focus of Jamstack is its out of the box SEO friendly approach and its undeniable and so far, unrivaled performance benchmarks. Moreover, its architecture greatly enhances security with minimum costs.Decoding JamstackPeople who learn about the buzz of Jamstack always ask, what’s so special about Jamstack anyway? But the answer, almost every time is very satisfying.Now think of a large website, conventionally, this website will be composed of a tightly integrated frontend, backend and a database. But in case of Jamstack, APIs do all the magic & frontend can easily be decoupled from the backend and in many cases you won’t be needing a database at all.A new concept of headless CMS has emerged with the introduction of Jamstack technology. That has completely decoupled the backend from fronend even in the case of complex content management systems.The core philosophy of Jamstack lies in the fact that pre-rendered static web pages are the most performant, secure and great for SEO.Jamstack uses Javascript static site generators like Gatsby & Next.js to create super fast, SEO friendly, static web pages while implementing APIs for dynamic micro services that makes live server side processing kind of irrelevant.Moreover, using Jamstack platforms like Netlify & Vercel makes web deployment super easy for developers.Jamstack and SEOWell, in terms of Search Engine Optimiztion (SEO), web development can’t get better than this. Jamstack provides the perfect SEO friendly qualities for a website of any size.Static pre-rendered web pages are always indexed without any issue by Google bots. Plus, faster loading times translate into great user experience, ultimately increasing engagements.Moreover, using a static site generator like Gatsby for web development means all your on page technical SEO is covered out of the box, saving all those precious hours for other digital marketing activities.Looking AheadAlthough, it is taking some time for developers to take in all the unconventional philosophy of Jamstack. But, more and more developers are considering Jamstack a much better option.Gradually it is gaining in popularity with many hardcore early adopters singing its praises.Looking forward, Jamstack seems to be one of the major technologies to dominate the web development in the near future. And the most positive impact it is going to make is in the field of SEO.Google, leading the search engine market is continuously upgrading its core algorithm with major enhancements on a monthly basis. While, SEOs are always on the run to figure out the best practices in order to make it in the top rankings.With Jamstack dominating in the near future, SEOs will find it much easier to deal with the most frustrating indexing issues. While hopefully, being in a much better position to provide a good user experience with their Jamstack tuned websites.Digital RealmDigital Marketing, Blockchain, CybersecurityFollow2 JamstackSEODigital MarketingWeb DevelopmentMarketing2 claps2 clapsWritten byWaheed IqbalFollowDigital marketing & growth hacking professional.

React Bootstrap — Modals and Navs,https://medium.com/dev-genius/react-bootstrap-modals-and-navbars-74f1c417c2f4?source=tag_archive---------17-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Lesly Derksen on UnsplashReact Bootstrap is one version of Bootstrap made for React.It’s a set of React components that have Bootstrap styles.In this article, we’ll look at how to add modals and navs to a React app with React Bootstrap.Modal SizesWe can change the size of the modal with the size prop.For example, we can write:import React from ""react"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";import Modal from ""react-bootstrap/Modal"";import Button from ""react-bootstrap/Button"";export default function App() {  const [show, setShow] = React.useState(false);const onClose = () => setShow(false);  const onClick = () => setShow(true);return (    <>      <Button variant=""primary"" onClick={onClick}>        open modal      </Button>      <Modal size=""sm"" show={show} onHide={onClose} keyboard={false}>        <Modal.Header closeButton>          <Modal.Title>Modal title</Modal.Title>        </Modal.Header>        <Modal.Body>          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Modern Style of Javascript with Arrow Functions,https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/modern-style-of-javascript-with-arrow-functions-daacd2cadd73?source=tag_archive---------19-----------------------,"JavaScript,Programming,Web Development,Technology,Front End Development","Source: GoogleBefore dive into the in-depth concept of arrow functions. I would like to discuss the hectic syntax of the old Javascript traditional approach. Arrow functions are introduced in ES6 which is a modern style for writing javascript functions. Since technology is getting modernized javascript is also getting modernizing day by day.In our old school Javascript programming, the functions are very easy to implement and use. A basic sayHello function will be like —function sayHello(name){      return ""Hello "" + name; }// Function Callconsole.log(sayHello(""Javascript""));The above program will generate the output of Hello Javascript. Traditional javascript functions are easy to understand and implement. But when it comes to the modern javascript functional programming style. It is a bit weird and difficult to understand. Beginners may get a bit difficult while learning for the first time because the syntax is not that much easy but when our hands get dirty with arrow functions definitely we will love it.Features of Arrow functionsSince arrow functions are new to the javascript community. Definitely, it should possess some better qualities than the existing approaches then only it will be helpful for the developers. The foremost features of the arrow functions are —Arrow functions with the body have no implicit return statement.It automatically binds the this to the surrounding code context.It is less verbose than the traditional javascript code.It doesn’t have a prototype property.Arrow functions don’t have inbuilt arguments property, unlike traditional Javascript functions. But we can achieve it with the help of rest parameters.Arrow functions are more convenient for callbacks, promises, or for methods like map, reduce, and forEach.Now we will try to reimplement the old school javascript function with the help of arrow functions. The syntax will be as given below —sayHello = name => ""Hello "" + name;// calling the functionconsole.log(sayHello(""Javascript""));The output for the above program will be as same as the previously written code.Arrow Function with zero argumentsThe syntax for the arrow function that has zero parameters —helloWorld = () => ""Hello World.!"";console.log(helloWorld()); //OUTPUT:  Hello World.!Arrow Function with One argumentAn arrow function with a single argument can be implemented in two ways —squareValue = n => n * n;console.log(squareValue(3));// OUTPUT: 9Or else we can also create the above function in a different way —squareValue = (n) => n * n;console.log(squareValue(3));// OUTPUT: 9The output will not change. we can declare parameters with brackets or without.Arrow function with multiple argumentsThe declaration of multiple parameters will be pretty simple —add = (number1, number2)=>{ return number1 + number2 };console.log(add(3,2));//OUTPUT: 5The issue with Inbuilt Arguments propertyIn traditional javascript functions, we have an inbuilt property called arguments which helps us to take the variable number of arguments by default which is an interesting and useful property. But Arrow functions doesn’t support that property.// Traditional Javascript Approachfunction addValues(){         sumValue = 0;        for(let i=0;i<arguments.length;i++){          sumValue += arguments[i];        }    return sumValue;}console.log(addValues(1,2,3,4,5));console.log(addValues(10,20,30));In the above code, there is an argument property that helps us to handle n a number of functional parameters. this helps us to produce dynamic results in certain situations. The result for the above code will be —console.log(addValues(1,2,3,4,5));  // 15console.log(addValues(10,20,30));   // 60But Arrow functions solve that issue with the following syntax approach —calc = (...args) => {         sumValue = 0;         for(let i=0;i<args.length;i++){             sumValue += args[i];         }   return sumValue;};console.log(calc(5,3,4,5));// OUTPUT 17 We can also decrease the number of lines with the help of reduce method as follows —reduce method with Arrow functionsArrow functions will work more effectively with the reduce functions that make the developer's life a lot easier.function sum(...args) {  return theArgs.reduce((prev, curr) => {    return prev + curr;  });}console.log(sum(1, 2, 3));//OUTPUT: 6console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4));// OUTPUT: 10ConclusionI hope you got a clear view of the arrow functions and why it is so popular. I discussed pretty much everything regarding arrow functions in a detailed manner.Hello busy people, I hope you had fun reading this post, and I hope you learned a lot here!

При принятии решения здесь необходимо учитывать множество аспектов — начиная от производительности и заканчивая стилем оформления кода. Своевременный выбор подходящих зависимостей может сэкономить программистам кучу времени, которое иначе пришлось бы тратить на исправления, доработки и рефакторинг. Одна из важных составляющих при работе с устройствами Интернета вещей — это размер двоичного кода приложения. О нём и пойдёт речь далее.Раньше в качестве серверных и клиентских платформ на Rust мы использовали actix-web и reqwest, одни из самых популярных в своих сегментах платформ с широким функционалом. В какой-то момент мы посчитали, что у этих платформ слишком уж много разных зависимостей, и решили поменять клиентскую платформу reqwest на awc, надеясь таким образом уменьшить общий размер двоичного кода.Меньший размер двоичного кода — это та цель, к которой всегда нужно стремиться, ведь известно, что HTTP клиент-сервер — это компонент, многократно переиспользуемый в приложениях, где задействована технология Интернета вещей. Однако после полной миграции общий размер двоичного кода у нас увеличился примерно на 3%.Тогда мы решили оценить, каким будет размер двоичного кода при разных сочетаниях пар этих платформ. Таким образом мы сможем выбрать наиболее подходящие зависимости для наших текущих и будущих проектов.Сначала мы определили базовые требования к каждой платформе, основываясь на типичном примере использования. Затем выбрали для тестирования несколько популярных пар приложений. После этого мы определились с тем, какие аспекты приложений было бы интересно проанализировать и сравнить. И, наконец, перешли к делу.Кроме того, было создано интерактивное веб-приложение для наглядного представления собранных нами данных, чтобы не только мы, но и все желающие могли проанализировать результаты. Помимо общего размера двоичного кода, было проанализировано предположительное влияние каждой из его зависимостей. Благодаря всему этому мы можем определиться с новой парой платформ (сервер + клиент), которую будем применять дальше.При определении правил тестирования, мы руководствовались потребностями HTTP клиент-сервера в нашем Updatehub Agent, где запускалась периодическая задача — проверять и, возможно, устанавливать обновления. Важно также, чтобы Agent всегда выдавал быстрый отклик на запросы других приложений или самого пользователя. Через небольшой HTTP API Agent предлагает набор конечных точек, к которым локальные приложения могут получить доступ, либо запрашивая информацию о выполнении агента, либо для запуска каких-то действий, например отмены загрузки.С учётом всего этого мы установили следующие требования:Асинхронный API: за что мы так любим Rust? За текущее состояние поддержки экосистемы async/await. Язык предлагает очень хороший и простой способ реализации параллельного выполнения, обеспечивая всегда быстрый отклик Agent на запросы.Общий доступ к внутреннему состоянию: в процессе обновления имеется несколько переменных, которые будут храниться в памяти и могут быть запрошены в любое время в Agent. Именно поэтому нам нужно, чтобы был протестирован и общий доступ к внутреннему состоянию между клиентом, используемым для отправки запросов в облако, и сервером, используемым для отправки ответов на локальный API.Один маршрут на сервер и на запросы: мы решили ограничиться только одним маршрутом при тестировании. Надеемся, что этого будет достаточно, чтобы связать соответствующие функции библиотек с конечным двоичным кодом — тогда можно будет их сравнить.Работа с OpenSSL при возможности: в Updatehub Agent мы уже используем OpenSSL для проверки цифровых подписей. Мы использовали OpenSSL по умолчанию всякий раз, когда это было возможно, поскольку в нашем сценарии применения remote link обычно использует протокол HTTPS.Установив требования к приложениям, мы определились с участниками нашего тестирования:Реализация      Клиент    Серверdummy                -         -actix_full         awc actix-webactix_reqwest  reqwest actix-webgotham_reqwest reqwest    gothamwarp_reqwest   reqwest      warphyper_reqwest  reqwest     hyperhyper_full       hyper     hypertide_surf         surf      tidewarp_surf         surf      warpПри проведении анализа данных мы использовали cargo-bloat для оценки веса каждой зависимости в конечном двоичном коде. Он не даёт 100% точности, тем не менее, он проясняет «неизвестные» части в двоичном коде (обозначенные как крейт с именем «[Unknown]»). В наших сценариях использования их всегда было небольшое количество.Для всех проектов мы также протестировали несколько различных флагов компиляции, чтобы проверить возможность оптимизации размера двоичного кода. В следующей таблице показаны все задействованные параметры:Параметр                                  ЗначенияОптимизация                               [0; 1; 2; 3; s; z]Оптимизация во время компоновки           [thin; fat]Модули кодогенерации                      [1; 16]Мы создали интерактивную информационную панель для отображения интерактивных графиков, используемых в приложении shinyapp. В этом приложении вы можете более детально просмотреть все собранные нами данные. Давайте посмотрим на самые важные.Начинаем разбор результатов со сравнения между actix-reqwest и actix-full, первыми участниками нашего тестирования. Даже с усовершенствованной оптимизацией контекст, который мы настроили для тестирования размеров двоичного кода, всё равно показывает преимущество reqwest над awc.Сравнение awc с reqwest (интерактивный график).Ещё один важный момент, который мы хотели бы подчеркнуть: модель микрозависимости, которой отдаётся предпочтение в Rust, не слишком сильно влияет на размер двоичного кода. На следующей диаграмме мы показываем распределение по размерам всех крейтов, используемых во всех платформах-участниках нашего тестирования. Эта блочная диаграмма указывает на то, что большинство крейтов вносит очень незначительный вклад в общий размер двоичного кода и что на самом деле за его увеличение ответственны несколько более крупных крейтов:Распределение крейтов по размерам во всех проектах (интерактивная диаграмма).Пока мы тестировали флаги оптимизации, никаких сюрпризов не возникло. Установка уровня оптимизации на z, оптимизации во время компоновки на fat и количества модулей кодогенерации на 1 привела к улучшению результатов у всех участников тестирования. На следующей диаграмме показана оптимизация у tide-surf:Параметры оптимизации у tide-surf (интерактивная диаграмма).async-std и tide-surf — наша новая пара HTTP клиент-сервер для встроенных приложений. Несмотря на наличие высокоуровневого API, у этой пары результаты оказались лучше, чем у более низкоуровневых API, таких как hyper_full.Если бы мы выбирали пару, полностью основанную на tokio, ещё одной основной среде выполнения для асинхронной экосистемы rust, мы безусловно остановились бы на warp. Оказалось, что у этого крейта небольшой по сравнению с hyper расход вычислительных ресурсов в виде увеличения размера двоичного кода. Причём такой расход обусловлен созданием HTTP-серверов с гораздо более простым API.Размер всех проектов (интерактивная диаграмма).Если хотите быть в курсе будущих обновлений нашего тестирования, обязательно следите за репозиторием на GitHub. Для отслеживания изменений результатов во времени будут использоваться теги версий.

N/A,https://medium.com/@suprabhasupi/how-to-build-blog-using-gatsby-fcf6e5ff1f63?source=tag_archive---------21-----------------------,"Web Development,Beginner,Gatsbyjs,Tutorial,JavaScript","What is Gatsby? 🤔Gatsby is a React based, GraphQL powered, static site generator.It uses powerful pre-configuration to build a website that uses only static files for incredibly fast page loads, service workers, code splitting, server-side rendering, intelligent image loading, asset optimization, and data prefetching.Contents 🔥Create New PageGatsby LinkStyle the pageAdding Meta Tags to PageMDXWorking with ImagesImage OptimizationAdding Images to MDX postsSyntax HighlightAnalysing Bundle SizeBuild WebsiteWhat makes Gatsby special? 😲The way Gatsby uses GraphQL to build it’s data layer. Gatsby is made to collect your data from wherever it may be: Markdown, JSON, your favourite CMS, third party APIs, anywhere! And at build time, it creates an internal GraphQL server of all of this data. So in your react components, all of your data is queried at build time from that same place, in the same way through GraphQL.Gatsby removed the boilerplate for getting started and deploying apps to the production.Gatsby deploying static assets, because its static you don’t have to worry about database access, server going down, etc.Once you are done with Gatsby unified query, you run the Gatsby build process which gives a folder of static assets. Then you can host up in any server like Netlify, S3, FTP.Once you hit the browser it rehydrate into a fully functional react app. So, you don’t just serve static sites, you are actually serving Progressive web app.Gatsby follows the PRPL pattern and other performance best practices. It generate only static assets(no server required).If you want to change or modify the webpack or babel, then you can do that. While modifying the webpack, you don’t have to modify full config, as Gatsby will take care of composing that together. Customise only what you need, no ejection required(ejecting entire app like maintaining everything).Let’s start creating Gatsby page 📄Lets clone this repo Gatsby Intro.Now, will go through the files:In package.json, you only need three dependencies to build Gatsby: gatsby, react, react-dom.In src, you have all the view code.In static, it will generate all static assets after building the page.To Run:$ npm install$ npm run developEnter the host http://localhost:8000 into browser.1. Create New Page 🆕In src/pages path, add new file named about.jsabout.js:import React from 'react'export default() => (<>    <div> About Me</div></>)As you know, the file name given as about.js, so you can simply navigate to about page as localhost:8000/aboutThere is no need to restart the server after creating pages, Just create a file and check in browser by hitting the new page url. As, Gatsby also supports hot reloading. 🥳2. Gatsby Link 🔗You can use anchor tag but while using anchor tag, it will reload the whole page (that’s not a good sign for performance). As we know, Gatsby generating React App, you have the ability to do dynamic routing.So Gatsby comes prepackaged with React Router.import React from 'react';import {Link} from 'gatsby'export default () => (    <>        <div>Homepage</div>        <Link to='/about'>About Us &rarr;</Link>    </>)3. Style The Page 🎨For styling, you can use any plugin like emotion, SASS, etc. I will be using SASS here.To setup SASS, follow this article4. Adding Meta tags to page 🔖When you want to reuse common pieces of data across the site (for example, your site title), you can store that data in siteMetadata.To add meta tags to page for increasing SEO performance, follow this article5️. MDXMDX is way to enable React component inside of mark down.Rendering Components in MDX:To render MDX in component, there is some dependencies which needs to install:$ npm i gatsby-plugin-mdx @mdx-js/mdx @mdx-js/reactOnce the plugin installed, you need to configure in gatsby-config.js.gatsby-config.js:plugins: [        'gatsby-plugin-sass',         'gatsby-plugin-react-helmet',          {            resolve: 'gatsby-plugin-mdx',            options: {                defaultLayouts: {                    default: require.resolve('./src/components/layout')                }            }          }          ]gatby-mdx requires little bit of configuration, like passing options. So writing in resolve.In options, we need to pass what layout you will be using for MDX.NOTE: This layout will be going to use across all the pages.After adding the above config, restart the server. And create a page team.mdx. As we added the mdx plugin, now it looks for mdx file in pages directory.team.mdx:# My teamWelcome to Our Team 😋Check localhost:8000/team, It will show the team page.How can you add react component in MDX file? 🤔We will be creating a wave component, where we will increase count on clicking button.wave.js:import React, {useState} from 'react'import './wave.scss'const Wave = () => {    const [waves, setWaves] = useState(0);    const label = `👋 ${waves} ${waves == 1 ? 'wave' : 'waves'}`;    return (        <button onClick={() => setWaves(waves+1)}>{label}</button>    )}export default WaveHow can we add component into mdx file? 😲team.md:import Wave from '../components/wave/wave'# Contact MeWelcome to contact page 🥳## You can wave to Me<Wave />Yeah, that’s it. Just need to import the component and add it to the place. 🤩Also, you can add JSX into MDX.NOTE: You need to have 4 line break to get the JSX keep the markdown parts inside 😐<div style = {{background: 'red'}}>// 1// 2## helloo// 3// 4</div>Build Blog using MDXCreating two post using mdx.hello-world.mdx:---title: ""Hello World!""slug: hello-worldauthor: Suprabha---This is my first blog post!Inside --- is called frontmatter.another-post.mdx:---title: Another Post!slug: another-postauthor: Suprabha---This is my second blog post!How do we get these posts into Gatsby view? 🤔Using gatsby-source-filesystem plugin, you will be getting into the data layer so you can access them into the page.$ npm i gatsby-source-filesystemgatsby-config.js: (into plugins){    resolve: 'gatsby-source-filesystem',    options: {        name: 'posts',        path: 'posts'    }}In above snippet, I have given path, so it will look only in posts folder. Its going to load anything it finds as parts of data layer in posts path.It will get the MDX files and transform those into GraphQL nodes.Now, we will query from the posts using GraphQL.In GraphQL, edge is describing the relationship and node is describing the data itself.(Only in Gatsby)You can find the all changes related to creating posts hereAfter showing list of post in homepage, once you click on any post, It will show 404 page.To resolve this, you need to configure gatsby node config in the root.gatsby-node.js:// gatsby give utility methods actions, graphql, reporter// reporter is gatsby console log exports.createPages = async ({actions, graphql, reporter}) => {    // passing only slug, so accg to page we will fetch the rest of the data    const result = await graphql(`        query {            allMdx {                nodes {                    frontmatter {                        slug                    }                }            }        }    `);        // check the error scenario    if(result.errors) {        reporter.panic(""failed to craete post"", result.errors)    }        // if there is no error then getting nodes into posts variable    const posts = result.data.allMdx.nodes        // need to iterarte through the posts so using forEach here    posts.forEach(post => {        actions.createPage({            path: post.frontmatter.slug,            component: require.resolve(""./src/templates/post/post.js""),            context: {                slug: `/${post.frontmatter.slug}`            }        });    });};In above snippet, you have something called context. To get the data in post.js you need to look context. You can get the context in Post component via pageContextpost.js:const PostTemplate = ({pageContext}) => (    <pre>{JSON.stringify(pageContext, null, 2)}</pre>)//output{    ""slug"": ""/hello-world/""}Now, you can use the data. In context you can also pass title, author, body but later it will be bit complex so just adding slug and will fetch the rest data using that slug.Whenever you change gatsby node, restart the server.Following code has been done here.To get the data in post preview page, you need to look into context. You will be doing query based on slug/url from context for all the data.post.js:import React from 'react'import {graphql} from 'gatsby'import {Link} from 'gatsby'import {MDXRenderer} from 'gatsby-plugin-mdx'import './post.scss'import Layout from '../../components/layout'export const query = graphql`    query($slug: String!) {        mdx(frontmatter: {slug: {eq: $slug}}) {            frontmatter {                title                author            }            body        }    }`// aboved query will return dataconst PostTemplate = ({data: {mdx: post }}) => (    <Layout className='post-wrapper'>        <h1>{post.frontmatter.title}</h1>        <p className='author'>Posted by author</p>        <MDXRenderer>{post.body}</MDXRenderer>        {/* <pre>{JSON.stringify(pageContext, null, 2)}</pre> */}        <Link to=""/"">&larr; back to all posts</Link>    </Layout>)export default PostTemplateIn above snippet, you can see that we are using MDXRenderer. When you check body of the query it will be in different form which you can not read(mixing of both MDX and JSX). By using MDXRenderer, you can able to render the body in right format.You can find all graphql operator here.6. Working With ImagesAdd the images into static folder which can be easily accessible.You can add image to homepage as:<div className='hero-bg'> </div>.hero-bg {    background-image: url('../../../static/images/banner.jpg');    height: 50vh;    background-position: top 40% center;    background-size: cover;}I have added the changes here.7. Image OptimisationFind the article here for Image optimization.8. Adding Images to MDX PostsYou can add the images into MDX posts via installing gatsby-image dependencies:$ npm i gatsby-imageIts same as gatsby-background-image but gatsby-image for regular images.post-preview.js:import Image from 'gatsby-image'<Image     className='post-image'    fluid={post.image.sharp.fluid}    alt={post.title}/>Note: You need to add image into the query, so you can able to fetch it in post data.To add it into the post data:import {graphql, useStaticQuery} from 'gatsby';const usePosts = () => {    const data = useStaticQuery(graphql`        query {            allMdx {            nodes {                frontmatter{                    title                    slug                    author                    image {                        sharp: childImageSharp {                            fluid(                                maxWidth: 200                                maxHeight: 200                                duotone: {shadow: ""#663399"", highlight: ""#ddbbff""}                            ) {                                ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid_withWebp                            }                        }                    }                }                excerpt            }            }        }    `)    return data.allMdx.nodes.map(post => ({        title: post.frontmatter.title,        slug: post.frontmatter.slug,        image: post.frontmatter.image,        author: post.frontmatter.author,        excerpt: post.excerpt    })    ) }export default usePostsIn above snippet, you added maxWidth, maxHeight and duoTone for defining size and duotone is for background color on blurred image.The duotone option, given two hex colors shadow and highlight defining start and end color of the duotone gradient, converts the source image colors to match a gradient color chosen based on each pixels relative luminance.You can find all the snippet hereAdding Optimized Image to PostsIf you want to show the image inline or in blog, you need to install one more plugin called gatsby-remark-images.hello-world.mdx:![First banner](./images/00-banner.jpg)Above snippet won’t work because Gatsby building all the files, and its doesn’t able to find the image path where we would expect them to be.$ npm i gatsby-remark-imagesRemark is a mark down parser that can converts markdown into HTML.gatsby-config.js:{    resolve: 'gatsby-plugin-mdx',    options: {        defaultLayouts: {            default: require.resolve('./src/components/layout')        },        gatsbyRemarkPlugins: ['gatsby-remark-images'],        plugins: ['gatsby-remark-images'],    }}Now, once you restart the server, the image will work 🙌🏻9. Syntax HighlightTo work on Syntax Highlight, Checkout the article here.10. Analyzing Bundle Size 🎒The last thing is to check the output, that the only thing which you have added should be there. To check that you will check bundle.To check that, you will be using gatsby-plugin-webpack-bundle-analyzer plugin$ npm i gatsby-plugin-webpack-bundle-analyzergatsby-config.js:{    resolve: 'gatsby-plugin-webpack-bundle-analyzer',    options: {        production: true,        disable: !process.env.ANALYZE_BUNDLE_SIZE,        generateStatsFile: true,        analyzerMode: 'static',    }}You want this plugin to run only on production bundle, then disable Should only run on some environment check.package.json:""scripts"": {    ""analyze"": ""ANALYZE_BUNDLE_SIZE=true gatsby build""}If you are using MACbook, then its fine. But if you are using windows, then add this script also add cross env dependencies.""scripts"": {    ""analyze"": ""cross-env ANALYZE_BUNDLE_SIZE=true gatsby build""}Once its done, run the analyze command in terminal$ npm run analyzeIt will redirect you to below page:In above snippet, you can see what’s the size of the bundle, what are the images you are using.If you are importing any lodash function then try to import it via lib, so it will download whole lodash function.You can find the full snippet here 😎11. Build Website ⛩Once you run build command:$ npm run buildIt will generate all static files into public folder.Then you can serve the page by below command:$ npm run serveAnd you can see build website on localhost:9000One more awesome thing, If you are in homepage and once you hover on menu about us link then it will prefetch the about us page data. So when you go to about us page, it will load very fast, 😍🤩 (file will be already available)I will be writing the artcile soon on how can we deploy Gatsby blog on Netlify 😍Cache Clean in Gatsby 🧹Adding the below script into package.json:""cache"": ""gatsby clean""Run it into terminal:$ npm run cacheReference 🧐Using Gatsby ImageGatsby Transformer sqipBuild a blog from scratch🌟 Twitter | 👩🏻‍💻 Suprabha.me | 🌟 InstagramWritten bySuprabha SupiFrontend Developer sharing JS, HTML, CSS, GoLang🔥 Find all on blog.suprabha.me💛Follow151 1 151 151 1 Web DevelopmentBeginnerGatsbyjsTutorialJavaScriptMore from Suprabha SupiFollowFrontend Developer sharing JS, HTML, CSS, GoLang🔥 Find all on blog.suprabha.me💛More From MediumHide files and folders in FinderDaniel RotärmelHow to convert latitude and longitude coordinates into pixel offsetsDmitriy SuverovWhat I’ve Learned Building 4 React Native Apps Over 3 YearsKyle Erickson in Input LifeHow to use Directives in AngularJohn Au-Yeung in JavaScript In Plain EnglishReact HooksJanae HallQuerying data — Mongo DbManish KumarThe Use of the JavaScript SemicolonDaniel Jung in Better ProgrammingClock-In/Out System Part 4: Basic Back End (III) — AppModuleCarlos Caballero in Better ProgrammingAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

Модифицируем часть программы, которая устанавливает ядро AVR, и добавляем другой код:# Установка ядер Arduinoarduino-cli core install arduino:avrarduino-cli core install arduino:samdДавайте также поменяем код для компиляции наших скетчей:# Компилируем все файлы с расширениями *.ino для Arduino Unofor f in {,**/}*.ino ; do    arduino-cli compile -b arduino:avr:uno $f    arduino-cli compile -b arduino:samd:arduino_zero_native $fdoneТак вы автоматически проверите код на разных платформах и увидите, появятся ли ошибки.Если добавить изменения и отправить их в репозиторий на GitHub, а потом перейти на вкладку Actions (Действия), то вы увидите свой новенький рабочий поток и его выходные данные:При нажатии на название сборки вы увидите что-то подобное:Если один из шагов закончится неудачно, вы можете нажать на его название и просмотреть подробную историю лога. Также будет полезно добавить дополнительный вывод скриптам оболочки, чтобы лучше понимать, что выполняется.Автоматизированные сборки PlatformIOСкрипт выше будет работать и для скетчей, и для библиотек Arduino со скетчами-образцами. Он не подходит для проектов PlatformIO. Для проектов такого типа рекомендуется создавать автоматизированные сборки с помощью интерфейса командной строки PlatformIO вместо аналога в Arduino.С таким подходом вы сделаете непрерывную интеграцию для любого типа проектов из PlatformIO, а не только для проектов из Arduino. И это его самое большое преимущество. В целом этапы схожи. Добавляем шаг в build.yml:…  steps:    - name: Checkout      uses: actions/checkout@v2- name: Build on PlatformIO      run: bash ci/build-platformio.shТеперь добавляем скрипт оболочки build-platformio.sh:MyPlatformIOProject├── .github│   └── workflows│       └── build.yml├── ci│   └── build-platformio.sh…А дальше следуем инструкции по установке PlatformIO:#!/bin/bash# Немедленный выход, если у команды не нулевой статусset -e# Переход в рабочее пространство githubcd $GITHUB_WORKSPACE# Устанавливаем PlatformIO CLIexport PATH=$PATH:~/.platformio/penv/bincurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/platformio/platformio-core-installer/master/get-platformio.py -o get-platformio.pypython3 get-platformio.pyТеперь устанавливаем платформы для тестирования:# Устанавливаем платформу Atmel AVRpio platform install ""atmelavr""Если вы корректно настроили platformio.ini, вам осталось пройти всего один шаг:# Компилируем проектpio runКак вариант — можно напрямую пойти в окружения, определённые в platformio.ini:# Компилируем проект для Unopio run -e unoВот и все. Процесс оказался ещё проще, чем при работе с Arduino CLI.Укрепляем красивый стиль форматирования кодаИнструмент clang-format (CF) помогает проверять код на соответствие определенным правилам стиля форматирования в программах на C или C++.Стилей программирования много — выбирайте тот, что вам ближе: LLVM, GNU, Google, Mozilla или Microsoft. Вы также можете настроить инструмент проверки CF, чтобы писать код в одном стиле. Просто выберите любой из них, если не можете решить. Наличие одного приоритетного стиля важнее, чем поиск идеального. Всегда можно изменить или переопределить его позже, а всю базу кода просто переформатировать.Если вы работаете в VSC, вы можете добавить расширение, чтобы форматировать код при каждом сохранении файла. Тогда у вас больше не будет повода волноваться об этом. Все будет автоматизировано. Для других редакторов доступны похожие плагины. Я предлагаю добавлять в проект файл .clang-format:MyArduinoLibrary├── .clang-format…Выберите основной стиль и конфигурируйте его в файле вместе с вашими конфигурационными опциями. Вот как выглядит мой .clang-format:BasedOnStyle: GoogleLanguage: CppIndentWidth: 4AlignConsecutiveMacros: trueНе стесняйтесь изучать остальные возможности clang-format. У этого инструмента есть что предложить.После добавления CF в проект вы также можете интегрировать его в свой конвейер сборок, чтобы проверить правильность форматирования в базе кода.Чтобы этого достичь, создаём новый шаг Check clang-format conformity в файле build.yml. Предлагаю добавить его прямо после шага проверки (Checkout):…  steps:    - name: Checkout      uses: actions/checkout@v2- name: Check clang-format conformity      run: bash ci/clang-lint.sh- name: Build on Arduino CLI      run: bash ci/build-arduino.shТак запускается скрипт оболочки clang-lint.sh. Добавляем в файл несколько строчек для установки clang-format:#!/bin/bash# Немедленный выход, если у команды не нулевой статусset -e# Включаем опцию оболочки globstarshopt -s globstar# Переходим в рабочее пространство githubcd $GITHUB_WORKSPACE# Устанавливаем clang-formatsudo apt-get -y install clang-format-10Теперь делаем цикл по всем исходным файлам с кодом. Проверяем, правильно ли отформатировано их содержимое:# Проверка вывода clang-formatfor f in {,**/}*.{h,c,hpp,cpp,ino} ; do    if [ -f ""$f"" ]; then        diff $f <(clang-format -assume-filename=main.cpp $f) 1>&2    fidoneЗдесь есть одна главная строчка:diff $f <(clang-format -assume-filename=main.cpp $f) 1>&2Она запускает работу CF над файлом и сравнивает вывод с текущим содержимым файла. Если они одинаковые, значит файл отформатирован правильно. Если они отличаются, значит цель ещё не достигнута.Вывод команды diff перенаправляется в stderr, а это значит, что любой вывод считается ошибочным. Если файл отформатирован правильно, у diff не будет вывода и не будет ошибок. Если вывод сборки будет неудачным, то вы увидите неверно форматированные строчки кода.Очень рекомендую добавлять какой-либо вывод прямо после команды diff, чтобы лучше понимать, какие файлы проверяются. Например, вот так:echo ""Checking file ${f}""diff $f <(clang-format -assume-filename=main.cpp $f) 1>&2Если вы знаете как обойти скрипты оболочки, то на выходе конвейера сборок вы получите кое-что интересное:Мысли напоследокМы убедились, что начать пользоваться непрерывной интеграцией для своих собственных проектов довольно просто. А после выполнения базовой настройки вы сможете перенастраивать и переиспользовать этот инструмент еще и в других своих проектах.Если к конвейеру автоматизированных сборок добавить юнит-тесты, он станет ещё более мощным дополнением при работе над программами. Интеграция и того, и другого в ваш поток — это всего одна команда в скрипте: pio test.Вам решать, будет ли непрерывная интеграция улучшать ваш конкретный случай. Я советую серьезно рассмотреть этот вопрос, особенно когда вы будете делиться своим кодом и работать над проектом совместно с другими.Читайте также:Scrum мёртв.

Getting started with Node.js (Part 1: Intro to Node.js),https://medium.com/@ngyi/getting-started-with-node-js-part-1-intro-to-node-js-154561702e14?source=tag_archive---------24-----------------------,"Nodejs,Backend Development,Web Development,Software Development,Nodejs Development","IntroductionCheers! Congratulate on taking your first step. Yes, you reached this place, meaning you want to learn a new skill right? I know sometimes it could be difficult to learn a new thing, especially with so many resources all over the internet. It is overwhelming to you for sure because that’s how I feel when I first started. That’s why I am starting this series, ‘Getting started with Node.js’ to make it easier for people who wants to get into the Node.js circle. By the end of the series, you can expect to know how to create a server using Node.js that can serve the clients from all over the world. Interesting enough? Alright, enough talking. Let’s get started.What is Node.js?First of all, Node.js is not a programming language nor a framework. Quoted from the official Node.js website,Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engineWhat’t this? Confusing AF right? Just like me even after a few times reading it. No worries, in a simpler words, it means Node.js is something that allows us to write the server using JavaScript, which is not possible originally without it. This makes more sense huh?Why Node.js?Well. You might ask, there are tons of alternatives (eg, Java, Go, Php, …) to write server out there, why should I use JavaScript (Node.js)? Each of them has their own pros and cons. Therefore, it really depends on the use cases. The most significant advantage of Node.js is its ability at handling lots of Input/Output (I/O) operations. Some examples of I/O operations are read/write the database or file system. We won’t go into deeper about the internal design of Node.js on why it is so good at handling I/O, but if you are interested, you can check out this article anytime, Node.js Event Loop. In short, Node.js is a very great choice when developing an I/O intensive application or a real-time application.However, everything comes at a cost, the internal design on Node.js that allows it to handle I/O very fast also makes it not suitable for CPU-intensive tasks. Unlike other programming languages, JavaScript is single-threaded by nature. Therefore, any CPU-intensive task will block the only thread that it has and you know what happen next. Every requests that come afterward will have to wait for the server to finish processing that CPU-intensive task. For example, you should never run a machine learning model or a 1 million nested for loop directly on the thread.

Django,https://medium.com/@stacyshingleton/django-eb7ceba436bc?source=tag_archive---------26-----------------------,"Django,Web Development,Django Tutorial,Data Science","By the time I had completed my data science bootcamp, I was ready to take on statistical analysis, machine learning, data visualization, and so many other data challenges. And while I understood the basis of a webpage, HTML defining the content of a webpage and CSS defining the style of the webpage, I was far from understanding the process of web development. I knew this was gap in my portfolio, and I had already faced the need for building simple web applications. For instance, recently, I had the need to create a polling application which would allow users to define true labels for a classification data set. And consequently, my research began — how could a data scientist, with no web development experience, create a user friendly polling application? This was when I discovered Django.According to the documentation, “Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It’s free and open source.” Django allows users to quickly build applications as it provides the user with the common framework needed for web development. Django templates come standard with built in security measures to keep applications safe from a variety of attacks such as SQL injections, clickjacking or cross-site scripting (XSS). You can write tests which will identify bugs in your application as well as turn your projects into standalone Python packages that can be reused for new projects.The first step to building a Django application is installations, starting with Python. Because Django is a Python web framework, it will require Python to be installed first. The Python installation will include a lightweight database called SQLite — if you will be needing to work with a larger database engine, such as MySQL or Oracle, be sure to download it next. Finally, install Django by following these instructions.The next step is deciding on a tutorial to follow to get started. Ask yourself, what do I plan to use Django for? Some of the most popular tutorials walk the user through building applications for either a polling website, a blog, or a portfolio website, so chose a tutorial that builds an application that interests you, and/or meets your web development needs. I decided to follow the official Django tutorial which walked me through building a polling site. This tutorial includes 12 sections, starting at an overview of Django, going through detailed steps to to writing the application, and finishing with more advanced sections, including publishing and patches. The tutorial is long, very in depth, and will take a couple days to get through effectively. Make sure you set aside an appropriate amount of time for this tutorial, or any other Django tutorials, if you plan to truly grasp the concepts. There are plenty of Django tutorials to chose from, either in video form or as write ups, so take time in finding one that works for you. An advantage of a write up is being able to copy and paste the code, while an advantage of a video is is the ability to follow along with the instructor ‘live’. Some of the most popular tutorials I have found, other than the official documentation as linked above, are the following:Django Girls Tutorial, plus Videos (10 videos)The Net Ninja Tutorial (32 videos)Corey Schafer Tutorial (17 videos)After completing the Django tutorial, I had created a polling web application that collects information from animal fosters. From the admin home site, I am able to view recent changes made to the site, authentication and authorization groups, and the poll questions.Within the poll questions link, there is a list of all current questions within the application, as well as their publishing dates. You can filter the questions by date published or by the search bar.If you click on an individual question, that will bring you to the available choices for the question, and the votes that each choice has received.You can access, edit, add and delete these questions and choices within your terminal by running a shell connected to your backend, or by making these changes within your hosted server.Written byStacy ShingletonI am a data scientist, formally a traditional scientist, from the University of Texas.FollowDjangoWeb DevelopmentDjango TutorialData ScienceMore from Stacy ShingletonFollowI am a data scientist, formally a traditional scientist, from the University of Texas.More From MediumHow Should I Go About Commenting My Code?Timothy QuirkTezos Rust node: How to call the Tezos protocol from RustJuraj Selep in SimpleStakingWhy Do We Need Code and Functional CoverageMichael GreenHow To Deploy Your .NET Core App on an IIS ServerAgustinus Theodorus in Bina Nusantara IT DivisionRvalue references in C++Pranay Kumar in pranayaggarwal25Making Quizzes Using PythonIftekher MamunAvengers: Web Scraping, Entity Extraction and Network Graphs in PythonPearl in The StartupWhat Coding Bootcamp Students Do In A Typical DaySarah Daniels in The StartupAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Nuove funzionalità di debug in Angular Ivy,https://medium.com/@mastefano64/nuove-funzionalit%C3%A0-di-debug-in-angular-ivy-1ef99a8bdb83?source=tag_archive---------27-----------------------,"Angular,Typescript,JavaScript,Front End Development,Web Development","IntroduzioneAngular Ivy ha portato con se molte novità e miglioramenti; tra questi possiamo trovare: minore peso dei bundle generati ed un uso maggiore del tree-shaking, ottimizzazioni nel processo di compilazione, nuovi modi per effettuare il debug.Maggiori informazioni su Angular Ivy le potete trovare nel seguente articolo.In quest’articolo ci occuperemo soprattutto dei nuovi metodi per poter effettuare il debug di un applicazione Angular nella DevTools Console.Fino ad ora avevamo solo 2 possibilità: usare il debug presente in Visual Studio Code, usare il debug presente nella DevTools Console. Oltre a mettere nel codice dei “console.log()”.Ora nella Console dei DevTools abbiamo anche l’oggetto “ng” che ci permette di ispezionare un applicazione Angular, di visualizzare e modificare i valori di una proprietà di un componente, piuttosto che richiamare i metodi dello stesso.Da notare che ciò che verrà illustrato nel proseguo del presente articolo funzionerà solo in modalità di debug. In produzione non troveremo l’oggetto “ng”.Come funziona l’oggetto “ng” e quali metodi offre?Ma andiamo per ordine e guardiamo con attenzione l’immagine sottostante.Se clicchiamo su un componente all’interno del tab “elements” noteremo che compare il simbolo “$0”.Se invece ci spostiamo nella console e digitiamo “ng” vengono mostrati vari metodi: getComponent(), getContext(), getListeners(), etc.Proviamo ora ad unire entrambe le cose e digitiamo nella console: ng.getComponent($0).Come si può vedere vengono mostrate le proprietà ed i metodi del nostro componente. Questa è una funzionalità molto potente perché ci permette di modificare a caldo le proprietà e di richiamare i metodi (come anticipato poco sopra).Se invece proviamo a digitare: “ng.getHostElement($0)” noteremo che ci viene mostrato html generato dal template.Modifica di una proprietàProviamo ora a modificare una proprietà presente nel nostro componente, per esempio la proprietà “title”.Noteremo subito che, anche se abbiamo assegnato alla proprietà title il valore “Page X” la UI non viene aggiornata. Come mai?Questo accade perché da console la “change-detection” non scatta, dobbiamo essere noi ad avviare un ciclo di “change-detection” tramite il metodo: “ng.applyChange($0)”. A questo punto la UI viene magicamente aggiornata.Stesso discorso nel caso vengano richiamati metodi che modificano una proprietà, dobbiamo essere sempre noi ad invocare un ciclo di “change-detection”.Proviamo a richiamare un metodoNel nostro componente è presente un form con un paio di campi, troviamo inoltre un bottone mappato con il metodo “onSubmit()” che ci permette di recuperare i valori inseriti.Se vogliamo richiamare il metodo in modalità di debug basta digitare “c.onSubmit()”, se è presente un brekpoint nella corpo del metodo in questione, questo magicamente scatterà e vedremo i valori inseriti.ConclusioniQuesto piccolo esempio è un buon punto di partenza per iniziare a prendere confidenza con i metodi offerti dall’oggetto “ng”.Da notare che tutto ciò funziona solo in modalità debug. Non vedremo questi metodi se abbiamo compilato la nostra applicazione in modalità produzione.Se volete contattarmi il mio profilo Linkedin è il seguente: Stefano Marchisio: Consulente freelance Angular ASP.NET MVC C#Written byStefano MarchisioSono uno sviluppatore web full-stack: Angular / TypeScript e ASP.NET MVC CORE C# https://www.stefanomarchisio.it/Follow1 1 1 AngularTypescriptJavaScriptFront End DevelopmentWeb DevelopmentMore from Stefano MarchisioFollowSono uno sviluppatore web full-stack: Angular / TypeScript e ASP.NET MVC CORE C# https://www.stefanomarchisio.it/More From MediumWhy you should be using React FragmentsAaron S in JavaScript In Plain EnglishHow setting up unit tests with TypeScriptMatteo Tafani AlunnoWhy Factories are better than Classes in JavaScriptChris I. in JavaScript In Plain EnglishThe Making of a Portfolio SiteTabitha O'MelayDonald Trump Won, No Matter What Happens NextJessica Wildfire in The Apeiron BlogThe Election Should Never Have Been This Closeumair haque in Eudaimonia and Co20 Things Most People Learn Too Late In LifeNicolas Cole in Better Advice(Why) There Was no Biden Landslideumair haque in Eudaimonia and CoAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Creating a Web Portfolio,https://medium.com/@brennanbrown/creating-a-web-portfolio-f337008223bc?source=tag_archive---------28-----------------------,"Web Development,Marketing,Creativity","For web developers and other creative professionals, a great portfolio can make the difference between landing the job and getting passed over. Employers looking to fill a job opening want develop who can solve real-world challenges, be productive and creative team members, and hit the ground running.1. Understand Your AudienceFirst and foremost: It’s your prospective employer’s first impression of you. It’s the first thing they’ll look at beyond your intro letter and resume. And they’ll be looking to see if it’s worth their time to talk to you.Even the most impressive portfolio will fall flat if it doesn’t cater to its audience. Ask yourself what prospective employers need to know to make a hiring decision and do that.Prospective employers are busy people who are trying to get through the chore of hiring someone, so that they can get on with running their business and serving their customers.But they do want to see, as quickly and efficiently as possible, how you get results for them, and make them look good in the process.Sweat the details. Don’t settle for okay when you could do better. Optimize the heck out of it. Make sure the pages and images load quickly. Respect your prospective employer’s time and attention by giving them relevant info and anticipating their questions.Do this, and you show people that you care not only about how good your work looks, but how good your audience feels.Remember, employers care more about how much respect you show for their priorities, than how cutting edge technology or sparkly your designs look.There are four important questions you need to ask yourself when considering your audience:How would you describe your dream job in four sentences?When my ideal employers are trying to engage their audience, what’s the most important factor?What’s the greatest value you can create for your employer?What will make employers choose you over other applicants? How can you communicate that?2. Convey Your PersonalityEmployers are, of course, looking for someone who can meet their needs and understand their market, but they also want to know who you are.The perfect job isn’t just a good outlet for your skill set and your work experience, it’s also a position where you communicate well with your team, so let them see enough of your personality that they can get a sense of whether they’ll be able to connect with you.Don’t be afraid to show who you really are. People are naturally inclined to authenticity. They can sense it from a mile away, even through a computer screen.What are your strengths?Visual Thinking: Perhaps you love to doodle during meetings and think visually, so what could you do with your portfolio to let some of that shine through? Hand-drawn graphics convey a lot of personality.Humorous Prose: Perhaps you like to make your teammates laugh. By all means, allow that to infuse your writing.Information Analysis: If you’re a real info junkie, consider highlighting some key facts and figures using an infographic for each portfolio piece.Here are a few questions to consider as you’re looking for ways to infuse your personality into your portfolio:“What part of my work do I love best?”“What kind of stuff could I do all day and never get bored?”“What do I need to experience in order to feel like a project is a success?”“What do my clients and colleagues thank me for?”Where do you want to go?:What are your career goals?What’s your dream job?What do you see yourself doing professionally in the near or more distant future?If your ideal career path doesn’t include a certain kind of work that you have performed in the past, there’s not much benefit including that kind of work in your portfolio because it sends mixed messages to prospective employers about where they might slot you into their team.Focus as much as you can on the projects you were paid for and be sure to include as much of that real-world experience as possible.3. Express Design ThinkingGood design solves problems. It’s not just decoration that is making things pretty, especially when we’re talking about commercial web development.There are specific goals your client wants to reach. Your job is to support them in meeting those goals. Employers aren’t just looking for people with a good eye, they’re looking for people who know how to solve problems.It’s much easier to train someone on technical skills than it is to to train them on becoming a better listener or problem solver.Show your work! That is, walk people through the steps of how you arrived at your final design concepts. Employers want to see not just the final result, but how you got there.When you outline the goals of the project and how you went about achieving them, you show employers that you know how to focus on the client’s priorities, and that your approach can be tailored to each project.Potential employers can peek into your creative process and answer questions like:How original were your original concepts?What sorts of directions did you consider?By showing them that you’re capable of coming up with several different concepts or approaches, you say a lot about the depths of your creative resources.A benefit of the show your work approach is that it shows the inner details of your work process:When do you like to gather feedback?How do you incorporate that input?Are you the kind of designer who sketches a whole bunch of ideas on the back of a napkin before refining your concepts, or do you prefer to go straight to digital?Are you a content-first kind of person, or do you start with a strong visual? What kind of research do you typically do?Do you thrive on collaboration, or are you more of an introvert?The answers to these questions convey a lot of information to a prospective employer right off the bat.When you let them see how you work, not just the final polished product, you’re giving them great insight into what it might actually be like to work with you. And you don’t have to limit showing your work to the stuff that made the final cut either.Paths Not Taken: If there were some initial ideas or concepts that you rejected, you might consider including some of those in your portfolio.Rejected concepts actually provide a lot of insight, both into your creative mind, and also into your problem-solving process. You can explain what you liked and didn’t like about them, what you thought worked and what didn’t. You can talk about how they were received by your colleagues and clients.All of this is another way of showing your work because it demonstrates not only that you’re open to trying things that might not succeed, and also that you’re open to learning from those mistakes and collaborating to create something that’s more effective.Write about any elements of these early designs that you ended up incorporating into later concepts. This is a way to show that you care enough to keep improving and aren’t content just to go with the first good idea that comes into your head.4. Demonstrate Your RangeShow prospective employers that you’re flexible, creative, and adaptable to different kinds of projects, styles, audiences and brands. The bottom line here for prospective employers is this:“Convince me that if I do hire you, that you can then handle anything I throw at you.”They want to know that you’re going to be valuable to them beyond a single project, that you’ll continue to generate creative solutions and fresh visuals time and time again.Beyond what languages and technologies you’re showcasing your abilities with, range also includes the types of clients you choose to represent in your portfolio so be sure to include projects from a cross section of client types, sizes, and industries whenever possible.When employers, particularly agencies who are vying for contracts with different types of clients, are looking for developers, they’re going to be most interested in hiring someone who’s comfortable working with a wide range of clients and producing a wide range of deliverables.At the same time, don’t be shy about paring your portfolio down to the projects either, in order to demonstrate the greatest contrast possible. Select your portfolio project with a critical eye, and make sure they don’t look too similar.Written byBrennan Kenneth BrownWriter on Medium for more than 4 years, focusing on happiness, productivity, and technology.

Programador! Tenho tempo?,https://medium.com/@Tecmartins/programador-tenho-tempo-58e1f511298f?source=tag_archive---------29-----------------------,"Python,Machine Learning,JavaScript,Web Development,Data Science","Crise econômica, pandemia, crise financeira, mais crise econômica… e me vejo sem emprego. Bom momento para se fazer uma reviravolta na vida profissional, não é? Cursos de atualização ou mesmo para mudar de área abraçando algo que sempre sonhou fazer.Ótimo se você tem por volta de quarenta anos. Mais maduro, com rica experiência de vida acumulada e com tempo para se dedicar a uma nova ‘corrida’ profissional, onde largamos como estagiários e chegamos como super e valorizados seniors.Um profissional deste deve ser visto com bons olhos. Será uma pessoa que sabe o que quer e onde deseja chegar. A bagagem profissional que pode ser aproveitada depende da área trabalhada, passada e futura, mas agregará aquelas peculiaridades de trabalho em empresa e em grupo que se demora para obter e que refletirão na produtividade.Falo daquele senso de urgência, do comprometimento com metas, com administração de conflitos interpessoais, responsabilidade, fidelidade à superiores e tantos outros aspectos presentes no dia a dia das empresas.Um profissional destes virá com uma determinação e objetividade que um jovem não terá no princípio de carreira. Vantagem importante.Mas falemos das desvantagens.Um jovem vem como um quadro em branco e pode ser moldado conforme as necessidades da empresa. Certo?Pessoalmente, acredito mais que uma pessoa com experiência profissional será muito mais capaz de entender o que se espera dele e de seu trabalho. Já lidou com isso e inclusive pode ter tido superiores que apontavam para caminhos distintos e que teve que compreender e aplicar.O jovem tem mais capacidade de aprendizagem rápida. Confere?Pode ser. Mentes novas possuem realmente a capacidade de absorver mais informação, são programadas para aprender dizem os estudos científicos. Todavia, a experiência e a capacidade de achar atalhos devem ser contraposta em comparação.Para encurtar, dou minha opinião: acho que a mescla de pessoas de variadas idades é o melhor, seja pelos motivos apresentados, seja por outros que poderiam ser facilmente levantados.Meu caso é um pouco diferente. Tenho me dedicado profundamente a aprendizagem de novas linguagens e ferramentas de programação. Adquiri conhecimentos em Python, JavaScript, Machine Learning,… acima dos exigidos de programadores juniores e tenho experiência em programação há mais tempo em outras linguagens. Contudo não tenho tido sucesso na busca de oportunidades.O que está pegando?Difícil de dizer, obviamente, mas detecto o seguinte problema. Sou um engenheiro eletricista com grande experiência em automação industrial sem muita dificuldade de se recolocar no mercado neste ramo com salário que pode ser até 3 ou 4 vezes maiores que o oferecido para um iniciante em programação. Temo que os recrutadores receiem fazer uma oferta desta ordem.Este seria o primeiro problema, mas há outros que não sei dizer se são reais ou fruto de minha imaginação. Todos eles ligados direta ou indiretamente a minha idade. Este candidato se submeteria a chefia de uma pessoa mais jovem? Qual a capacidade de aprendizado dele? Como ele se acomodaria em um time de pessoas bem mais jovens? Por que, afinal, ele não continua a área dele ganhando muito mais do que podemos oferecer?Estas são algumas questões que passam pela minha mente, mas não desisto. Continuo com estudos e começo a realizar projetos próprios para ter o que mostrar, afinal.Ainda assim, como já passei bem dos quarenta, às vezes me pergunto: Tenho tempo?Written byClaudiney MartinsEngenheiro eletricista que adora programação e por isso trabalhando em uma mudança de rumo profissionalFollowPythonMachine LearningJavaScriptWeb DevelopmentData ScienceMore from Claudiney MartinsFollowEngenheiro eletricista que adora programação e por isso trabalhando em uma mudança de rumo profissionalMore From MediumJukeBox by OpenAI.Vlad Alex (Merzmensch) in Towards Data Science5 Fun APIs for Your Next JavaScript ProjectsMehdi Aoussiad in JavaScript In Plain EnglishUsing Voice Commands In ReactAidan McBrideSupercharge your Python String with TextBlobKhuyen Tran in Towards Data Sciencemap(), filter() and reduce() in JavaScript.aditya dhanraj tiwari in codeburstUsing Machine Learning to Reduce Energy-Related Carbon Emissions from BuildingsMalavika UnnikrishnanHow to Write Better React CodeCaelin SutchHow setting up unit tests with TypeScriptMatteo Tafani AlunnoAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Four CSS Widgets for (Somewhat) Easy Interactivity,https://medium.com/@jrmartinez3d/four-css-widgets-for-somewhat-easy-interactivity-5697f1fdcfe9?source=tag_archive---------30-----------------------,"CSS,Programming,Web Development","For folks starting out with CSS, making complex animated page elements can be a daunting task. But, if you want to add some quick and simple interactivity to your webpage, here are four CSS widgets that rely only on hover and transition duration, rather than on hard-coded animations.You can see all these ideas illustrated at the link below:https://codepen.io/jrmartinez91/pen/abNNWGvThe General IdeaYou might think that a CSS hover animation is as straightforward as attaching the hover pseudoclass to the element you want to animate — but this can cause one pretty big problem: if the element changes shape or moves such that the cursor isn’t actually hovering over it anymore, the animation begins to reverse, and gets stuck in a loop until the cursor is moved.But, there’s an easy fix: attach the hover pseudoclass to a parent element, but have that element’s hover state only change the properties of its children.Expanding TextTo start off, here’s a setup that will make the distance between letters in a line expand and contract when the cursor is over it.HTML:<div class=""exp-text-wrapper"">  <p>Expanding Text</p></div><div class=""exp-text-wrapper"">  <p>Several Lines</p>  <p>That Contain</p>  <p>Expanding Text</p></div><div class=""exp-text-wrapper"">  <p>A Line that wraps awkwardly because it is too long</p></div>CSS:.exp-text-wrapper{  background:black;}.exp-text-wrapper p{  letter-spacing: 0.1em;  transition-duration: 1s;}.exp-text-wrapper:hover p{  letter-spacing: 1em;  transition-duration: 0.4s;}You can also get a pretty cool visual effect by having different expansion animations triggered by the same event, but running at different speeds.HTML:<div class=""bloom-text"">  <p class=""bloom1"">Slowly</p>  <p class=""bloom2"">Leisurely</p>  <p class=""bloom3"">Sprightly</p>  <p class=""bloom4"">Rapidly</p></div>CSS:.bloom1{  transition-duration: 5s;}.bloom2{  transition-duration: 3s;}.bloom3{  transition-duration: 1s;}.bloom4{  transition-duration: 0.5s;}.bloom-text p{  letter-spacing:0em;}.bloom-text:hover p{  letter-spacing:1em;}Flipping CardsOK so when I said this was going to be simple I may have lied.Flipping cards is the most complex out of these four, thanks to the amount of specific categories it has to deal with.The trick here is that the ‘card’ being flipped is not a singular entity — it’s two elements in the exact same spot on the page. These two elements are designated ‘card-front’ and ‘card-back.’ Both of them have invisible backfaces, and one of them is flipped 180 degrees by default, and only switches back to 0 degrees when the parent element is being hovered over.HTML:<div class=""card-frame"">  <div class=""card-front"">    <p>FRONT</p>  </div>  <div class=""card-back"">    <p>BACK</p>  </div></div>  <div class=""card-frame"">  <div class=""card-front-vertical"">    <p>FRONT</p>  </div>  <div class=""card-back-vertical"">    <p>BACK</p>  </div></div>CSS:.card-wrapper{  min-height:120px;}.wrapper{  display:flex;  justify-content: space-evenly;}.card-frame{  height:100px;  width:100px;  margin: 0 auto;}.card-frame .card-back{  transform: rotateY(180deg);  transition-duration: 1s;  position:absolute;  backface-visibility:hidden;  width:100px;  height:100px;  background-color:red;}.card-frame .card-front{  transition-duration:1s;  position:absolute;  backface-visibility:hidden;  width:100px;  height:100px;  background-color:blue;}.card-frame:hover .card-front{  transform: rotateY(180deg);}.card-frame:hover .card-back{  transform: rotateY(0deg);}.card-front, .card-back{  border: 1px solid white;}Blurring ShadowsThe key to the blurring shadows effect is to create multiple elements with the same text, and use position:absolute to force them to occupy the same space on the page. The advantage of this approach is that it makes the shadows much much more opaque — CSS’s default text-shadow can be very hard to see, especially when blurred more than a few pixels.HTML:HTML:<div class=""wrapper""><div class=""blur-shadow"">  <div class=""shadow-text-wrapper"">    <p class=""shadow-text"">Blurring Shadows</p>  </div>  <div class=""shadow-text-wrapper"">    <p class=""shadow-text"">Blurring Shadows</p>  </div>  <div class=""shadow-text-wrapper"">    <p class=""shadow-text"">Blurring Shadows</p>  </div>  <div class=""shadow-text-wrapper"">    <p class=""shadow-text"">Blurring Shadows</p>  </div>  <div class=""shadow-text-wrapper"">    <p>Blurring Shadows</p>  </div></div></div>CSS:.blur-shadow{  height: 50px;  width: 100px;}.shadow-text{  color: transparent;}.shadow-text-wrapper{  position:absolute;}.blur-shadow .shadow-text{  text-shadow: 0px 0px 0px black;  transition-duration:1s;}.blur-shadow:hover .shadow-text{  text-shadow: 0px 0px 10px black;}Dropdown BoxAt first glance the solution here seems as simple as changing the height or visibility of an element — but the snag there is that even if a div’s height or width is set to 0, the text inside is still visible. It starts to slide outside the div, while staying anchored to one point or another on it, which creates an awkward sliding effect. So, instead of changing the size of the div, we can use clip-path to change what portion of it is visible.HTML:<div class=""dropdown-wrapper"">  <div class=""upper-box"">    <p>Dropdown</p>  </div>  <div class=""dropdown"">    <p>Content of the Dropdown Box</p>  </div></div>CSS:.dropdown-wrapper{  background-color:black;}.upper-box{  background-color:olive;  margin-bottom:5px;}.upper-box p{  margin:0;}.dropdown{  background-color:olive;  clip-path:polygon(0 0,100% 0,100% 0,0 0);/*   height: 0; */  transition-duration: 0.5s;}.dropdown-wrapper:hover .dropdown{  clip-path:polygon(0 0,100% 0,100% 100%,0 100%);}Written byJames MartinezFollow30 30 30 CSSProgrammingWeb DevelopmentMore from James MartinezFollowMore From MediumA Simple Spreadsheet Error That Could Kill People Over the Coming WeeksCarl Nixon in The StartupRust’s struct update syntax made simpleDylan Kerler in The StartupCRUD functions with Node.js and AWS dynamoDBMaeluenieFlutter Thursday 01: App DashboardShuaib AfegbuaGo: WorkspacesChris Kakos in The StartupAPI Documentation Maturity — How Do Your Docs Stack up?Erikka Innes in The StartupWeb Scraping E-commerce sites using Selenium & PythonChayan Bhattacharya in Analytics VidhyaTweaking your UI automation logsMartin Schneider in FAUNAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

Also, we used media quires to make this navbar mobile-friendly.Make it yours now by using it, downloading it, and please share it.Source Code HereOriginally published at https://w3hubs.com on August 15, 2020.Written byw3hubsWe provide awesome user-interface using bootstrap, material design, angular material, angular, expressjs, pure css, responsive design, etc. wih free source codeFollowCSSWebWeb DevelopmentWeb DesignW3hubsMore from w3hubsFollowWe provide awesome user-interface using bootstrap, material design, angular material, angular, expressjs, pure css, responsive design, etc. wih free source codeMore From MediumHow recursion works in JavaScriptJared Nutt in JavaScript In Plain EnglishWhat are JavaScript Arrays?Alex Richards in JavaScript In Plain EnglishAngular: Organizing Features and ModulesJoao Aguas in The StartupWriting Your Very First Neural Network in JavaScriptFerenc Almasi in JavaScript In Plain EnglishTwitter Coding Interview QuestionsTrung Anh Dang in JavaScript In Plain EnglishPrivate and Public Routes with React Router.Thinley Norbu in WesionaryTEAMCross-App Bundling — A Different Approach for Micro FrontendsTobias Uhlig in The StartupAn Introduction to React Testing Library and Test Driven DevelopmentSteven Parsons in Dev GeniusAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Web Development: A Beginners Guide — Lesson 2: Tools of the Trade,https://medium.com/@machooper9/welcome-back-11cf292457d6?source=tag_archive---------32-----------------------,"Web Development,Website,Development,HTML,Programming","Welcome Back if you missed the 1st post, find it here Web Development — Beginners Guide: Part 1In the previous lesson we covered what a website is and the languages used to create one. In this lesson we will start to explore the tools you will be using to create some wonderful websites.Command LineBefore you run away thinking “I don’t know how the command line works”The terminal is not something hidden behind the scary door, it may seem that way at first but it is not.spend five minutes in the terminal playing around with the basic commands such as `cd` to change directory and `touch {file.txt}` to create a new txt file.note: the {file.txt} should be replaced with the name and extension of the file you are creating. for example ‘touch hello.txt’ will create a text file named hello.Lets start with the Terminal or Command Prompt. If you are on Linux or MacOS this will be the Terminal, which you can open by clicking on the icon, or on Mac by pressing `CMD + Space` to open spotlight and typing `Terminal` most Linux distributions have a shortcut like `CTRL + ALT + T` or `SUPER + T` note: super is the Windows Key.A lot of developers like to use a terminal replacement app such as iTerm or Hyper. I prefer to use the standard terminal that comes with my OS.If you are on Windows you can use `CMD.exe` or `Powershell` though I would recommend downloading Microsoft’s new Terminal App If you are still a little terminal shy, no need to fear I will make sure to include all the commands I run to setup a project in each tutorial so they are easy to follow along with.I will also have another post that will detail more advanced commands and perhaps one to teach you how to begin with shell scripting to automate processes, for now CD and Touch should suffice.Text EditorThis is one of the old aged debates, which text editor should you use? VSCode? Sublime? Notepad? Atom? Or maybe even vim?Notepad or other default text editors on Linux and Mac are great for starting a quick simple project to throw some HTML in and see what happens however managing files and projects with multiple folders and assets can become unwieldy.Let’s take a look at optionsVisual Studio CodeThat is why a Text Editor is recommended, if you are a Microsoft fan then by all means go for VSCode, I enjoy using it. It’s feature rich, built on Electron so it’s made with web technologies such as JavaScript anything you need it to do it’s able to thanks to extensions and you can theme it however you like. It has excellent git integration** note: We will cover git later, but in short it is a Version Control System, a life saver if you’ve made a change that breaks everything.Sublime TextSimilar to VSCode, except much older and it’s coded in C instead of Electron, this means it runs a little faster. It has a very similar theming system and the option to add plugins as well, many themes and plugins that are available for VS are also available for Sublime and Atom.AtomI used this for a little while and enjoyed it while I did however after moving to other text editor I can see a visible difference in speed. Nevertheless a feature packed text editor, described as a hackable text editor it has a plethora of options for you to change and tweak to your liking. Plus the icon is ridiculously cute.VimAh the famous/infamous vim, possibly the marmite of text editors, it’s notoriously difficult to start working with however renowned to be incredibly efficient and customizable. Also vim (or vi) is usually installed on most Linux Distrobutions, so if you will be working with a lot of servers then it’s handy to know the basics anyway. I have two ways of thinking with this editor, either wait until you understand the command line a little better before giving this a go, or just dive in feet first and learn it from the start. Another major upside of vim is how lightweight it is, on my MacBook it runs at 0.0% cpu usage when idle, and while testing with a bunch of emmet commands I managed to get it up to 1.24% but your mileage may vary.BracketsThe first text editor I installed, I learnt a lot of what I know about HTML and CSS using this editor. This editor introduced live preview to the text editor world allowing your browser window to reload as soon as you press save on a file, this made developing and making minor changes and bug fixes a dream.But which one?Honestly, it doesn’t matter all that much. You can argue over your favourite one and there are many othres including Caffeine for MacOS, which I have been considering trying for a while now and eMac’s which is comparable to vim. Really it’s down to you to test some of them and enjoy figuring out which you prefer. If you would like to see direct comparisons with user input see stackshare just google `stackshare vscode vs emacs` and it will bring up a nice comparison of features that each editor has and what users say each is good for.Web BrowserI won’t spend too long on this topic as you likely already have a favourite, just make sure you have an up to date web browser such as Chrome, Firefox, New Edge etc. as this will allow you to fully utilize new HTML, CSS and JS technologies as they are released.That’s all you actually need to start web development. There are many other tools that will make things quicker but I would highly recommend learning with just a text editor web browser and the default terminal application.Thanks for reading lesson 2!

HTML-Introduction: Global Structure:Part 1,https://medium.com/@rajatsilwal99/html-introduction-global-structure-part-1-cec20803724d?source=tag_archive---------33-----------------------,"Html5,Web Development,Web Design,Programming,Introduction","Previously we took a tour diving deeper into the history of HTML. Today we will learn about the global structure of an HTML page which will contain our content.How that you must have attained an understanding of what HTML is, its time to learn about some HTML tags. If you still want to take a detour go ahead and click here.Here we are going to learn about tags that deal with the global structure of HTML documents.Now here I have the browser Google Chrome open, but you can go and use whatever browser you feel comfortable in, and I here we will create a new HTML document in the text editor. I am using Sublime Text to code my HTML files, but you can use whatever text editor you would like, there are plenty of text editors out there, some are listed below go ahead and download the compatible version of text editor you like.AtomVisual Studio Code(My personal favorite)BracketsSublimeNow first, we will be creating what’s called a doctype, and to do that, we’ll go ahead and open HTML tags, we’ll put an exclamation point inside, we’ll type out the word “doctype” followed by a scape, and then the letters HTML. This is what’s called a document type.now there are lots of different doctypes available for creating different types of HTML documents. However, this doctype is what’s called an HTML5 doctype. Here I will be talking about HTML4 tags but these HTML4 tags can still be used with HTML5.So now go ahead and save your document as “index.html”. Why “index.html”? The file name index.html is very common, and when you name something idex.html and put it in a folder on a web server the webserver will commonly direct to index.html directly and bypass any other file names. We’ll get into the file structure a little bit later on but for now, let’s move onto the HTML tag.So now just skip down here a little bit and we’ll type and <HTML>(HTML tag) and inside the tag, we’re going to use what’s called an “attribute”. So we’ll type the word lang for language, an equal sign(“=”), and inside quotes, we’re going to put “en” for English. Now go ahead and close the HTML tag. The HTML tag wraps the entire document and it’s where we’ll be putting all the rest of our tags. We’ve used the language attribute to specify the language of the page, which in this case will be English. Again, the HTML tag will wrap all the rest of your tags on your page but the doctype declaration should always be written outside the HTML tag and should always come first, it’s a very special tag. refer to the image below.Next, we’ll go ahead and include a meta tag.SO we’ll type out the word meta, and again, we’re going to go ahead and use an attribute. In this case, we’re going to use a “charset” attribute followed by an “=” sign, then double quotes, and we’re going to go ahead and type “utf-8”. Charset means character set, and in this case, we’re using the character set “utf-8”, and this is the character set you’ll want to use 99% of the time you’re creating websites. refer to the code below.If you are using a different character set, you will probably have a very specific reason for doing so, and you probably know why. The character set meta-information is an option but just like setting the language to English, it’s a good idea to include. So we’ll go ahead and save that.You’ll notice that the meta tag is very similar to the doctype tag in that it doesn’t have a closing tag to pair with it. That’s because the meta tag is what’s called a “void element”. There is no closing tag because there is nothing to put inside the meta tag. The content and the tags are the sameWe have covered most of the tags that we’ll need to create our global page structure, but there’s still a few more to learn. We’ll finish things up in the next one, till then Happy Learning…!!!Written byRajat silwalFollow1 1 1 Html5Web DevelopmentWeb DesignProgrammingIntroductionMore from Rajat silwalFollowMore From MediumPrinciples of object-oriented programming in Ruby: Classes and Objects.Julian Belmonte in Weekly WebtipsIntroduction to Data Science With PythonCan Adıyaman in Analytics VidhyaPython Tuples and Tuple MethodsMichael GalarnykThe Quick Guide to Understanding QuicksortSome Dude Says in The StartupHow to WITH:Philip Carrington in The Startupbatect: Build and Test Environments as Code — With a Python Sample Project.Sven BalnojanHow to Change PostgreSQL Server with Minimal DowntimeKeeyan NejadOrchestrating a Rails Docker Deployment in SwarmAl-Waleed Shihadeh in Better ProgrammingAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

4 Biggest Web Design Mistakes that you must Avoid,https://medium.com/@wemakeitlive/4-biggest-web-design-mistakes-that-you-must-avoid-df6548777b74?source=tag_archive---------36-----------------------,"Web Design,Website Design,Web Development","FreepikIn 2020, almost ninety percent of global businesses and brands are going online. The industry is now relying on a far more friendly and convincing approach through a user-friendly website. These websites are what make the business popular amongst the global community.Now, to launch a website on the internet, you need to design it first. Usually, businesses outsource web design to an expert company that is somewhat a reputed figure in the digital marketing business. However, there is always an uncertainty regarding the web design process. With years of studies, it has been confirmed that if a website is designed in a wrong way, the business is the only thing that will take the fall.If you are into web design and formulate a fantastic platform for any business or brand, you need to know the web design mistakes you have to avoid. So, let’s learn about the biggest mistakes in the web design of the 2020 web designing process.#1 Loading Of Irrelevant Contents on the WebsiteOne of the significant parts of web design is the loading of contents on various pages. Now, people always look for businesses that remain true to their words i.e., the purpose of the website must match with the meaning of the brand. However, in some instances, web designers include contents that aren’t relevant to the brand or the business.For example, you are designing a coffee dealer website, but mistakenly, you have included some details of the tea beverage. The latter one is indeed extra content that might cause the business to suffer from a pitfall.#2 The Navigation System through the Website Isn’t ClearOne of the most important things to remember while designing a website is its navigation. Usually, an entire website consists of a minimum of four pages like home page, contact, about us, and the service page. In each of these pages, there are more hyperlinks to other parts of the business. Now, if the navigation between these main pages and the sub-pages are clear and sharp, the entire web design will go in vain.#3 Page Loading Time Is SlowWhen a user searches for a website directly using the URL, the web pages will take a certain time to get loaded. If you are not using proper content or the pages take a lot of time to open, the user experience statistics of the site will simply see a deflating curve. So, as a web designer, you must be concerned about the website’s loading time and the web pages included.#4 Blank or Clustered Website PicturesqueRecently, a new concept of negative spacing has been introduced to web designers. However, some people either make the sites too barren or too clustered. If your web design reflects such a mess or a lack of elements, the results will be a disaster.Web designing can be a peril sometimes, especially when the professionals always are afraid of the slightest mistakes like that we discussed today. So, if you want to excel in this field and design some of the spectacular looking websites, you must keep these website design mistakes on your mind.Written byWe Make It LiveWeMakeIt.Live Your #1 White Label White Label SEO Solutions Provider, White Label WordPress Development, and White Label Graphic Design Services.Follow1 1 1 Web DesignWebsite DesignWeb DevelopmentMore from We Make It LiveFollowWeMakeIt.Live Your #1 White Label White Label SEO Solutions Provider, White Label WordPress Development, and White Label Graphic Design Services.More From MediumThe Holistic SprintPeter Barber in The StartupWhat These Rejected Designs Reveal About the Ones That Made ItAIGA Eye on Design in AIGA Eye on DesignThe future of Industrial Design: evolving how we designWhipsaw Inc.How I’ve Used Miro to Launch 5 Success Projects — Why I Love MiroDrew Teller in SkillUp EdSociety Is Unequal by DesignAshley Nicole in An Injustice!How should a UX designer plan for voice interaction?丹尼爾 Daniel in uxbreakfastHow to Deal with UncertaintyMartin Tomitsch in Design at SydneyApproaching Everyday Racism through Fiction in Co-Creation WorkshopsHillary CareyAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
the road to code,https://medium.com/@destinysetzer/the-road-to-code-36b4cf92a351?source=tag_archive---------37-----------------------,"Coding,Web Development","What do you find challenging about coding?Trying to solve a problem I don’t understand with tools I don’t quite understand….Sometimes I feel like I’m trying to dig a ditch with a butter knife. I often find that my initial understanding/ interpretation of a question is much different than my peers. But this is all part of learning to think like a programmer! I can definitely tell i’m getting better though.Learning to take breaks and step away from a problem you REALLY REALLY want to figure out is a challenge as well. Sometimes a little break is all you need to solve your problem.Talk about a project that disappointed you. What would you change?I think the most recent project to disappoint me was Dodgeball. It drives me nuts to arbitrarily add things ( in this case classes/properties canThrowBall…etc) and never use it! I usually can’t seem to let it go and spend a lot of time wondering what part of the project i’m not understanding…surely we wouldn’t add these things for no reason?! PSYCH!List three key things to consider when coding with SEO in mind.The Three PillarsTechnology: technical underpinnings of a website: HTML code, URL structure, HTTP status codes, XML sitemaps, etc.Relevance: content, title tags & meta descriptions, headlines, content structure, readability, topical focus, etc.Authority: links and citations, sending the right signals to search engines that your website is a trusted source.List five or more ways you could optimize a website to be as efficient and scalable as possible.1. Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN)A content delivery network is a set of web servers distributed across various geographical locations that provide web content to end users with regard to their location. When you host the website on a single server, all users requests are sent to the same hardware. For this reason, the time needed to process each request increases. On top of that, the load time increases when users are physically far from the server. With CDN, user requests are redirected to the nearest server. As a result, the content is delivered to a user quicker and a website works faster. This is a rather expensive, but quite effective way to optimize the load time.2. Move your website to a better hostThere are three possible types of hosting:Shared hostingVirtual Private Servers (VPS) hostingDedicated serverThe most popular type of hosting that is used all over the world is sharing hosting. That’s the cheapest way to get your site online in a short time and for a low fee. It’s essential to choose the fast web host to ensure better optimization. With shared hosting, you share CPU, disk space, and RAM with other sites that also use this server. This is the main reason why shared hosting isn’t as fast as VPS or a dedicated server.Virtual Private Servers and dedicated servers are much faster. VPS uses multiple servers for content distribution. Having VPS you share the server with its other users and have your own part of the virtual server where your configurations don’t influence other clients. If your website has the average traffic or you have the eCommerce site with traffic spikes in some periods, VPS will be the optimal solution for you.The most expensive hosting option is to use a dedicated server which can be your own physical server. In this case, you pay a server rent and hire a system administrator to maintain it.Another approach is to rent dedicated cloud resource from AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google, or other public cloud provider. Both approaches can also be combined into a hybrid cloud that we discussed recently. With dedicated servers, all resources belong only to you and you get the full control of it. Cloud infrastructures can also add unlimited and on-demand scalability under a number of packages.Serverless architecture is yet another option that removes maintenance and server set up procedures altogether. Consider reading our separate article covering serverless architecture specifics and benefits.3. Optimize the size of images on your websiteEveryone loves eye-catching images. In the case of successful eCommerce sites, images are the vital part. A lot of photos, images, graphics on your product pages improve engagement. The negative side of the image use is that they are usually large files that slow down a website.The best way to reduce the image size without compromising its quality is to compress images using such tools as ImageOptim, JPEGmini, or Kraken. The procedure may take a bit of time but it’s worth it. Another way to reduce the image size is to use the HTML responsive images <secret> and <size> attributes that adjust image size based on user display properties.4. Reduce the number of pluginsPlugins are common components of each website. They add specific features suggested by third parties. Unfortunately, the more plugins are installed, the more resources are needed to run them. As a result, the website works slower and also security issues can appear. As time passes, the number of plugins grows, while some of them may not be used anymore. We recommend checking out all the plugins you have installed and deleting unnecessary ones. First, run the performance tests on your page to find out which plugins are slowing down your website. Not only does the website speed depend on the number of installed plugins but also on their quality. Try to avoid plugins that load a lot of scripts and styles or generate a lot of database queries. The best solution is to keep only the necessary ones and ensure that they are kept up to date.5. Minimize the number of JavaScript and CSS filesIf your website contains a lot of JavaScript and CSS files, it leads to a large number of HTTP requests when your website visitors want to access particular files. These requests are treated individually by visitor’s browser and slow down the website work. If you reduce the number of JavaScript and CSS files this will undoubtedly speed up your website. Try to group all JavaScript into one and also do so with all CSS files. This will reduce the overall number of HTTP requests. There are a lot of tools to minify HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files quickly. For instance, you can use WillPeavy, Script Minifier, or Grunt tools.6. Use website cachingIn case there are a lot of users accessing the page at one time servers work slowly and need more time to deliver the web page to each user. Caching is the process of storing the current version of your website on the hosting and presenting this version until your website is updated. This means that the web page doesn’t render over and over again for each user.Cached web page doesn’t need to send database requests each time.The approaches to website caching depend on the platform your website is developed on. For WordPress for instance, you can use the following plugins: W3 Total Cache or W3 Super Cache. If you use VPS or a dedicated server, you can also set up caching under your general settings. In the case of the shared server, the website caching isn’t usually available.7. Implement Gzip CompressionGzip Compression is an effective way to reduce the size of files. It minimizes the HTTP requests and reduces the server response time. Gzip compresses the files before sending them to the browser. On the user side, a browser unzips the files and presents the contents. This method can work with all files on your website. You can enable Gzip on your website by adding some lines of the code or via a utility called gzip.8. Database optimization in CMSDatabase optimization is the an effective way to increase performance. If you use a content management system (CMS) packed with complex plugins, the database size increases and your website works slower. For instance, the WordPress CMS stores comments, blog posts, and other information that take up a lot of data storage. Each CMS requires its own optimization measures and also has a number of specific plugins. For WordPress, for example, you may consider WP-Optimize.9. Reduce the use of web fontsWeb fonts have become very popular in website design. Unfortunately, the use of web fonts has a negative impact on the speed of page rendering. Web fonts add extra HTTP requests to external resources. The following measures will help you reduce the size of web font traffic:Use modern formats WOFF2 for modern browsers;Include only those character sets that are used on the site;Choose only the needed stylesAustin Coding AcademyWritten byDestiny SetzerFull-Stack Web Developer studying at Austin Coding AcademyFollowCodingWeb DevelopmentMore from Destiny SetzerFollowFull-Stack Web Developer studying at Austin Coding AcademyMore From MediumDjango + GCP App Engine Deployment, the Proper Way.Ali Izzet Metin in The StartupSublime Text 3 TensorFlow GPU 1.13 Environment With RTX 2080 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTSRyan Greenhalgh in Better ProgrammingBlockchain Programming for New Developers — IIJesus NajeraCreate a Rust Client for ROS2 from Scratch.

At that time I was really working hard in building my site from the scratch. Also, I had a very hardcore Copywriting bootcamp for months!.So, I let myself a few hours of freetime each week for devouring or getting lost into the heap of books I had in my Kindle library.So, I was intended to read on persuasive psychology or how to convince or make random person to buy our shit!. So, I got a handful of titles through 3–4 hours battle on Google search.I had no expectation for this title and I didn’t read any of his previous title either. So, first few chapters are PURE rant on how companies, Socialmedia and ad agencies are mean and how does they exploiting people’s psychology.Yes, it’s lots of ramble and criticism on mainstream entertainment and marketing industry. Once I got deeper. it was an absolute gold mine!.The author have mentioned Steve Jobs and his Apple coupe of times to advocate how to be genuine and loyal to the clients.So, as he states. Numerous startups, fancy business models, even established companies like Yahoo either crumbles down into Bankruptcy or lose its glitter through the course of time.The author argues. one of the core reasons behind such failures are occured because of they only pitch on what they do and how they do. They doesn’t lay down strong foundation on why they do and how come they could serve their clients.So, this book is really a good read if you’re working on your startup business or want to concoct your business strategy.Head First HTML and CSS: A Learner’s Guide to Creating Standards-Based Web Pages by Elisabeth Robson & Elisabeth FreemanFinding a career around digital marketing or content creation has no way relation with coding or programming.

So, just give it a shot. You won’t regret it.Don’t Make Me Think by Steve KrugAn another book on web development. Yes, it would be quite insightful for web developers (especially if you’re into designing).But, this book has to offer you many profound insights and listed the philosophy and value of taking advantage of conventions.If you want your viewer to spend lot of time into your site, then paying attention for placement and UI layout is very mandatory.So, you will know about how to make a visitor (new visitor) feel comfortable with your site’s UI. So, this would be a great deal for web developers and avid bloggers as well.The Rudest Book Ever by Shwetabh Gangwarthis book is by a popular Indian Youtuber.

Week 2 React,https://medium.com/@adamthomas03/week-2-react-3454b320034a?source=tag_archive---------40-----------------------,"Web Development,Coding,Austin Coding Academy","Discuss in words something you learned in class today or this week. This week we learned a lot, but put simply we learned how to render list and forms in ReactWhat is the difference between state and props? In a React component, props are variables passed to it by its parent component. State on the other hand is still variables, but directly initialized and managed by the component. The state can be initialized by propsWhat is ReactDOM? What is the difference between ReactDOM and React? React is a library for creating user interfaces. ReactDOM is a library for web apps that lets you manipulate DOM, just like jquery but in react style. React native is a set of tools that lets you build mobile apps using JavaScript which then compile down to java.What is React.createClass? React. createClass allows you to generate component “classes.” Under the hood, your component class is using a bespoke class system implemented by React. With ES6, React allows you to implement component classes that use ES6 JavaScript classes. The end result is the same — you have a component class.Which (if there is) node library method could you use to solve the algorithm problem you solved last night in your pre-homework?

Using Multiple Chrome Profiles as a Web Developer,https://medium.com/@mralexlau/using-multiple-chrome-profiles-6e7396342416?source=tag_archive---------42-----------------------,"Web Development,Chrome,Productivity,Lifehacks,Life Hacking","One of the most beneficial changes I’ve made to my workflow in the past couple years is to use multiple profiles in chrome. What this does is allow you to run chrome for multiple users at the same time. Although I use chrome as my browser of choice, but this approach works in any browser which supports the notion of multiple profiles.You may be thinking, “Ok, that’s kind of nice — but I can already sign in to different gmail accounts within the same browser window. So what does this really buy me?” The real advantage to maintaining these profiles is that each profile gives you a separate, isolated chrome environment. That means that all of your bookmarks, history, chrome extensions, saved usernames, etc. all stay within the context of one profile.As a developer, this is immensely useful. I can have one profile linked to my personal email, and one linked to my work email. The work one has an uncluttered list of bookmarks that only pertain to work, remembers my test account usernames, only uses extensions that are relevant to work, and doesn’t auto-typeahead to sites like ‘Pandora’ when I am keying in a url.Ultimately what you’re doing by setting up multiple profiles is separating your concerns for how your browser experience is organized. By just having one chrome profile, it’s easy for browser data to get out of hand — especially with regard to having too many bookmarks and extensions. Adopting multiple profiles allows you to keep what’s most relevant at hand, without having to open different browsers at the same time.Written byAlex LauFollowWeb DevelopmentChromeProductivityLifehacksLife HackingMore from Alex LauFollowMore From MediumWhat is the CompilerBuddhika Chathuranga in RuntimeErrorFunctionally Anonymous: Lambda Expression in JavaLucas PenzeyMoog in The StartupWriting QGIS plugin using Python 3, a beginner’s guideAbhishek SinghIndexing vs Slicing in PythonIndhumathy Chelliah in Dev GeniusHow to Curb Your Smartphone Addiction to Improve Focus and ProductivityAnupam Chugh in Better ProgrammingDesigning Instagram’s New DMs, Using HTML CSSAbhishek Prasad in The StartupYou Only Need 20 Percent to Become an Effective DeveloperAphinya Dechalert in mad<hashmap>Go-kit Microservice Using MysqlSampathch in The StartupAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
nature vs nurture,https://medium.com/@scoggins-dev/nature-vs-nurture-68ca2c3c3004?source=tag_archive---------43-----------------------,"Coding,Web Development,Austin Coding Academy,Lubbock Coding Academy","How do you organize your code? What are some suggestions you find on the web?always use proper spacing and tabbing in your website files. use eslint+prettier+a popular style guide (which is a bit of a pain to set up but worth it). use emmet (an amazing extension that makes html formatting way easier and you should check out). use proper naming in your variables, classes, and #ids. this is crucial to maintaining any sort of coherence in a project. these should be enough to get anyone on the right track in terms of organization. at a certain point though, it’s time to stop worrying about organization and JUST CREATE SOMETHING.Can you describe your workflow when you create a web page or web app?i first create a repo on github.com in order to keep track of my progress and otherwise maintain the project in a professional manner.i then clone said project into my devfolder on my primary hard disk, and create my base files (e.g. [file].js and [file].html). this is also when i would init npm if the project requires package dependencies, and go through the process of configuring them.i then create a branch to begin work in, so that i can easily create an initial pull request which tracks all my commits.this is where i would get coding, i.e. create something.You can’t work out how to solve a coding problem, where do you find the answer? Why? How do you know?there’s a really cool website i like to reference from time to time when i need to search for something. it’s called (i know it sounds weird but just go with it) https://www.google.com. trust me, it’s worth binging.What problems have you solved that didn’t involve you coding?i do a mean crossword. wait, is that technically coding?Talk about your preferred development environment.

Ten random useful things in R that you might not know about,https://towardsdatascience.com/ten-random-useful-things-in-r-that-you-might-not-know-about-54b2044a3868?source=tag_archive---------44-----------------------,"Programming,Data Science,Analytics,Web Development,Software Development","Often I find myself telling my colleagues and fellow coders simple things that I use in R that really help me with the tasks that I need to progress on. These range from trivial shortcuts, to little known functions, to handy little tricks.Because the R ecosystem is so rich and constantly growing, people can often miss out on knowing about something that can really help them in a task that they have to complete. So I often get a surprised reaction from my audience along the lines of ‘I never knew about that!’.Here are ten things that make my life easier working in R. If you already know them all, sorry for wasting your reading time, and please consider adding a comment with something else that you find useful for the benefit of other readers.1. The switch functionI LOVE switch(). It’s basically a convenient shortening of an if statement that chooses its value according to the value of another variable. I find it particularly useful when I am writing code that needs to load a different dataset according to a prior choice you make. For example, if you have a variable called animal and you want to load a different set of data according to whether animal is a dog, cat or rabbit you might write this:data <- read.csv(  switch(animal,          ""dog"" = ""dogdata.csv"",          ""cat"" = ""catdata.csv"",         ""rabbit"" = ""rabbitdata.csv""))This is particularly useful in Shiny apps where you might want to load different datasets or even environment files depending on one or more of the input menu choices.2. RStudio shortcut keysThis is less an R hack and more about the RStudio IDE, but the shortcut keys available for common commands are super useful and can save a lot of typing time. My two favourite are Ctrl+Shift+M for the pipe operator %>% and Alt+- for the assignment operator<-. If you want to see a full set of these awesome shortcuts just type Atl+Shift+K in RStudio.3. The flexdashboard packageIf you want to get a quick Shiny dashboard up and running with a minimum of fuss, the flexdashboard package has everything you need. It provides simple HTML shortcuts that allow easy construction of sidebars and the organization of your display into rows and columns. It also has a super flexible title bar where you can organize your app into different pages and put in icons and links to Github code or an email address or whatever. As a package which operates within RMarkdown it also allows you to keep all your app in one Rmd file rather than needing to break it out into separate server and UI files like for example shinydashboard. I use flexdashboard whenever I need to create a simple prototype version of a dashboard before moving it on to more advanced design. I can often get dashboards up and running within an hour using flexdashboard.4. The req and validate functions in R ShinyR Shiny development can be frustrating, especially when you get generic error messages that don’t help you understand what is going wrong under the hood. As Shiny develops, more and more validation and testing functions are being added to help better diagnose and alert when specific errors occur. The req() function allows you to prevent an action from occurring unless a another variable is present in the environment, but does so silently and without displaying an error. So you can make the display of UI elements conditional on previous actions. For example, with reference to my example no 1 above:output$go_button <- shiny::renderUI({  # only display button if an animal input has been chosen    shiny::req(input$animal)  # display button  shiny::actionButton(""go"",                       paste(""Conduct"", input$animal, ""analysis!"")   )})validate() checks before rendering an output and enables you to return a tailored error message should a certain condition not be fulfilled, for example if the user uploaded the wrong file:# get csv input fileinFile <- input$file1data <- inFile$datapath# render table only if it is dogsshiny::renderTable({  # check that it is the dog file, not cats or rabbits  shiny::validate(    need(""Dog Name"" %in% colnames(data)),    ""Dog Name column not found - did you load the right file?""  )  data})For more on these function see my other article here.5. Keeping credentials hidden using .RenvironIf you are sharing code that requires login credentials to databases and the like, you can use the .Reviron file to avoid posting those credentials to Github or other spaces where they might be at risk. .Renviron is a file where you can store important environment variables, and is easily editable using the function edit_r_environ() inside the usethis package. As an example, you can set an alias for your remote database credentials in .Renviron, for example:  DSN = ""database_name"",  UID = ""User ID"",  PASS = ""Password""Then in your shared script, you can call these variables. For example:db <- DBI::dbConnect(  drv = odbc::odbc(),  dsn = Sys.getenv(""DSN""),  uid = Sys.getenv(""UID""),  pwd = Sys.getenv(""PASS""))6. Automate tidyverse styling with stylerIts been a tough day, you’ve had a lot on your plate. Your code isn’t as neat as you’d like and you don’t have time to line edit it. Fear not. The stylerpackage has numerous functions to allow automatic restyling of your code to match tidyverse style. It’s a simple as running styler::style_file() on your messy script and it will do a lot (though not all) of the work for you.7. Parameterizing R Markdown documentsSo you write a lovely R Markdown document where you’ve analyzed a whole bunch of facts about dogs. And then you get told — ‘nah, I’m more interested in cats’. Never fear. You can automate a similar report about cats in just one command if you parameterize your R markdown document.You can do this by defining parameters in the YAML header of your R Markdown document, and giving each parameter a value. For example:---title: ""Animal Analysis""author: ""Keith McNulty""date: ""21 March 2019""output:  html_document:    code_folding: ""hide""params:  animal_name:    value: Dog    choices:      - Dog      - Cat      - Rabbit  years_of_study:    input: slider    min: 2000    max: 2019    step: 1    round: 1    sep: ''    value: [2010, 2017]---Now you can write these variables into the R code in your document as params$animal_name and params$years_of_study. If you knit your document as normal, it will knit with the default values of these parameters as per the value variable. However, if you knit with parameters by selecting this option in RStudio’s Knit dropdown (or by using knit_with_parameters()), a lovely menu option appears for you to select your parameters before you knit the document. Awesome!Knitting with Parameters8. revealjsrevealjs is a package which allows you to create beautiful presentations in HTML with an intuitive slide navigation menu, with embedded R code. It can be used inside R Markdown and has very intuitive HTML shortcuts to allow you to create a nested, logical structure of pretty slides with a variety of styling options. The fact that the presentation is in HTML means that people can follow along on their tablets or phones as they listen to you speak, which is really handy. You can set up a revealjspresentation by installing the package and then calling it in your YAML header. Here’s an example YAML header of a talk I gave recently using revealjs---title: ""Exporing the Edge of the People Analytics Universe""author: ""Keith McNulty""output:  revealjs::revealjs_presentation:    center: yes    template: starwars.html    theme: blackdate: ""HR Analytics Meetup London - 18 March, 2019""resource_files:- darth.png- deathstar.png- hanchewy.png- millenium.png- r2d2-threepio.png- starwars.html- starwars.png- stormtrooper.png---and here’s an example page. You can find the code here and the presentation here.Easy online presentations using revealjs9. HTML tags in R Shiny (eg play audio in your Shiny app)Most people don’t take full advantage of the HTML tags available in R Shiny. There are 110 tags which offer shortcuts to various HTML formatting and other commands. Recently I built a shiny app that took a long time to perform a task. Knowing that the user would likely multitask while waiting for it to complete, I used tags$audio to have the app play a victory fanfare to alert the user when the task was complete.10. The praise packageRidiculously simple but also awesome, the praise package delivers praise to users. While this can appear like pointless self-admiration, it’s actually super useful in writing R packages where you can offer praise or encouragement to someone if they do something right, for example if a process completes successfully. You can also just put it at the end of a complicated script to give you that extra shot of happiness when it runs successfully.The praise packageOriginally I was a Pure Mathematician, then I became a Psychometrician and a Data Scientist. I am passionate about applying the rigor of all those disciplines to complex people questions. I’m also a coding geek and a massive fan of Japanese RPGs.

My Beginnings with Angular.,https://medium.com/@caudlejohnp/my-beginnings-with-angular-da22d5b083e4?source=tag_archive---------47-----------------------,"Coding,Web Development,Austin Coding Academy,Lubbock Coding Academy","Discuss in words something you learned in class today or this week.One thing I learned in class is you can generate a new component for Angular in your powershell by using the command “ng generate component <insertName>” and it would auto populate the component in your text editor.What is string interpolation in Angular and what is the syntax for it?String Interpolation is a special syntax which is converted to property binding by Angular. It’s a convenient alternative to property binding. When you need to concatenate strings, you must use interpolation instead of property binding.Please explain the difference between Angular and AngularJS?First of all, Angular is based on TypeScript while AngularJS is based on JavaScript. TypeScript is a superset of ES6 and it’s backward compatible with ES5. AngularJS uses terms of scope and controller.Could you explain the concept of templates in Angular?A template is an HTML snippet that tells Angular how to render the component in angular application. The template is immediately associated with a component defines that component’s view.What are directives in Angular?Angular directives are used to extend the power of the HTML by giving by giving it new syntax. Each directive has a name — either one from the Angular predefined like ng-repeat, or a custom one which can be called anything. And each directive determines where it can be used: in an element, attribute, class or comment.Written byJohn CaudleFollowCodingWeb DevelopmentAustin Coding AcademyLubbock Coding AcademyMore from John CaudleFollowMore From MediumPlaying with JavaScript objectsHarsh Patel in JavaScript In Plain EnglishHow to make your website clean and maintainable with GraphQLOndřej Polesný in freeCodeCamp.orgHow to Use useDrag With ReactMikael Ainalem in Better ProgrammingThese are the features in ES6 that you should knowCristian Salcescu in Frontend Essentials2 Simple Tips to Increase Your Team Code QualityCalvin Nguyen in DataSeriesFundamentals of JavaScript ModulesSathishravi in JavaScript In Plain EnglishHow to make an app drawer with React Hooks and CSSAlbert ChuUnderstanding Promises in JavaScriptGokul N K in Better ProgrammingAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

Lodash is a JavaScript library which provides utility functions for common programming tasks using the functional programming paradigm.Explain Function.prototype.bind() Bind creates a new function that will force the this inside the function to be the parameter passed to bind().Describe event bubbling. It relates to the order in which event handlers are called when one element is nested inside a second element, and both elements have registered a listener for the same event (a click, for example).What’s the difference between window load event and document DOMContentLoaded event? The DOMContentLoaded event fires when the document is loaded and the DOM tree is fully constructed. The load event fires when all subframes, images, stylesheets, scripts, etc have been downloaded.Describe the call-stack. The call stack maintains a record of the position of each stack frame. It knows the next function to be executed (and will remove it after execution). This is what makes code execution in JavaScript synchronous. Since the call stack is organized as a stack, the caller pushes the return address onto the stack, and the called subroutine, when it finishes, pulls or pops the return address off the call stack and transfers control to that address.Written byJayswilderA student at Austin Coding Academy.FollowAustin Coding AcademyLubbock Coding AcademyWeb DevelopmentCodingMore from JayswilderFollowA student at Austin Coding Academy.More From MediumBest Practices for Writing Vue AppsJohn Au-Yeung in The StartupBoost productivity generating Angular Forms using SchematicsAdrian Lemes CaetanoJavaScript for Data EngineersKovid Rathee in JavaScript In Plain EnglishUse React Components and webpack With JekyllMarcos Lombog in Better ProgrammingCreating a precise countdown with Vanilla JSJuan Dalmasso in Weekly WebtipsVector Graphics for the WebRenegade Knight in JavaScript In Plain EnglishComparing Objects in JavaScriptgravity well (Rob Tomlin) in JavaScript In Plain EnglishUser Authentication Using MERN Stack — Part 1 (Backend)Anand Shrestha in The StartupAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
N/A,https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/prepare-your-webpage-for-chromes-upcoming-fast-page-label-f89e95ed7c77?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Software Development,Web Development,Performance,Optimization,Programming","Photo by Pierre Bamin on UnsplashRecently the developers from Chrome posted an article about introducing a brand new label for high performance websites, which aims to help users find the pages which offer a “high quality user experience on the web”:“To help users identify great experiences as they browse, we are excited to announce that Chrome will begin to highlight high quality user experiences on the web, starting with the labelling of fast links…” — Chromium blogChrome will start rolling out this feature in v85 for Android, however, it should be expected to reach desktop browsers soon enough.Long pressing on an URL would bring up this information (picture taken from the Chromium blog)What does this mean for us — the developers?The labelling of fast pages will naturally bring a sensible consequence: if people have a choice, they will choose to visit a super-duper fast page instead of a not-so-fast one.This might, in the long run, impact the number of page visits if we don’t proactively adapt to the “fast page” labelling.Thus, making our app load faster is more important than ever! We all might be required to learn more about the metrics which will be taken into consideration when categorizing webpages.The Core Web VitalsChrome will put (or not) the “Fast page” label on a website if it performs well in terms of the Core Web Vitals.Currently, the Core Web Vitals consists of three important metrics:Largest contentful paintFirst input delayCumulative layout shiftThese might sound familiar, as web developers have been looking and measuring similar metrics up until now as well (with the help of Lighthouse, for example).However, with Google starting to put websites in different buckets/categories based on these metrics, they are becoming really important for everyone to grasp.Largest contentful paint (LCP)This metric measures the perceived load speed of the webpage and marks the point when the page’s main content has likely loaded.The good, the bad-ish and the really bad (image courtesy of web.dev)As you can see above, a maximum of 2.5 seconds until the LCP is good, and anything more than that is considered bad.A few ideas for improving LCP:Use server-side renderingMake the JavaScript bundle size smaller (by removing unneeded dependencies, using code splitting, minifying code etc.)Optimize your assets: images, fonts, CSSUse a CDNMake sure you’re not blocking the render with JavascriptRead more on Largest Contentful Paint and Google’s recommendations here.First input delay (FID)“FID measures the time from when a user first interacts with a page (i.e. when they click a link, tap on a button, or use a custom, JavaScript-powered control) to the time when the browser is actually able to begin processing event handlers in response to that interaction.” — web.devRegarding this interesting metric, it is important to note that it is not actually looking at the time it takes to handle the events (i.e. the logic behind the event handling) but the time it takes for that event to start to be handled.As the browser uses a single JavaScript thread (the main thread) to make changes to the DOM, parse and handle network requests and handle events, there can be a delay until the user’s input starts to get handled (i.e. when the main thread is blocked).Ouch! This is, of course, not desirable and it is exactly what FID measures.The good, the bad-ish and the really bad (image courtesy of web.dev)Improving the FID can be mainly done by reducing JavaScript execution time on the main thread.Using a web worker (to run JavaScript on a different thread) and breaking up long running tasks are just 2 of the potential ideas that could improve this metric. Google, once again, has some great recommendations.Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)Let’s be honest. No one loves when elements are jumping around the screen. The Cumulative Layout Shift metric measures just this.Layout shifts mostly happen because of asynchronous loading of resources.Let’s say you’ve got 2 paragraphs of text and a picture in-between. Now, if that picture loads after the paragraphs have loaded, then the second paragraph will jump down to make space for the image. This doesn’t look good from the user’s perspective.The good, the bad-ish and the really bad (image courtesy of web.dev)How Google calculates CLS is described really well here.When trying to maintain a CLS really close to 0 (which is good), you should pay attention to the following:Always give fixed dimensions to images, videos, or generally any block of content (thus even if the content from within hasn’t yet loaded, the size stays the same)There are libraries out there which help you mimic the actual content and occupy the space (think of Youtube/Facebook’s placeholders — they occupy the size but show a loading indicator based on the actual content’s shape. Neat!)In closingLoading times and general web performance has always been important, but unfortunately it got oftentimes ignored.Google is apparently trying to encourage website owners to improve the loading time and general performance of their apps by labelling them by speed.Historically speaking, Google has done this before. Just think of websites served from HTTP and not HTTPS. We would get a lot warning if we tried to access such unsecure domains.It’s high time we started improving the metrics above.

Becoming a Full-Stack Developer from Scratch,https://medium.com/@theSDEshow/becoming-a-full-stack-developer-from-scratch-in-2020-9718dd4a2616?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Software Development,Web Development,Careers,Computer Science,Cloud Computing","Are you looking for a roadmap that will teach you software development step by step from scratch?Do you want to begin your career as a software developer but feel that there are lots of frameworks, libraries, runtime environments (are there ?) out there and you don’t know where to start and how to navigate?Are you confused by what I meant by runtime environments in the last question?Are you not sure if you should start with Web Development or Android App development?Did you do HTML, CSS, JavaScript quickly at first but now are confused about what to do next?Full Stack Development is the most popular developer occupation today. No wonder the Internet is so full of courses and tutorials that teach you Front-end, Back-end, Databases, Cloud Services, Deployments, Architecture, System Design, etc and then even assist these new developers land high-paying programming jobs. The problem is that it becomes overwhelming for a beginner to find his way through them in a structured way.In this article, I’ll create a step by step ladder of 8 steps that a person can follow to become a successful Full-stack Web Developer. I’ll assume you don’t have any prior experience in software development but do have basic knowledge of coding. If not, check my blog on “Building a career in software Development without a computer science degree” to get started.First a bit of motivation:The demand for software developers in the world is very high and with more and more new startups, the demand will certainly increase.The starting salaries of software developers in India are typically twice the salary of other streams. If you are from a tier 1 college, expect even more.Some famous person has said — the best investment you can do to yourself in today’s era is to teach yourself how to program.The Software Development LadderFull stack Developer is someone who can look after three aspects of development: Front-End, Back-End and DevOps. Front-end refers to logic which is visible to the client. It includes the User Interface facing the clients. Consider www.amazon.com for an example. What you see when you visit the site is the front-end. Back-end refers to logic running on server side. When you try to visit www.amazon.com, you send a request to the servers of www.amazon.com, requesting it to show you the home page of Amazon. How the servers process that request is handled by Back-End logic. It involves fetching data from a Database and then sending it back to front-end so the visitor can see the page. The DevOps takes care of hosting and deployment of a web service. In order to keep your web service or website live at all times, there should be a server running at all times to keep listening to requests coming from all over the world. DevOps takes care of servers, load balancing, CI/CD (continuous Integration/continuous Deployment), and architecture of your web service. Don’t worry if the above terms scare you. You’ll know what they are by the end of this blog.Step 1: HTML/CSS/BootstrapHTML (Hyper Text Markup Protocol) and CSS (Cascading Style sheets ) are the building blocks of the web. HTML defines the basic structure of a web page. HTML is not a programming language, it is just a markup language which your browser can understand and place various elements of a web page where they are required. HTML allows you to add content to a webite. CSS helps you make your web pages more fashionable. It lets you style your pages to make it look stylish and colorful.Head over to this free course by codecademy for HTML if you want to learn HTML quickly within a couple of days. If you want to understand HTML and all its intricacies, MDN has complete documentation which will teach you HTML from scratch to Advanced level. After this, learn CSS from Codecademy, W3Schools or MDN. The order is increasing on the basis of amount of depth the course will teach you about CSS. Choose as per your needs.Bootstrap is a tool which will help you in making responsive sites. Responsive means that the website would scale as per the device on which a website is viewed on. W3Schools should be enough for learning it. The different elements in your website should know where to go when you start decreasing the size of your browser window. For example, see how this blog page scales as you start decreasing the size of the window in which it is open. If you do not wish to use Bootstrap, you can still make your site responsive using media queries in CSS.Step 2: JavaScriptJavaScript provides your website with extraordinary powers. It makes your cotntent more dynamic. You ever click the like button on a facebook post and it changes the total number of likes on a post? That’s Javascript. The JavaScript language is growing more popular every year and new libraries, frameworks, and tools are constantly being released. There are basically two phases in which you need to learn JavaScript. First, where it runs in the browser and let’s you do magic stuff on front-end like changing the text of a paragraph on clicking it or increasing the like counter of a facebook post.The second phase is more complex where it runs outside the environment of a web browser and runs on server-side. The upside of learning JavaScript is that it is the only language that can run both on front-end and back-end(as you’ll see below with Node.js). You can start learning Js from W3Schools.Learn the syntax. How variables are defined, loops, scope of variables, Objects. Understand how to work with the DOM. Also know what JSON is and how to manipulate it .After getting basic knowledge from w3schools, head over to MDN for getting in-depth knowledge of JS and it’s working. Learn the Document Object Model in order to play around with your website. Make sure you understand Asynchronous Programming in Javascript. Learn how blocking code is a problem. Learn how promises and callbacks work. Read about async and await. Spend time here as it will form your basics for learning Back-end later.Step 3: Back-End LanguagesWhat we learnt uptil now is used on client or front-end. You may think that you don’t need a back-end as you can make all the web pages you want using HTML , CSS and Js only. But things get pretty complex pretty quick once the scale of your website grows. You can’t just have a website with 1000000 HTML pages. What if you wanted to make a UI change? Would you make those changes in all 1000000 pages? Back-end is responsible for handling user-authentication (Login/Sign-up), providing templates and resources on the basis of URLs that you send (by fetching data from database if needed).There are a number of choices you have for learning back-end language. Each language has it’s own framework for back-end. A framework is a tool which helps you by providing a basic template for your back-end so you don’t have to re-write code which is commonly used in all back-end services like creation of server, routing requests as per url etc.The major choices available are :JavaScript — Node.js — Express (Framework)Python — Django, FlaskJava — SpringRuby — Ruby on Rails, SinatraPHPI’d suggest you go with JS-Node combo because you already learnt JS and it can be used on both front end and back-end. Node.js is a very powerful JavaScript-based platform built on Google Chrome’s JavaScript V8 Engine. Js has some really cool front end frameworks which we will come to learn about later in the blog. Python, on the other hand just has django and flask and no support for front-end. Java is not that popular these days but all big MNCs use it. PHP is outdated. No body uses it anymore. If your boss forces you to use Java or PHP, find a new job.If you go with Javascript, make sure you head over to MDN and learn Asynchronous Programming in Javascript. Blocking code causes troubles on back-end and may block your service if the code is synchronous. Make sure you understand the concepts of Promises and Callbacks. For learning Node.js head over to this link. The link will teach you everything you need to know about node. You’ll learn how to create servers, request-response cycle, etc. Make sure you also learn how node package manager (NPM) works. It’s a cool thing.Step 4: Back-End FrameworkThere are two architectures or designs on which back end is designed. MVC and MVT. MVC is Model-View-Controller approach and MVT is Model-View-Template approach. Express, which is a framework for Node.js is MVC based and Django is MVT based. Know the difference beween the two. Back-end is used in order to fetch data from database , populate that data in templates and then send those templates to front-end. The URL that comes as a part of request from front end tells the back end framework which data to fetch and which template to use. All of this would be explained in routing, database connection and server connection when you start learning a framework.If you chose JS for back-end language and learnt Node, head over to this link to learn Express. The link will also teach you how to practically apply the knowledge of Node that you learnt earlier.If you are comfortable with Python and picked up Python earlier, head over to this link to learn django. The link will teach you to build a simple Django application in a 7 step process. You can also learn from Django Girls Tutorial. Don’t fall for name, nothing sexist here. This is one of the best Django tutorials out there. Spend a week’s time understanding it. Spend time in understanding how Django works — model, view, template architecture. You can also choose Flask in place of Django. This tutorial should serve as a good starting point to get your hands dirty with flask.Step 5: DatabasesDatabase act as data storage for your web service. they can be used to store data for your website like blog articles, list of people with their contact information, etc. There are two types of databases. Relational Databases and Non-relational Databases. Relational database, as the name suggests, stores data in the form of tables. Non-relational database store data in a form which is not tabular in nature. SQL is Structured query Language and is used in order to fetch data from relational (tabular) databases.You need to learn SQL first. Head over to this link. SQL databases are the ones on which we can use SQL to fetch data. NoSQL are the ones which do not store data in tabular forms and hence SQL can’t be used. You need to learn one SQL based and one NoSQL based Database. Understand which would be better in certain situations. MongoDB is a popular choice for NoSQL and PostgreSQL is a common choice for SQL database.MongoDB also has a framework, Mongoose which fits perfectly with Express. While you are at it, understand the benefits of in-memory data stores like Redis or memcached. You can also study Web storage to store sessions, cookies, and cached data in the browser (Optional).Step 5: Front-End FrameworksIn order to make your life easier, there are front-end frameworks which help you just like the back-end frameworks. Frameworks were created so that developers would not have to re write code which is repeatedly written every time you start a new project. Frameworks exist so you don’t re-create the wheel.Two popularly used front-end frameworks Angular and React. Angular was released in 2016 by Google and React was released in 2013 by Facebook. Both are open source and highly in demand.React introduced the concept of JSX which is JavaScript XML. Traditionally, Js code is being injected into HTML but with JSX, we started looking at the problem with a whole new perspective and HTML code started being injected in HTML.Relative Popularity Scores of Front-End Frameworks.Learning React and Angular would open the positions of MEAN and MERN developer for you. MERN refers to MongoDB(Database), Express(Back end framework), React(Front-End Framework) and Node.js(Runtime environment). You can head over to this page if you want to learn React by doing a project or this link if you like to start studying about a technology first and then later you can try making projects. Anyway, you must check out this overview of React by Tania Rascia. It briefly makes you understand the inticacies of React very easily. For Angular, you can learn the basics of syntax here. but you’ll have to understand it in-depth from here.Step 6: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol + Representational State TransferHTTP or Hyper Text Trnsfer protocol is a stateless application protocol on the Internet — it’s what allows clients to communicate with servers (e.g. your JavaScript code can make an AJAX request to some back-end code you have running on a server which will happen via HTTP). Learn the following in order:What is REST and why is it important in regards to the HTTP protocol and web applications?Best practices for designing a RESTful API. POST/GET requests.Learning how to use Chrome DevTools can be extremely helpful.What are SSL Certificates.WebSockets, Web Workers, and Service Workers (all optional).Step 7: Git for Version Control SystemOnce, you have built the front-end and back-end for your website or web service, you need to store it somewhere inorder to exhibit it to the world or manage the versioning. As a project grows larger and larger and more people start contributing to it, it becomes difficult to keep track of all files that a contributor changes. In order to solve this problem, we need a version control system.Git is the most popular VCS out there. It is open source and it combines really well with Github. Github is a website where you can upload your code as different project repositories. The changes you make to the project are stored in order and you can rollback to any previous versions any time you want.Version control is a system where you save files so you can look back over time and see what you changed at what point. It’ll probably be used at every software company you ever work at, and knowing the basics is really important.Make an account on Github. Next, head over to this link. This will teach you how to start a git project, commit changes, maintain versions, concept of branches, pull and push code, etc.Here’s a collection of commonly used git commands : Git CommandsHere’s a tutorial on using Git and GitHub for beginners.Step 8: Hosting and Deploying CodeUntil the revolution of Cloud computing happened, thanks to AWS( Amazon Web Services) by amazon, GCP (Google Cloud Platform) by Google and Microsft Azure, people used to manage their own servers for making their web services go live. Any Computer can be used to create a server.For example, SimpleHTTPServer in Python starts a local server on your computer and when you visit localhost:8080 through your browser, you can see home page of your python application. similar server can be spin up using Node/Express too. Now, when you run these commands, the server is available on your own network only and is not visible to the Internet. In order to make it visible to th Internet, you can use a service called Ngrok which can create a tunnel for the internet to connect to your localhost.But, your personal computer cannot stay online 24*7 and it won’t be able to handle all the requests if the traffic on your website rises exponentially. With the introduction of Cloud Services, we pay third party companies to share their servers for us to host or deploy our code. Heroku, Firebase, AWS, GCP are few such loud service providers. Using webhooks, you can trigger new builds on AWS from your Github Repository itself. Moreover, AWS provides a shared security model. When top class engineers from all over the world are working to make your data secure, you can trust on it :)AWS provides not only computing power(E2 instances) but also storage services(S3 buckets) and machine learning resources (Textract and comprehend). You can have a look at the complete documentation of cloud services available from AWS here. Cloud computing is a whole new topic in itself and cannot be explained in this blog itself.Once you have deployed your code, you have completed all the three phases of full stack developer. Now, you’ll be able to manage the front-end, back-end and devops part of your web service on your own.It’ll be hard work learning all of this, but it’s rewarding in the end and Full-Stack Development is fun!With this, we come to the end of this blog. I believe I have covered almost all aspects of Full stack Development. If this post is received well, in upcoming articles I’ll be writing about Android Development, Open Source Development and my journey to crack Google Summer of Code and Amazon.I’ll also be writing more about “How to get into GSoC Program without any Open source contribution experience and my Amazon story” and “How to prepare for FAANG interviews”.

ReactDOM.RenderToString을 사용하여 Document 생성 및 서빙하고, 이후 브라우저단에서 hydrate, 일부 지연되어도 되는 데이터 요청 및 처리합니다.2. 성능 문제 발생지난 5월 말 스마트 주문 페이지가 느리다는 제보를 받고 얼마나 느린지 측정해봤습니다. 여러 번 측정한 뒤 평균이 되는 데이터를 캡쳐했습니다.측정에 사용한 도구는 Chrome > 개발자도구 > Performance입니다.Stage 환경측정 결과 다음과 같은 문제가 있음을 확인할 수 있었습니다.문서 응답 시간Document를 응답받는 시간입니다. 평균적으로 3초 중반을 형성했습니다.초기 스크립트 처리 완료 시점초기 스크립트 처리가 완료되어야 유저의 액션에 대한 응답을 할 수 있기 때문에 중요한 지표입니다. (TTI: Time To Interaction) 측정 결과 5.2초에 완료되었고, 문서 응답 시간을 제외하면 문서 응답 후 1.7초 뒤 스레드가 유저 액션을 처리할 수 있었습니다.스펙 추가다음 두가지 스펙이 성능 개선 도중에 추가되었습니다.개인화 (헤더에 최근 주문 이력, 최근 주문 메뉴, 프로모션 데이터 노출)ScrollSpy UI 추가 (다수의 메뉴를 한 화면에 모두 그림)3. 문제 원인 파악측정된 성능을 바탕으로 어떤 문제가 있는지 확인해봤습니다.SSR시점 과다, 중복 호출스마트 주문은 각 카테고리별로 메뉴 API를 호출합니다. (인기 메뉴, 커피, 디저트, 상품 등..) 스와이프 동작을 통해 다음 카테고리를 확인할 수 있는 UI 임에도 화면에 보이지 않는 카테고리까지 호출하는 것을 확인할 수 있었습니다인기 메뉴 카테고리만 우선적으로 필요합니다.만약 해당 페이지에 카테고리가 6개 있다고 하면, 6개 카테고리에 해당하는 메뉴 전부 SSR 시점에 불러오고 있었습니다.GET /options?scheduleId=1000&categoryId=1000 (214ms)GET /options?scheduleId=1001&categoryId=1001 (239ms)GET /options?scheduleId=1002&categoryId=1002 (164ms)GET /options?scheduleId=1003&categoryId=1003 (165ms)GET /options?scheduleId=1004&categoryId=1004 (131ms)GET /options?scheduleId=1005&categoryId=1005 (227ms)또한 이 모든 메뉴 API들이 직렬로 호출되고 있었습니다. 즉 이전 메뉴 요청에 대한 응답이 없으면 다음 메뉴를 요청하지 않습니다.이 외에 사용하지 않는 데이터를 호출하거나, 같은 데이터를 3번 중복 호출하는 문제를 찾을 수 있었습니다.# /user 3번 호출, /business 3번 호출, /codes 사용하지 않지만 호출GET /codes (51ms)GET /user (159ms)GET /user (175ms)GET /waiting-status (50ms)GET /businesses/300000?lang=ko (57ms)GET /businesses/300000?lang=ko&projections=foo (69ms)GET /user (151ms)GET /businesses/300000?lang=ko&projections=foo,bar (70ms)GET /businesses/300000/agencies (33ms)직렬 호출많은 API 호출이 SSR 시점에 직렬로 호출되고 있었습니다. 즉 각 호출마다 블로킹이 걸려 이전 응답이 와야 요청할 수 있었습니다.붉은색 호출만 병렬로 호출되는 부분입니다.느린 API 응답하기 두 API가 Elastic Search 조회 및 데이터 검증 작업을 수행하면서 느린 응답 속도를 기록했습니다./api/옵션 카테고리DB에서 데이터를 확인한 뒤 인기메뉴로 노출할 수 있는 메뉴가 있는지 검증, 데이터를 응답/api/메뉴주문수, 별점 정보를 얻어오기 위해 Elastic Search 추가 조회스크립트 처리 시간보이지 않는 영역의 데이터까지 미리 받아오고 렌더링 했기 때문에 스크립트 처리 시간이 길었습니다. 또한 단일 메뉴 컴포넌트당 처리하는 로직들이 무거웠습니다.4. 문제 해결사용자가 처음 보는 화면에 필요한 데이터만 호출SSR 시점 과다, 중복 호출 문제를 해결하기 위해 유저가 처음 보는 화면의 데이터만 SSR 시점에 받아오고 렌더링 하도록 처리했습니다.# AS-ISGET /options?scheduleId=1000&categoryId=1000 (214ms)GET /options?scheduleId=1001&categoryId=1001 (239ms)GET /options?scheduleId=1002&categoryId=1002 (164ms)GET /options?scheduleId=1003&categoryId=1003 (165ms)GET /options?scheduleId=1004&categoryId=1004 (131ms)GET /options?scheduleId=1005&categoryId=1005 (227ms)# TO-BEGET /options?scheduleId=1000&categoryId=1000 (127ms)서로 의존이 없는 데이터는 병렬 호출API간 의존이 없는 경우는 병렬로 호출하도록 처리했습니다. 상위 개선되지 않은 호출들 제외하고 호출 단위가 11개에서 5개로 개선되었습니다.3개, 6개의 API를 병렬로 한꺼번에 요청중복호출 제거반복되는 API 호출을 제거했습니다. SSR 시점에 아래 두가지 이유로 몇몇 API를 중복 호출하고 있었습니다.스마트 주문에서는 GraphQL을 사용하고 있으며 GraphQL 쿼리를 나타냅니다.같은 쿼리지만 필드가 다르거나 추가되는 경우 요청같은 쿼리이고 필드도 같지만 데이터 응답을 받기 전따라서 쿼리를 단일 Document로 작성해둔 뒤 동일 참조의 쿼리를 재사용하도록 하여 중복요청을 보내지 않도록 처리했습니다.// 동일한 참조의 쿼리를 재사용하여 중복요청 제거export const UserDocument = gql` query user { id name nickname email phone isAdult bookingCount isMembershipUser // … }`이처럼 쿼리 재사용, 불필요한 쿼리 제거를 통해 다음과 같이 API 호출량을 줄였습니다.# AS-ISGET /codes (51ms)GET /user (159ms)GET /user (175ms)GET /waiting-status (50ms)GET /businesses/300000?lang=ko (57ms)GET /businesses/300000?lang=ko&projections=foo (69ms)GET /user (151ms)GET /businesses/300000?lang=ko&projections=foo,bar (70ms)GET /businesses/300000/agencies (33ms)# TO-BEGET /user (175ms)GET /waiting-status (50ms)GET /businesses/300000?lang=ko (57ms)GET /businesses/300000?lang=ko&projections=foo,bar (70ms)GET /businesses/300000/agencies (33ms)오래 걸리는 API는 지연호출 혹은 클라이언트에서 처리[느린 API 응답] 에서 언급한 느린 API에 대해 다음과 같이 처리했습니다.1. /api/옵션 카테고리AS-ISAPI 서버에서 인기 메뉴 카테고리가 존재하는지 검증 (DB조회)TO-BE어차피 전체 메뉴 정보를 받아오기 때문에 받아온 메뉴 정보들을 클라이언트에서 조합하여 존재 여부 검증2. /api/메뉴AS-ISSSR 시점에 특정 메뉴들의 주문수, 평점 ES 조회TO-BESSR시점에는 주문수, 평점 데이터를 조회하지 않고 메뉴만 조회. 클라이언트 측에서 주문수, 평점 정보 지연 요청* pros) 문서 응답 시간 단축, 피로도 감소* cons) 주문수, 별점 지연 노출로 UI 변경4.4. 스크립트 처리 시간 단축메뉴가 많을수록 연산이 증가하기 때문에 각 메뉴 컴포넌트에서 무거운 로직들을 제거했습니다.Intl.NumberFormat 의 인스턴스 캐싱단일 메뉴 컴포넌트에서는 가격을 각 국가의 포맷에 맞춰 표시하기 위해 렌더링마다 Intl.NumberFormat의 인스턴스를 생성했습니다. ScrollSpy UI 같이 메뉴를 많이 표시하는 UI의 경우 생성자 호출이 빈번해지기 때문에 생성한 인스턴스를 캐싱하여 사용하도록 했습니다.아래는 인스턴스를 매 렌더링마다 생성했을 경우와 캐싱 해두고 사용하는 것을 비교한 테스트 코드입니다.// 함수에서 생성자를 통해 인스턴스 생성function useConstructor(price) { const formatter = new Intl.NumberFormat(‘ko’) return formatter.format(price)}// 상위 스코프에 캐싱해두고 사용const fomatter = new Intl.NumberFormat(‘ko’)function useCaching(price) { return fomatter.format(price)}// 테스트 함수function test(cb, time) { console.time(cb.name) for (let i = 0; i < time; i++) { cb(10000) } console.timeEnd(cb.name)}// 테스트 실행 (Chrome)// 메뉴 100개, 초기 렌더링 21 => 총 2100회test(useConstructor, 2100) // useConstructor: 60.779052734375 mstest(useCaching, 2100) // useCaching: 0.986083984375msuseXXX 커스텀 훅을 상위 컴포넌트에서 실행React의 useXXX 커스텀 훅 내 로직들 모두 렌더링마다 호출되기 때문에 최대한 상위에서 받아올 수 있도록 수정했습니다.ex) useRouter, useI18n, useLanguage, useOrder사용자가 보는 부분만 렌더링[사용자가 처음 보는 화면에 필요한 데이터만 호출] 처리로 사용자가 보는 부분만 데이터를 가지게 되면서 렌더링도 사용자가 보는 부분만 렌더링 됩니다.상위 컴포넌트 렌더링 최소화React에서는 상위 컴포넌트가 렌더링 되는 경우 별다른 처리가 없다면 하위 컴포넌트가 같이 렌더링 되기 때문에 불필요한 렌더링을 막기 위해 상위 컴포넌트의 불필요한 리렌더링 로직을 제거했습니다.추가로 React는 성능 최적화를 위해 React.memo라는 함수를 제공합니다. 실제로 테스트 효과는 있었지만 의존성 관리로 인해 디버깅 및 관리가 까다로울 것으로 생각되었고, 이 함수를 적용할 만큼 성능이 안좋지 않아서 사용하지 않았습니다. 정말 스크립트 처리 성능이 나오지 않을 때 고려해보시면 좋을 것 같습니다.5. 개선 후 성능 측정 결과 비교다음과 같은 개선 결과를 얻을 수 있었습니다.문서 응답 시간 2.2초 개선문서가 응답된 시점부터 초기 스크립트 처리가 완료되는 시점까지 0.8초 개선전체적으로 3.2초 개선해당 스크린샷은 Production 환경입니다.6. 사용한 성능 측정 도구 및 측정 방법 공유6.1. 성능 측정 도구성능 측정에 다음 도구들을 사용했습니다. 많은 분들이 사용해 보셨을 거라 생각합니다. :)Chrome canary개발자용 나이틀리 빌드입니다. 저는 Lighthouse 최신버전이 Chrome canary 에서 사용 가능하여 사용했습니다.여러 최신 기능을 사용할 수 있기 때문에 사용을 고려해봐도 좋을 것 같습니다. :)#Chrome canaryChrome Performance개발자 도구 > Performance 입니다. 스크립트 처리의 병목구간을 확인하는데 주로 사용했습니다.개인적으로 참고했던 지표는 다음과 같습니다.무거운 연산 표시해당 그래프는 브라우저가 어떤 연산 작업을 했는지를 나타냅니다. 제가 표시해놓은 빨간 표시는 50ms 이상 작업을 하는 경우 표시됩니다.크롬에서는 유저의 동작에 대해 100ms 내로 페인팅이 되는 것을 권장합니다. #web.dev2.

PHP 7.x — P42: Callback Functions,https://medium.com/dev-genius/php-7-x-p42-callback-functions-6552477f2a87?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"PHP,Programming,Web Development,Software Development,Computer Science","It’s time for callback functions. What is a callback function? It’s just a function that’s passed as an argument to another function and is then executed inside the other function. I think it’s time to go through this concept in excruciating detail to put this behind us once and for all. We’ll cover passing anonymous functions (closures) and arrow functions as arguments to other functions, and then calling them too.Callback functions make a lot of sense in asynchronous languages since we may not want two functions to compete for finishing times. One function might be dependent on the result of another function, so we would need the two functions to execute synchronously (one after the other).We’re used to passing integers, strings, and even arrays as arguments into functions, but we might not be familiar with passing functions themselves as arguments into other functions.If you’re not familiar with the concept of how functions work, I suggest that you read my other articles on the concepts. Here are a few that you might want to familiarize yourself with before proceeding.PHP 7.x — P35: User Defined FunctionsPHP 7.x — P36: Function ArgumentsPHP 7.x — P37: Functions Returning ValuesPHP 7.x — P38: Variable FunctionsPHP 7.x — P39: Anonymous FunctionsPHP 7.x — P40: use KeywordPHP 7.x — P41: Arrow FunctionsI will recap a few concepts briefly just so that the overall picture makes more sense. We’ll create a function add_one_to_x() that accepts one argument. The function will then add 1 to the argument and echo out the result.Pretty standard so far. We passed an integer as an argument. The way that you can think about it is that the value 5 was assigned to the variable (parameter) $x. Just imagine that we moved $x into the function body. The result would be the same.Of course this doesn’t give us the flexibility to pass an argument to the function since it’s hard-coded inside of the function body, but it’s important to have this visual. We can also visualize this by assigning a default value to the parameter.The whole purpose of these basic examples is to have a visual of the movement of the argument from the function call to the function definition. Let’s see what happens when we pass the argument to the add_one_to_x() function.I am sure that you already knew this. I think we spent enough time on this concept so let’s move on to the next concept.Did you know that there is another way to call functions in PHP?You’ve probably called functions like I did on line 7 above. But, PHP has a built in function, call_user_func(), that accepts a string as an argument. That string is the name of the function that you want to call. The call_user_func(“say_hello”) statement on line 8 does the exact same thing as say_hello() on line 7. There’s no trickery here: it literally is just another way to call a function.Let’s create a function called animal_says(). Initially, that function will accept two arguments. Those arguments will just be echoed out once the function is called.In the example above, the two arguments are passed to the animal_says() function. That function will then echo out Cat says Dogs suck. I created two echo statements since we’ll be modifying this function next.Let’s change the second echo statement. Instead of directly echoing out the argument $animal_saying, we’ll call another function that will do that for us.We start by creating a new function, cat_says(). That function accepts one argument and it echoes out the value when it’s called. The cat_says() function is called from within the animal_says() function. Those were the changes. Let’s walk through this example and see what’s happening. We still haven’t gotten to the concept of callback functions just yet, but we’re really close.PHP reaches line 12. The function animal_says() is called and two arguments are passed: the strings Cat and Dogs suck.PHP enters the function animal_says() on line 3. The first argument is concatenated to the string “ says “ and is echoed out.The second argument, Dogs suck, is passed as an argument to the cat_says() function.PHP enters the cat_says() function. The argument Dogs suck is echoed out.PHP exits the cat_says() function and returns to the animal_says() function.PHP exits the animal_says() function and finishes the execution of the program after line 12.The total output is: Cat says Dogs suck.If I know cats, and I do, they will always say that Dogs suck. So what’s the point in passing the argument in the first place to the cat_says() function. We can just echo it right there.The dogs were offended. They want to have their own function as well. Let’s create a dog_says() function. They want to always say that Cats suck.Let’s imagine that we don’t have access to the cat_says() and dog_says() functions directly and that we only have access to the animal_says() function (you’ll see this concept in object oriented programming, which we’ll cover later articles).If we call the animal_says() function and pass it the Cat argument, we will get the following output: Cat says Dogs suck. If we call the animal_says() function and pass it the Dog argument, we will get the following output: Dog says Dogs suck. That’s not what we want however; we want it to say Dog says Cats suck. Currently, the cat_says() function is hard-coded on line 5. We could do an if/else statement and call the cat_says() function if the Cat argument is passed, and call the dog_says() function if the Dog argument is passed.This does work, but what if we wanted to add a function for every animal? Each type of animal wants to say something unique, and inconsistent, so we’ll have to create functions for each animal. That means that we’ll have a massive if/else statement.Let’s eliminate that headache now. Wouldn’t it be nice to just pass which function we want and have it called automatically without the if/else statement? Remember the call_user_func() function? If we pass the name of the function to it, we can call the specific function.Our animal_says() function will need to accept a second argument. That second argument will be the name of the function that we want to call. We’ll then pass that string argument to the call_user_func() function and have PHP call the function.Let’s walk through the example and make sure that we get the results that we want.The animal_says() function is called on line 16 and is passed two arguments: the string Cat and the string cat_says.PHP enters the function animal_says on line 3. It enters the body of the function and executes the echo statement on line 4: Cat says.It then moves to the next line (5) and passes the $animal_function argument to the call_user_func() function. The string “cat_says” is passed to the call_user_func(). The call_user_func() function itself calls the cat_says() function, which in turn echoes out Dogs suck.PHP exits the cat_says() function and returns to the animal_says() function.PHP exits the animal_says() function and returns to line 16. The statement on line 16 is over and PHP moves to line 17.PHP calls the animal_says() function and passes two arguments to it: the string Dog and the string dog_says.PHP enters the function animal_says on line 3. It enters the body of the function and executes the echo statement on line 4: Dog says.It then moves to the next line (5) and passes the string dog_says to the call_user_func(). The call_user_func() function itself calls the dog_says() function, which in turn echoes out Cats suck.PHP exits the dog_says() function and returns to the animal_says() function.PHP exits the animal_says() function and returns to line 17. The statement on line 17 is over and PHP finishes the program.That’s almost what a callback function is. The function name, which is a string, is passed as an argument, and is executed inside of the animal_says() function. And to be honest, you could stop here and execute functions this way. The only thing that you would need to know is how to pass arguments to the functions that are called with the call_user_func() function. Let’s just make sure that we have all of our bases covered and discuss that concept too.Our cats and dogs sat down and worked out some differences. It turns out that they want to be able to say different things and not just Dogs suck or Cats suck. The cat_says() and dog_says() functions will have to be modified so that they can accept an argument and echo that argument out. The call_user_func() has a second optional parameter, which allows the user to pass an argument to the function.call_user_func( $function_name, $function_arg = """" )Writing out call_user_func(“dog_says”, “Hello”) would be the same as calling the dog_says() function like this: dog_says(“Hello”). Let’s put those principles into practice.The animal_says() function now accepts three arguments:the string $animal_type that will be echoed out on line 4.the string $animal_function that will be passed to the call_user_func() function so that it can execute a function call.the string $saying that will also be passed to the call_user_func() function. This time, it will be passed as an argument to the function that the call_user_func() function is told to execute.So, looking at line 16, the animal_says() function is called and is passed the three arguments: strings Cat, cat_says, and I love dogs. Cat is echoed out on line 4 and the two other arguments are passed to the call_user_func() function on line 5. The call_user_func() executes the function call cat_say($saying) and passes the I love dogs argument to it. PHP executes the echo statement on line 9, Meow: I love dogs. The process is repeated on line 17 with new arguments that trigger the dog_says() function to be called.We don’t have to use the call_user_func() function for our function call. Remember variable functions? Variable functions can be beneficial when you want to call a function dynamically based on the value stored inside of the variable. As a quick recap, you can store the name of a function as a string inside of a variable, and call the function by appending a couple of parentheses to the variable.We can use this concept to replace our call_user_func() since the name of the function is stored inside of our $animal_function parameter. We’ll just replace call_user_func($animal_function, $saying) with $animal_function($saying); we’re just modifying line 5.I know that I’m incrementally making changes, and I’m doing this cautiously. I want to make sure that you understand each progression.Next, the only change that we’re going to do is change the parameter name from $animal_function to $callback. It’s customary to call this parameter $callback to make it explicitly clear that the function will be called inside of this function.Are we here? Is it possible that we’re finally going to tackle callback functions? Yes. So far, we’ve been passing the name (string) of the function that we want to call inside of the animal_says() function. But remember, a callback function is a function that’s passed as an argument, not a string that’s passed as an argument.Let’s change the functions cat_says() and dog_says() to anonymous functions. We’ll assign them to variables $cat_says and $dog_says. When we change the those, than we can pass the variable $cat_says and the variable $dog_says as arguments, instead of the strings cat_says and dog_says. Before we do that, let’s briefly recap anonymous functions and how to all them.In the example above, we create a variable $cat_says and assign the anonymous function (closure) to it. That closure has one parameter, $cat_saying, and echoes out Meow: followed by the parameter value (the value of $cat_saying). The closure is called on line 7 by appending the parentheses to the $cat_says() function and passing the argument I love dogs. Once the function is executed, the output will be Meow: I love dogs.We have one function tackled; now, let’s just modify the second function, dog_says(), and pass the two variables to the animal_says() function. We’re not going to need to modify anything internally since variable functions and anonymous functions technically have the same syntax.Looking at the code, we changed the cat_says() function to a closure on line 8. We also changed the dog_says() function to a closure on line 12. We’re then passing the $cat_says closure and $dog_says closure as arguments on line 16 and 17. This is what developers can’t seem to wrap their heads around, so I’m going to draw it out. Let’s look at line 16 and just focus on the second argument. If you need a refresher on passing strings as arguments, you can look at the first illustration at the beginning of this article.Since $cat_says is equal to the closure, we can just replace the argument as the closure. So just pretend that we shoved the entire function into the argument.As you can see, the closure is passed as an argument to the animal_says() function. The closure is assigned to the $callback parameter. We now know what the $callback variable holds; it just holds the closure. How do we call a closure? By appending parentheses to the variable name and passing any arguments to it. Let’s now expand this and see how the third argument travels.The argument is passed when the animal_says() function is called.It’s assigned as the third parameter value.It’s passed to the $callback() function call.It’s passed to the closure.It’s echoed out from inside of the closure.What would prevent us from just passing the entire closure as an argument instead of passing the variable that’s assigned to the closure? Well, nothing. We’re passing strings as arguments, why can’t we just pass functions as arguments? We could have assigned the string “I love dogs” to a variable and then passed the variable, but we didn’t. We just passed the string.Let’s look at passing anonymous functions as arguments. This time, we won’t be creating the $dog_says and $cat_says closures. We’re just going to pass those closures as arguments directly.We just got rid of the two closures and passed them directly as arguments.On line 8, a call to animal_says() function is made.The first argument is the string Cat. That string is assigned to the $animal_type parameter.The second argument is the function: function( $cat_saying ) { … };. That function is assigned to the parameter $callback.The third argument is the string I love dogs. That string is assigned to the parameter $saying.Going inside of the animal_says() function, the first argument is echoed out on line 4.On line 5, we’re just calling the closure that was assigned to the $callback parameter by appending a couple of parentheses to it and passing the $saying parameter value to it.As long as you can wrap your head around it visually and see how the closure is moving around the code, callback functions should be a breeze. I placed the anonymous function on the same line as the other two arguments, but for readability, the closure argument is usually spaced out onto multiple lines. This is just preference.We can also pass arrow functions instead of anonymous functions for even more simplicity. Remember that arrow functions can only return an argument. We’ll modify the code one last time.Looking at line 8, the arrow function is passed as the second argument. The arrow function will accept an argument once it’s called on line 5. That argument is I love dogs. It will return Meow: I love dogs. The entire string will be echoed out on line 5.And that’s it. I think we covered everything there is to know about callback functions. I really hope that this makes sense now and that you can put your fears of callback functions behind you once and for all.dinocajic/php-7-youtube-tutorialsCode for the PHP 7.x YouTube tutorials.github.comDev GeniusCoding, Tutorials, News, UX, UI and much more related to developmentFollow28 Sign up for Best StoriesBy Dev GeniusThe best stories sent monthly to your email. Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

It’s just used to make the page look good.Notice that we’ve attached scripts to each of our HTML pages…/* popup-sign-in-script.js */const button = document.querySelector('button');button.addEventListener('mouseover', () => {    button.style.backgroundColor = 'black';    button.style.color = 'white';    button.style.transform = 'scale(1.3)';});button.addEventListener('mouseleave', () => {    button.style.backgroundColor = '#f5c2e0';    button.style.color = 'black';    button.style.transform = 'scale(1)';});button.addEventListener('click', () => {});/* popup-sign-out-script.js */const button = document.querySelector('button');button.addEventListener('mouseover', () => {    button.style.backgroundColor = 'black';    button.style.color = 'white';    button.style.transform = 'scale(1.3)';document.querySelector('div').style.backgroundColor = '#ee2f64';});button.addEventListener('mouseleave', () => {    button.style.backgroundColor = '#f5c2e0';    button.style.color = 'black';    button.style.transform = 'scale(1)';document.querySelector('div').style.backgroundColor = '#fcee54';});button.addEventListener('click', () => {});Note:A lot of this code is completely unnecessary. It’s just used to make the page look nice and animate.The only code that matters in the scripts are the ‘click’ listeners for the buttons.Now that we have the Web Dev portion out of the way, let’s take a look at our ‘manifest.json’.{    ""name"": ""obj ext"",    ""description"": ""my ext"",    ""version"": ""0.1.0"",    ""manifest_version"": 2,    ""icons"": {        ""16"": ""./obj-16x16.png"",        ""32"": ""./obj-32x32.png"",        ""48"": ""./obj-48x48.png"",        ""128"": ""./obj-128x128.png""    },    ""background"": {        ""scripts"": [""./background.js""]    },    ""options_page"": ""./options.html"",    ""browser_action"": {        ""default_popup"": ""./popup-sign-in.html""    },    ""permissions"": [        ""identity""    ] }Note:1. The “default_popup” property of the “browser_action” is set to the“Sign In” page.2. We need the ‘identity’ permission in order to use Chrome’s ‘launchWebAuthFlow()’ method.Let’s do some actual Chrome Extension programming.We’ll start by coding the basic skeletal logic flow of our app.In the ‘popup-sign-in-script.js’, when the user clicks on the button, we’ll send a message to the ‘background’ script asking to “login”.If we get a “success” from the ‘background’ we’ll change the page to the “Sign Out” page.// popup-sign-in-script.jsconst button = document.querySelector('button');button.addEventListener('mouseover', () => {    button.style.backgroundColor = 'black';    button.style.color = 'white';    button.style.transform = 'scale(1.3)';});button.addEventListener('mouseleave', () => {    button.style.backgroundColor = '#f5c2e0';    button.style.color = 'black';    button.style.transform = 'scale(1)';});button.addEventListener('click', () => {    chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ message: 'login' }, function (response) {        if (response === 'success') window.location.replace(""./popup-sign-out.html"");    });});That’s it for the ‘popup.js’. You can close the file.The ‘popup-sign-out-script.js’ is almost identical.In the ‘popup-sign-out-script.js’, when the user clicks on the button, we’ll send a message to the ‘background’ script asking to “logout”.If we get a “success” from the ‘background’ we’ll change the page to the“Sign In” page.// popup-sign-out-script.jsconst button = document.querySelector('button');button.addEventListener('mouseover', () => {    button.style.backgroundColor = 'black';    button.style.color = 'white';    button.style.transform = 'scale(1.3)';document.querySelector('div').style.backgroundColor = '#ee2f64';});button.addEventListener('mouseleave', () => {    button.style.backgroundColor = '#f5c2e0';    button.style.color = 'black';    button.style.transform = 'scale(1)';document.querySelector('div').style.backgroundColor = '#fcee54';});button.addEventListener('click', () => {    chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ message: 'logout' }, function (response) {        if (response === 'success') window.location.replace(""./popup-sign-in.html"");    });});This file is done. You can close it.Moving to the ‘background.js’ script, we’ll create the Discord OAuth2 Endpoint that’s we’ll use for 3rd party login credentials.We’re going to need 6 CONSTANTS and 1 VARIABLE.And while we’re at it, a variable to keep track of the user’s login statusand we’ll create a function to bring all of this information together.// background.jsconst DISCORD_URI_ENDPOINT = 'https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize';const CLIENT_ID = encodeURIComponent('');const RESPONSE_TYPE = encodeURIComponent('token');const REDIRECT_URI = encodeURIComponent('');const SCOPE = encodeURIComponent('identify email');const STATE = encodeURIComponent('meet' + Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 15));let user_signed_in = false;function create_auth_endpoint() {    let nonce =         encodeURIComponent(Math.random().toString(36).substring(2,          15) + Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 15));     let endpoint_url =        `${DISCORD_URI_ENDPOINT}?client_id=${CLIENT_ID}&redirect_uri=${REDIRECT_URI}&response_type=${RESPONSE_TYPE}&scope=${SCOPE}&nonce=${nonce}`;  return endpoint_url;}Note:1. DISCORD_URI_ENDPOINT — how we get to Discord’s OAuth2 Endpoint2. CLIENT_ID — tells Discord we’re allowed to use their OAuth2 Endpoint3. RESPONSE_TYPE — asks Discord for a specific category of information4. REDIRECT_URI — where to redirect the user after giving us the token5. SCOPE — asks Discord for specific data6. STATE — helps personalize our requestWe have that last variable, ‘nonce’, created in the function.‘nonce’ is simply a string that gets randomly generated every time we need to use the Discord OAuth2 Endpoint.It needs to be different every time. This is why it’s not a CONSTANT.Let’s bring this all together.When our ‘background.js’ script gets the message to “login”, we’ll call the ‘chrome.identity.launchWebAuthFlow()’ function.It takes two arguments.The first is an object with our constructed OAuth2 endpoint and the ‘interactive’ flag of true (this allows the user to see the Discord prompt for credentials).The second is a callback function that gives us a ‘redirect uri’ from Discord’s servers. We can use a “token” delivered to us to gain access to the user-who-logged-in’s Discord data.We won’t be doing that in this video; we’re simply using this endpoint to “Authenticate” the user, not “Authorize” us.// background.jschrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((request, sender, sendResponse) => {    if (request.message === 'login') {        chrome.identity.launchWebAuthFlow({            url: create_auth_endpoint(),            interactive: true        }, function (redirect_uri) {            if (chrome.runtime.lastError ||                 redirect_uri.includes('access_denied')) {                  console.log(""Could not authenticate."");                  sendResponse('fail');            } else {                user_signed_in = true;                sendResponse('success');            }        });        return true;    } Note: In addition to checking for a chrome.runtime error, we also check that the user signed in successfully. It they don’t, an “error=access_denied” string will be found in the ‘redirect_uri’.The “logout” branch is really simple.Just flip the ‘user_signed_in’ flag to false and send a response of “success”.// background.js...    } else if (request.message === 'logout') {        user_signed_in = false;        sendResponse('success');    }We’re done.When the user hits the “Sign In” button, they’ll be greeted with Discord’s Login System.If they successfully sign in, they’ll be show our “Sign Out” page.If you would like a more in-depth guide, check out my full video tutorial on YouTube, An Object Is A.Discord Login System with Chrome Extensions | OAuth2/OpenID ConnectWritten byAn Object Is ALearning to code…Follow1 1 1 ProgrammingChrome ExtensionWeb DevelopmentGoogle Chrome ExtensionsLearn To CodeMore from An Object Is AFollowLearning to code…More From MediumColorful Console MessageSamantha MingGet Started With Vue.js and TypeScriptPer Lindström in Better ProgrammingAll You Need is TypesTal Joffe in Nielsen-Tel-Aviv-tech-blogJavaScript: Traverse Tree RecursivelyTina Luk in Dev GeniusAdvanced realtime streaming with SignalR in .NET CoreDavid BottiauBuilding a React Components LibraryTomasz FiechowskiAngular, Typescript, and DecoratorsNicholas Cunningham in Better ProgrammingA simple Node.js Docker workflowGábor Soós in JavaScript In Plain EnglishAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Microservices vs Web Services: An Overview,https://medium.com/deciphering-deadlocks/microservices-vs-web-services-an-overview-f1d4f94be7f1?source=tag_archive---------6-----------------------,"Microservices,Web Services,Monolithic,Architecture,Web Development","Microservices vs. Web ServicesWeb application development has been on the rise since the beginning of this century but cloud computing has propelled it to a whole another level. The initial phase began with the development of monolithic backend and frontend but as these applications scaled up to more components, module independence was sought by developers, zero downtime was sought by business owners and their customers.To cater to the demand web services and microservices were introduced one after another under service-oriented architecture for mobile and web applications. To know more about monolithic and microservices architecture you can read our old blog.In monolithic, the whole mobile and web application’s frontend and backend are closely coupled. The communication between application, modules, features, and functions happens internally whereas in service-oriented architecture this communication happens via web service APIs. Monolithic applications are difficult to scale up as everything is interdependent so you have to make the adjustments carefully otherwise it will impact the whole application.Microservices can be a standalone service or a function that has its own database and can be implemented and deployed independently of other services. A web service is a service provided from one application to another through the World Wide Web.Microservices vs. Web Services: DifferenceMicroservices vs Web Services. What is the difference between microservices and web services? Microservices and web services are application architectural styles that are modeled on the concept of service-oriented architecture where the applications, modules, and functions communicate with each other in the form of services.What are Web Services?A web service is a service provided from one application to another and both of them run on the same server instance.What are Microservices?Microservices can be a standalone service, module, or a function that has its own database and server instance. Microservices also have the load balancing capability which helps the application to distribute the computing load on to different replicas on other server instances. Microservices can also be used within web services but they will not be able to leverage load balancing capability on application-level hence such form architecture is avoided by web developers.Why use microservices and web services?Microservices vs. Web Services. Web services provide independence at module and feature level whereas microservices can provide independence at almost all levels such as server instance, application, module, feature, and function level. The more independence you have the easier it becomes to scale up the functional capabilities of an application and provide service to a larger user base.Why use Web Services?Web services provide independence over monolithic applications at zero additional maintenance costs as the same number of server instances will be required. Although the time to develop applications on web services architecture is little more than incurs additional cost to the project it is worth the trouble as every application needs little tweaks and fixations in the future. The web services will allow you to scale up the functionality of your application modules without impacting the other modules.Read: Backend Developer Roadmap for 2020Why use Microservices?Microservices provide more independence than web services but this independence comes at additional cost in development and maintenance. Microservices provide you endless support in scaling functional capabilities of application and user base that it can cater to.Although microservices can run on multiple server instances and can leverage cross-region replication to reduce latency in the application, besides that it also helps in disaster recovery management and load balancing surplus traffic by routing requests to replicas in other geographical regions. To know more about cross-region replication you can read our blog on AWS S3.When to use microservices and web services?Choosing between microservices and web services architecture for building a mobile or web application is a multiple factor-based decision. Following are the factors that will help you in choosing the right architecture for your application:Current Scope of ProjectAnticipated volatility in the Scope of the projectAnticipated user tractionAnticipated Computation LoadExpected uptimeComparing cost to run multiple server instances of microservices vs loss of revenue due to downtimeProjecting ROI on development with respect to business growthRead: Frontend Developer RoadMap 2020When to use web services?If you think that your application will be continuously getting new features and it will need frequent tweaks then you can use web services as well as microservices.If you think that you will have a countable user base and can afford downtime then go for web services architecture as it will be cheaper to build and run else go for microservices architecture.Web services are not an extremely fault-tolerant system hence there will be downtimes when web services fail.Why do web services fail?The web services, as well as web APIs, can fail partially or fully which may or may not cause complete shut down of the system depending on the following scenarios:Failures of InfrastructureFailures in CommunicationFailures in ConversationFor a deep dive into these failure scenarios, you can visit this blog.How a better scripting mechanism can be built to run web services?One can use the following steps to enhance fault tolerance for web services:Create a failsafe mechanism with circuit breakers for your web services.Configure web service and web API timeouts cautiously so that it’s not high enough for becoming susceptible to security attacks and not too less that customers fail to receive data when they have a slow internet connection.Track errors and error rates with loggers efficiently to find the bugs quickly.Minimize points of failures and external dependencies.Avoid single point of failure.We do recommend this blog which discusses a hypothetical web services failure scenario and how it can be dealt with elegantly.When to use Microservices?Microservices should be used only when businesses anticipate hyper-growth in user base, project scope, and computation requirements. If you cannot afford downtime as it can cause a huge loss in revenue or your use case does not allow downtime then go for microservices architecture as it is an extremely fault-tolerant system.Every penny you spent on such a dynamic and highly resilient system will be worth the trouble.One interesting fact that we would like to share is that Netflix has started its journey in 2008 to transform its complete architecture in microservices architecture and they completed the work in 2016.The engineers at Netflix created a software called chaos monkey which is responsible for randomly terminating instances in production to ensure that the implemented services are resilient to instance failures.Read: Database developer roadmap 2020The other fact is about Uber where they built more than 1000 microservices to build a system that can handle the hyper-growth in-cab bookings but it became extremely difficult to maintain such a system in terms of workload, cost to run and maintain.Hence we can learn from their experience that microservices are not a golden bullet that can kill all the problems you will have with your application. We need to choose the architecture wisely as we need to develop what we need not what we want. A real-time application needs a monolithic architecture then it needs to be you cannot fulfill its need with microservices.Where to use microservices and web services?Microservices and web services can be used in mobile and web applications of all domains but choosing them is dependent on the above mentioned factors and use cases.Where to use web services?Web services are good to be used for productivity tools, small eCommerce platforms, content management systems, and dynamic websites with a good set of features.Read: Frameworks and Libraries that are high in demandWhere to use microservices?Microservices are good for banking, financial services, telecommunications, automobile, ERP, CRM, and giant tech platforms.Who can help you in using microservices and web services?Web services are now quite commonly used in the software development industry and any good developer will be able to help you in using microservices.Microservices architecture is not simply an architectural style instead it is a complete infrastructure for faster development, deployment, monitoring, and fault management hence it is complex to build the right configuration. Only highly skilled solution architects can design such systems and medium to highly skilled software developers can work on it.Although the skill is not completely dependent on one’s experience it still plays a big role hence we will be estimating how much experience is good enough to work on microservices.We have experienced through a strict recruitment process in our services based software development company that the people who can architect a good microservices-based application are having the experience ranging from 8 to 18 years but the skill level was not the same among all age groups.The solutions architect should have at least 8 years of experience and software developers should have at least 3 years of experience in web development.Deciphering-DeadlocksDeciphering DeadlocksFollow88 MicroservicesWeb ServicesMonolithicArchitectureWeb Development88 claps88 clapsWritten byMahipal NehraFollowWorking in a leading outsourcing Java development companyFollowDeciphering-DeadlocksFollowA place for everyone to learn about software development, data analysis, data visualization, artificial intelligence.

How To Run Angular With Java API on Minikube,https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/how-to-run-angular-with-java-api-on-minikube-f5a1d1b1b697?source=tag_archive---------7-----------------------,"Angular,Java,Kubernetes,Programming,Web Development","Photo by Joe Caione on UnsplashMost of the companies are adopting some kind of container orchestration and running all their modern apps on Kubernetes. It’s always convenient to run the apps on Minikube which is a single-node Kubernetes cluster that can be installed on your local machine. In this post, we can deploy and run Angular with Java backend API on Minikube on our local machine.IntroductionExample ProjectRun it On DockerPublishing the Docker ImageCreate a Deployment and Service ObjectsHow to access deployment from the browserSummaryConclusionIntroductionMinikube is a tool that runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster in a virtual machine on your personal computer. We are going to deploy and run Angular with Java API on MInikube in this article. First, we create this project and run it normally, then we will run the same on the Docker and, finally, we create a deployment and service objects to deploy and run it on Kubernetes locally.We are going to need some pre-requisites to complete this project or run it on your local machine.Install JavaAngular CLIDocker DesktopMinikubeExample ProjectThis is a simple project which demonstrates developing and running Angular application with Java. We have a simple app in which we can add users, count, and display them at the side, and retrieve them whenever you want.Example ProjectSince we are focusing on running the whole project on the Minikube we are not going to develop this project in this post. If you are not familiar with the whole process of developing an Angular app with the Java backend you can go through the below post.How To Develop and Build Angular App With Java BackendLearn How you develop and build with an example projectmedium.comHere is the GitHub link of this project. You can clone it and run on it your machine.// clone the projectgit clone https://github.com/bbachi/angular-java-minikube.git// Run NodeJS server on port 3080npm installnpm start// Run Angular code on port 4200cd my-appnpm installnpm startRun it On DockerWe have seen how to build the project and tun the application in a normal way. Let’ see how we can create a Dockerfile and run the same application in the Docker.First, let’s create a folder called docker and place the generated war file there with the maven plugin. If you look at the build portion of the pom.xml we have a goal called repackage to place the packaged war file in the docker folder when we build the app. One of the advantages of using a separate folder is that you don’t have to send the entire application code to the Docker daemon when building the image.Here is the Dockerfile in which we copy the entire war file generated and run it with Java command.DockerfilePublishing the Docker ImageLet’s publish the Docker image to Docker Hub with this command docker push <repo name> . Before that, you need to create a Docker Hub account if you dot have one. Here is the link for it.Let’s create a repository and it’s bbachin1 in my case. We need to login, tag the image, and push it finally.// logindocker login// tag the imagedocker tag angular-java-image bbachin1/angular-java-webapp// push the imagedocker push bbachin1/angular-java-webappDocker HubCreate a Deployment and Service ObjectsA pod is a group of one or more containers that share the storage and network and has the specification on how to run the container. You can check the pod documentation here.Let’s create a pod with the below file. Before that, You need to start the Minikube on your local machine with this command minikube start and create a pod with this kubectl create -f pod.ymlpod.ymlIt takes some time to pull the image from the Docker Hub if you are doing the first time or depending on the image size. Now you can see the pod is in the running status and exec into it to explore the file structure, etc.// get the podkubectl get po// exec into running podkubectl exec -it webapp /bin/shexec into running podsDeploymentCreating just one pod is not enough and what if you want to scale out the application and want to run 10 replicas at the same time. What if you want to change the number of replicas depending on the demand. That’s where the deployment comes into the picture. We specify the desired state in the deployment object such as how many replicas you want to run etc.Kubernetes makes sure that it always meets the desired state. It creates replica sets which inturn creates pods in the background. Let’s create a Deployment for our project with this command kubectl create -f deployment.ymldeployment.ymlWe have 5 replicas in the specification and the deployment creates 5 pods and 1 replica set.deployment runningServiceService is an abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service. Let’s create a service with type NodePort so that we can access the Angular app from the browser. Here is the service object YAMLservice.ymlCreate a service with this command kubectl create -f service.yml and you can list the service with this kubectl get svckubectl get svcYou can create one file called manifest.yml to place all the Kubernetes objects in one place and create all of the objects with one command kubectl create -f manifest.ymlmanifest.ymlHow to access deployment from the browserWe have created deployment and services and now we need to access this deployment from the browser.We need to get the public IP address of the Kubernetes with this command kubectl cluster-infokubectl cluster-infoLet’s access an Angular app with this IP address 192.168.99.101 (where Kubernetes master is running)and port 30021(where the service port is mapped)with the below URLs. Make sure that you use Http instead of Https.// access the application herehttp://192.168.99.101:30021/Accessing the application in the browser with the above URL.SummaryMinikube is a tool that runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster in a virtual machine on your personal computer.We need to install Java, Docker for desktop and Minikube as prerequisitesWe can build the project with docker docker build -t angular-java-image .and run the container with this command docker run -d --name angular-java-image -p 8080:8080 angular-java-imageWe need a container orchestration engine for auto-scaling of applicationsA pod is a group of one or more containers that share the storage and network and has the specification on how to run the container.We need to push the repository to the Docker Hub and pull the image from it with ImagePolicy Always.A Deployment is a declarative approach to specify the number of instances of the application and makes it easier to scale up and down based on the need.Service is an abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service.You can access the local deployment with the public IP address of Kubernetes and the port of the service. We should use Nodeport in the service object.You can place all the Kubernetes objects in one file called manifest.ymlConclusionIt’s always convenient to use Minikube and own docker images for the local testing. We don’t even deploy in some kind of environment to test our workflow.Bachina LabsTutorials Ranging from Beginner guides to Advanced | Never…Follow51 Sign up for BB Tutorials & ThoughtsBy Bachina LabsTutorials Ranging from Beginner guides to advanced on Frontend, Backend, Blockchain, Docker, k8s, DevOps, Cloud,AI, ML.

The A-Zs of Web Development,https://codeburst.io/the-a-z-of-web-development-9b97808df1b5?source=tag_archive---------8-----------------------,"Web Development,Software Development,Programming,Writing,Information Technology","Give a man a program, frustrate him for a day. Teach a man to program, frustrate him for a lifetime.― Muhammad WaseemIntroductionAs we all know, web development is a vast and wide field that encompasses a range of career paths. Often this can be overwhelming for newcomers to the industry as they are tasked with trying to figure out which path is right for them. For example, careers abound in many fields including mobile app development, UI and UX design, game development, software testing, database administration, system analysis, and SEO (to name but a few). The goal of this article is not to dive into the details of each career option but rather to introduce newbies to some of the various technical terms that are common in the world of web development.AJAXAJAX is a tool used by web developers to build interactive web applications and enables developers to send and receive data without refreshing a web page. AJAX relies on HTML and CSS to render a markup, and JavaScript to get data asynchronously from the server.AccessibilityAccessibility is the practice of making a website or application accessible to everyone, especially people with disabilities. The benefits of making a website accessible to everyone cannot be over-emphasized. Tim Berners-Lee, the W3C Director and inventor of the World Wide Web, highlights this point in his statement that “the power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.”Accessibility is important for both the developers and users of an application and can be the difference between a product being seen as high or low quality in the market.APIAPI is a set of instructions that allows data to be shared between different software components, through making requests.Photo by Miguel Á. Padriñán from PexelsBrowserThis is a very familiar term. Simply put, a browser is a software application that enables users to access data on the internet. Some of the most popular browsers today include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and the newly updated Microsoft edge. Each of these browsers is being powered by an engine. For instance, Google Chrome is powered by V8, and Firefox is powered by Spider Monkey.CSSCSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. It is a stylesheet language that is used to describe how the documents of a page, written in a markup language(HTML), is being presented. Initially released on December 17, 1996, CSS is among the essential languages of the open web. The specifications for CSS are maintained by the World Wide Web (W3C).CDNThis simply means a Content Delivery Network. A CDN is a network of servers distributed across various geographical locations of the world. The goal of using a CDN is to have a good user experience in terms of speed and preventing a website from crashing in the event of a high traffic surge.CMSCMS stands for Content Management System. This is a software application that provides a digital solution for building, managing, and modification of a website’s content. CMS makes this all possible without any need for technical knowledge of writing code from scratch. Some of the most popular content management systems out there include WordPress, Drupal, Shopify, Joomla, and Magneto. WordPress has the largest market share and powers more than 37.7% of all websites on the internet!Domain NameAccording to Wikipedia, a domain name is an identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy, authority, or control within the internet. Breaking this definition down further, a domain name simply means the physical address of a website. According to Verisign, a global provider of Domain name registry services, there was an estimation of 334.6 million registered domain names across all TLDs at the end of the second quarter of 2016. Typically, A domain name can only be up to 63 characters long (including letters, numbers, or combination) in addition to the four characters used to identify the domain extension.Photo by Tranmautritam from PexelsDeploymentDeployment refers to all the processes involved in making software available for use. The deployment process involves different types of environments ranging from the local environment to the development environment and then the staging environment. The number of deployment environments needed to be set up in the shipping of a software depends on the structure of a project.DevOpsAlso known as Development (Dev) and Operations (Ops), this is the combination of a set of tools, people, and products aimed at delivering software at a faster pace. DevOps enhances continuous integration to provide a quality product to the end-users. Some well known DevOps tools used in this process include Docker, Github, Jenkins, and Slack.EcmaScriptECMAScript is a general-purpose programming language that can be used to build both client-side and server-side applications. It is standardized by ECMA International, which determines what new features can be added to the language. The language is also 100% backwards compatible, meaning that any code written today will be supported in the future.FrameWorkA framework is a platform used for developing software applications that comes with a pre-defined way of building web applications. The advantage of this is that the development process of an application is streamlined meaning that software developers do not need to re-invent the wheel every time they set to work. Some popular frameworks out there include Angular, Laravel, Django, and ASP.net.GitInitially released on the 7th April 2005, Git is an integral part of the Web Development process. It is a free and open-source version control system that is designed to manage both small and large scale projects. Git helps developers to track the changes made when writing a piece of code. In summary, Git provides flexibility, security, and high performance to developers.HTTPHyperText Transfer Protocol is an application-layer protocol used to transmit data between the client-side and the server-side servers. This involves the browser sending a request to the server, the request getting processed by the server, and finally the server returning an HTTP response to the Browser. The first documented version of HTTP was documented in 1991.Photo by Startup Stock Photos from PexelsIDEStanding for Integrated Development Environment, IDEs enhance the productivity of programmers by making available the various utilities required to put together an application without the need to set an application up manually. Some popular IDEs include IntelliJ, Eclipse and Visual Studio.JSONJSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, a lightweight data-interchange format. Derived from JavaScript, JSON has been adopted by many programming languages and is supported by most modern Browsers, JSON helps to easily transfer data between a server and a client. JSON is an alternative to XML.Keyword OptimizationThis is mostly about driving traffic to a particular website and involves the process of utilizing keywords and phrases on a web page, thereby making it easier for people to find content. It should be noted that a lot of research is needed to know the right keywords to use but luckily there are premium tools available that make this process easier by providing valuable data and statistics.LAMPLinux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/ Perl/ Python is a popular open-source web stack used for web application development and deployment. Open-source applications like WordPress and Drupal make use of the LAMP stack. This stack provides the flexibility needed to scale a product to meet its required needs.LibrarySimilar to a framework, a library can be described as a collection of configured data and scripts that has the end goal of automating the process of writing code. In the case of a framework (where most of the processes are predefined), a library gives you a high degree of control over how the flow or architecture of the software could be designed. Examples of libraries in the world of front-end web development include jQuery, Twitter Bootstrap, Angular JS, and React JS.MVCMVC stands for Model, View, and Controller. It is a software pattern found in almost all programming languages. The Model determines how the data is structured, the View represents the user interface, and the Controller handles the request made by the client which (typically through an HTTP request). A popular framework that makes use of MVC’s separation of concern principle out of the box is Angular (which does this by generating four separate files for a single component).MVPMVP stands for Minimum Viable Product and is the first step to take when it comes to product development. Taking this approach has a lot of advantages, especially for startups as it helps to cut costs and minimize risk in the event where the product fails. Companies like Facebook, Dropbox, Twitter, Aardvark all started as MVPs.Node.jsCreated by Ryan Dahl and released on May 27, 2009, Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Node.js enables developers to write JavaScript on the server, as well as the creation of dynamic web pages. It is used by big corporations like Microsoft, Netflix, Uber, Medium.OOPOOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. In adopting the use of objects, OOP offers advantages such as creating software that is readable, reusable, accessible, and scalable. Programming languages that make use of OOP include JavaScript, Java, C++, C#, Python, PHP & Ruby.PluginA Plugin is a piece of software component that is added to a program in order to give it additional functionalities. Some of the places where a plugin could be added include a website or a browser. Plugins are vital in the sense that they help to enhance the functionalities, features, and performance of a program.QueryA Query simply means a request made to a database to get a set of data. This can be done through a Structured Query Language (SQL).Regular ExpressionA Regular Expression (also called Regex or Regexp) can be said to be a set of strings used to match a specific pattern. Regex makes it much easier to perform search operations, especially with a very large dataset. It is worthwhile noting that Regexp is not specific to a particular programming language.RESTREST is an architectural pattern used for designing web services. A web service built on the principles of REST can be called a RestFul web service. REST supports different types of data formats including Plain text, HTML, XML, and JSON. A RestFul web service is built over an HTTP and can make use of terms such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE to perform its function.SOAPSOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol and was designed in 1998 by Dave Winer. It is an XML-based protocol for accessing web services. SOAP does not support different data formats such as Plain text, HTML, or JSON. SOAP was created to ensure the easy exchange of data between programs built on different platforms in a secure mannerSSLFirst developed by Netscape in 1995, SLL stands for Secure Sockets Layer and was designed to ensure privacy and protect sensitive data transferred between different systems. One of the ways to know if a website is secured with SSL is when the URL says “https://” and not “http://”.Photo by Startup Stock Photos from PexelsTLSThe Transport Layer Security is the successor to SSL. It performs the same function as SSL with a very slight difference in execution.TDDTDD stands for Test-Driven Development and is a software development approach that emphasizes the need to write tests before shipping code to production. The purpose of TDD is to write clean and bug-free code.TDD typically involves the following five cycles:Develop and design a testRun a test and confirm the Test FailsWrite the code to pass the testRun test to confirm if the test passesRefactor code and repeat the processText EditorA text editor is a software that web developers use to create and develop web applications. Some text editors have simple features while others have complex functionalities. Selecting which type of text editor to use depends on the application that the developer is trying to build. Most text editor comes with basic features such as copy and paste, search and replace, undo and redo, and so on. Some popular text editors include Notepad++, Visual Studio Code, Atom, and Sublime Text.UI & UX DesignUser Interface (UI) and User Experience(UX) in web development are two separate concepts that work hand-in-hand and are crucial to the design process of a particular product.UI focuses on the visual aspect of the design of a product. It is the aspect that a user will interact with on a product (such as a video, document, text, images, and so on). UX, on the other hand, focuses on the overall experience of a user on a website or application. That is, it tries to focus on the emotion of a user towards a product.The combination of both UI and UX ensures that an application's user the user receives the best possible experience in terms of functionality, satisfaction, and usability; which is the desire of a successful product.Version ControlAlso known as source control, version control is a system that allows users to keep track of changes made in a file, document, or any form of information collection source. Version control is mainly used for tracking changes made to a piece of code. As the code used to build an application becomes more and more complex, the need for version control becomes important due to its ability to introduce a degree of organization and sanity to the process.Version Control can be divided into two major categories: Centralized and Decentralized systems. An example of a popular version control system is GIT which is free and open source.Photo by Christina Morillo from PexelsWeb StandardsW3C standards define an Open Web Platform for application development that has the unprecedented potential to enable developers to build rich interactive experiences, powered by vast data stores, that are available on any device.– www.w3.org/standardsThe web has come a long way to get where it is today; growing in leaps and bounds and becoming an integral part of society along the way. Due to this massive growth, it is only fitting to have independent bodies that govern the way the web works so as to prevent developers from incorrectly doing things.XSSXSS, also known as Cross-Site Scripting, is a web security vulnerability that allows hackers or attackers to infiltrate and inject malicious scripts into a web page. This is usually done through the browser by bypassing access controls such as the same-origin policy.Preventive measures that can be taken against XSS attacks include:Keeping software updatedSanitizing input fieldsUsing a web firewall applicationAdopting both Client-side and Server Side validationSelectively disabling scripts on the browserYAMLYAML is the abbreviated form of “ YAML Ain’t Markup Language”. Established on 11th May 2001, it is a human-friendly data serialization language that works well with other programming languages.ZIPZIP is an archive file format that takes up less storage and can be easily transferred to other devices. The ZIP file format permits several compression algorithms and was initially released on February 14, 1989.ConclusionSo there you have it, an alphabetized list of common web development terms that contains about 40 phrases. My intention when putting this article together was to help familiarize newbies with the terms they will most likely come across as they begin to steep themselves in the world of web development.

Material UI — Mobile Steppers,https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/material-ui-mobile-steppers-63f42f4ae0e9?source=tag_archive---------9-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Vaishnav Chogale on UnsplashMaterial UI is a Material Design library made for React.It’s a set of React components that have Material Design styles.In this article, we’ll look at how to add mobile steppers with Material UI.Mobile StepperWe can create a mobile stepper with the MobileStepper component.For instance, we can write:import React from ""react"";import MobileStepper from ""@material-ui/core/MobileStepper"";import Typography from ""@material-ui/core/Typography"";import Button from ""@material-ui/core/Button"";import Paper from ""@material-ui/core/Paper"";import KeyboardArrowRight from ""@material-ui/icons/KeyboardArrowRight"";import KeyboardArrowLeft from ""@material-ui/icons/KeyboardArrowLeft"";const steps = [  {    label: ""cat 1"",    imgPath: ""http://placekitten.com/200/200""  },  {    label: ""cat 2"",    imgPath: ""http://placekitten.com/199/199""  },  {    label: ""cat 3"",    imgPath: ""http://placekitten.com/201/201""  }];export default function App() {  const [activeStep, setActiveStep] = React.useState(0);  const maxSteps = steps.length;  const handleNext = () => {    setActiveStep(prevActiveStep => prevActiveStep + 1);  };  const handleBack = () => {    setActiveStep(prevActiveStep => prevActiveStep - 1);  };  return (    <div>      <Paper square elevation={0}>        <Typography>{steps[activeStep].label}</Typography>      </Paper>      <img src={steps[activeStep].imgPath} alt={steps[activeStep].label} />      <MobileStepper        steps={maxSteps}        position=""static""        variant=""text""        activeStep={activeStep}        nextButton={          <Button            size=""small""            onClick={handleNext}            disabled={activeStep === maxSteps - 1}          >            Next            <KeyboardArrowRight />          </Button>        }        backButton={          <Button size=""small"" onClick={handleBack} disabled={activeStep === 0}>            <KeyboardArrowLeft />            Back          </Button>        }      />    </div>  );}to add a mobile stepper.We used the MobileStepper component to create the stepper.The Paper has the paper box for the text.Then we have an image below that.Then we have the MobileStepper with the navigation buttons.We pass in a button for the nextButtin and backButton props.The next button calls the handleNext function when it’s clicked.The back button calls the handleBack function when it’s clicked.This will let us move to the next step and back respectively.Carousel EffectTo make the stepper move through the slides automatically, w can add the AutoPlaySwipeableViews component.For example, we can write:import React from ""react"";import MobileStepper from ""@material-ui/core/MobileStepper"";import Typography from ""@material-ui/core/Typography"";import Button from ""@material-ui/core/Button"";import Paper from ""@material-ui/core/Paper"";import KeyboardArrowRight from ""@material-ui/icons/KeyboardArrowRight"";import KeyboardArrowLeft from ""@material-ui/icons/KeyboardArrowLeft"";import SwipeableViews from ""react-swipeable-views"";import { autoPlay } from ""react-swipeable-views-utils"";const AutoPlaySwipeableViews = autoPlay(SwipeableViews);const steps = [  {    label: ""cat 1"",    imgPath: ""http://placekitten.com/200/200""  },  {    label: ""cat 2"",    imgPath: ""http://placekitten.com/199/199""  },  {    label: ""cat 3"",    imgPath: ""http://placekitten.com/201/201""  }];export default function App() {  const [activeStep, setActiveStep] = React.useState(0);  const maxSteps = steps.length;  const handleNext = () => {    setActiveStep(prevActiveStep => prevActiveStep + 1);  };  const handleBack = () => {    setActiveStep(prevActiveStep => prevActiveStep - 1);  };  const handleStepChange = step => {    setActiveStep(step);  };  return (    <div>      <Paper square elevation={0}>        <Typography>{steps[activeStep].label}</Typography>      </Paper>      <AutoPlaySwipeableViews        axis=""x""        index={activeStep}        onChangeIndex={handleStepChange}        enableMouseEvents      >        {steps.map((step, index) => (          <div key={step.label}>            {Math.abs(activeStep - index) <= 2 ? (              <img src={step.imgPath} alt={step.label} />            ) : null}          </div>        ))}      </AutoPlaySwipeableViews>      <MobileStepper        steps={maxSteps}        position=""static""        variant=""text""        activeStep={activeStep}        nextButton={          <Button            size=""small""            onClick={handleNext}            disabled={activeStep === maxSteps - 1}          >            Next            <KeyboardArrowRight />          </Button>        }        backButton={          <Button size=""small"" onClick={handleBack} disabled={activeStep === 0}>            <KeyboardArrowLeft />            Back          </Button>        }      />    </div>  );}to make the slides autoplay.We added the react-swipeable-views and react-swipeable-views-utils libraries to let us add the autoplay capabilities.The AutoPlaySwipeableViews component we created from those libraries are added to our JSX code to make the view autoplay.Progress BarWe can add a progress bar if we have many steps.To add a stepper with a progress bar, we can write:import React from ""react"";import MobileStepper from ""@material-ui/core/MobileStepper"";import Button from ""@material-ui/core/Button"";import KeyboardArrowRight from ""@material-ui/icons/KeyboardArrowRight"";import KeyboardArrowLeft from ""@material-ui/icons/KeyboardArrowLeft"";export default function App() {  const [activeStep, setActiveStep] = React.useState(0);  const handleNext = () => {    setActiveStep(prevActiveStep => prevActiveStep + 1);  };  const handleBack = () => {    setActiveStep(prevActiveStep => prevActiveStep - 1);  };  return (    <MobileStepper      variant=""progress""      steps={10}      position=""static""      activeStep={activeStep}      nextButton={        <Button size=""small"" onClick={handleNext} disabled={activeStep === 9}>          Next          <KeyboardArrowRight />        </Button>      }      backButton={        <Button size=""small"" onClick={handleBack} disabled={activeStep === 0}>          <KeyboardArrowLeft />          Back        </Button>      }    />  );}We use the MobileStepper component again.The nextButton and backButton props are the same.The difference is that we have the steps prop.We also have to disable the buttons when we reach the max step number for the next button.And we do the same when we meet the min step number for the back button.Photo by Louis Hansel @shotsoflouis on UnsplashConclusionWe can add mobile steppers for carousels or add a more compact stepper component.JavaScript In Plain EnglishDid you know that we have three publications and a YouTube channel?

"Bootcrap 5, and the Derp Goes On…",https://medium.com/@deathshadow/bootcrap-5-and-the-derp-goes-on-e2d8be2c5c1e?source=tag_archive---------10-----------------------,"Bootstrap,HTML,CSS,Web Development,Framework","With the alpha of Bootstrap 5 now available, we get to see once again just how mind-numbingly stupid these types of front-end frameworks are. It is plainly apparent the people who CREATE these types of systems are unqualified to flap their yap on the topic of writing HTML, much less tell others how to do so.As I said in my article “HTML / CSS frameworks — Monuments to Ignorance, Incompetence, and Ineptitude.” the very nature by which these frameworks do things is the antithesis of how you’re supposed to be using HTML and CSS.So What’s Wrong With How HTML/CSS Frameworks Work?They piss all over the HTML with presentational classes. HTML is for saying what things are, not what they look like. That’s why certain tags were deprecated in HTML 4 Strict, why certain tags being back in HTML 5 is really stupid, and why using classes to replicate the same behavior in the markup amounts to nothing more than dragging practices back to the worst of the mid to late ‘90’s browser wars era practices.Hardly a shock these frameworks were popularized amongst those who never embraced the “strict” versions of the specifications, and instead spent most of the 2000’s wrapping 4 tranny around what was basically still HTML 3.2, and today slop 5’s lip-service doctype atop the same outdated, outmoded, ignorant practices. The “transitional” in HTML 4 Tranny quite literally meaning “in transition from 1997 to 1998 development practices”.Thus, saying something like this:<div class=""text-center text-red text-large"">Is as dumbass, broken, and wrong as:<center><font color=""red"" size=""+3"">You are defeating the entire point of CSS by saying what you want things to look like in the markup. Thus when Bootstrap goes full Gungan with:<div class=""navbar navbar-dark bg-dark shadow-sm"">They are driving the clock back to 1997.But it gets worse…What Do You Mean They’re Not Qualified To Write HTML?Just take this simple snippet from their “album” example:https://v5.getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/examples/album/<body>    <header>  <div class=""collapse bg-dark"" id=""navbarHeader"">    <div class=""container"">      <div class=""row"">        <div class=""col-sm-8 col-md-7 py-4"">          <h4 class=""text-white"">About</h4>          <p class=""text-muted"">Add some information about the album below, the author, or any other background context. Make it a few sentences long so folks can pick up some informative tidbits. Then, link them off to some social networking sites or contact information.</p>        </div>        <div class=""col-sm-4 offset-md-1 py-4"">          <h4 class=""text-white"">Contact</h4>          <ul class=""list-unstyled"">            <li><a href=""#"" class=""text-white"">Follow on Twitter</a></li>            <li><a href=""#"" class=""text-white"">Like on Facebook</a></li>            <li><a href=""#"" class=""text-white"">Email me</a></li>          </ul>        </div>      </div>    </div>  </div>  <div class=""navbar navbar-dark bg-dark shadow-sm"">    <div class=""container"">      <a href=""#"" class=""navbar-brand d-flex align-items-center"">        <svg xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" width=""20"" height=""20"" fill=""none"" stroke=""currentColor"" stroke-linecap=""round"" stroke-linejoin=""round"" stroke-width=""2"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""mr-2"" viewBox=""0 0 24 24""><path d=""M23 19a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H3a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V8a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h4l2-3h6l2 3h4a2 2 0 0 1 2 2z""/><circle cx=""12"" cy=""13"" r=""4""/></svg>        <strong>Album</strong>      </a>      <button class=""navbar-toggler"" type=""button"" data-toggle=""collapse"" data-target=""#navbarHeader"" aria-controls=""navbarHeader"" aria-expanded=""false"" aria-label=""Toggle navigation"">        <span class=""navbar-toggler-icon""></span>      </button>    </div>  </div></header>Again, pissing all over the markup with presentational classes to the point you literally are doing everything that was wrong with HTML 3.2But it runs deeper than that. An H4 is supposed to mark the start of a subsection of the H3 before it, so how the blazes can the first content-bearing element on the page be a H4?!? If we’re supposed to be embracing HTML 5 given that nice HEADER tag, where’s the flipping NAV? Where’s the page’s H1, you know, the (singular) heading (singular) that everything on every page of a site is supposed to be a subsection of? Why isn’t it in logical document order for users of things like screen readers? Why is a static image (that a UTF-8 character or even their own bootstrap icons should be handling) slopped into the markup as SVG? What’s with the button for scripted handling of something that doesn’t even warrant the use of JavaScript?!? What makes the word “album” worthy of recieving “more emphasis”These clowns cannot write even the most basic of HTML properly, hence why that entire section has NO legitimate excuse to be more than:<header id=""top"">  <div class=""widthWrapper"">    <input type=""checkbox"" id=""toggle_headerNav"" class=""toggle"" hidden>    <h1>      <label for=""toggle_headerNav""></label>      <a href=""#""><i class=""fas fa-camera""></i> Album</a>    </h1>    <nav class=""noScript"">      <div class=""jsHeightHook"">        <section>          <h2>About</h2>          <p>            Add some information about the album below, the author, or any other background context. Make it a few sentences long so folks can pick up some informative tidbits. Then, link them off to some social networking sites or contact information.          </p>        </section><section>          <h2>Contact</h2>          <ul>            <li><a href=""#"">Follow on Twitter</a></li>            <li><a href=""#"">Like on Facebook</a></li>            <li><a href=""#"">Email me</a></li>          </ul>        </section>      </div>    </nav>  <!-- .widthWrapper --></div></header>LABEL+INPUT to control the hamburger without JavaScript, logical document order we can “fix” using flex-order for the desired appearance, proper use of numbered headings, and yeah I kind of cheated by using font-awesome, but you get the idea. Even the NAV tag (though ASIDE might be a better choice) says the UA can skip those two SECTION to get to the content after. Something the use of a MAIN tag would further enhance.In practice I would never make the head expand that way, I’d make that section a modal dialog, but I’m trying to 1:1 compare here.These clowns are unqualified to write a single blasted line of HTML and it is apparent in every single one of their examples.Even their CSS LINK reek of ignorance and incompetence:<link href=""/docs/5.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"" rel=""stylesheet"" integrity=""sha384-r4NyP46KrjDleawBgD5tp8Y7UzmLA05oM1iAEQ17CSuDqnUK2+k9luXQOfXJCJ4I"" crossorigin=""anonymous"">Where’s the flipping MEDIA attribute?!? Big tip, if you see someone sending a screen media stylesheet without a media attribute, or media=”all”, you’re looking at those pesky “3i” of web development. Ignorance, incompetence, and ineptitude. Because I’m so sure that stylesheet makes perfect sense for print, aural/speech, etc.Same reason that if you see media queries with “screen and” in them, you’re looking at further 3i and code written by people who really need to back away from the keyboard and take up something a bit less detail oriented like macramé.But That’s All Stuff Bootstrap Has Had Since Day One, What Makes BS5 “Even More Derpy”?Just more of the same.Expanding the Predetermined Grid NonsensePredetermined grids for layout is one of the dumbest things possible. Media query breakpoints and grid sizes should be determined by the needs of the content, not some predefined plan that makes you craft content to the limitations of whatever dumbass framework you’ve chosen. It’s like the flawed nonsensical approach some people use of thinking specific screen sizes for mobile — which invariably leads to it being broken on ones you didn’t plan for — instead of making a semi-fluid elastic layout where the breakpoints are for the needs of the content, not the device.So them adding another class — “col-xxl-” — to the list only makes the monument taller.But worse is that it’s still based in the least accessible of all measurements.Willy Nilly Mixing PX and EMPX is a measurement that should NEVER be used for text or anything relating to text like layout and media query breakpoints! PX is a stupid measurement for anything text related and unless you have 100% control over the UA your visitors are using — something you NEVER have on websites — is an accessibility violation. The measurement that should be used — EM — has no fixed relationship to pixels, hence why whilst yes, 1 body em == 1 rem == 16px is the norm, many users — myself included — often have larger defaults. 20px in the case of my workstation and road laptop, 32px on my 4k media center, etc, etc. EM scales to the OS or browser preference without the user having to dive for the zoom, and without the risks of the layout blowing itself apart when you zoom.Which for me as a “large font” user is why bootcrap layouts are BROKEN. Especially if someone actually tries to use dynamic fonts to build the page, whilst bootcrap is sitting there squeezing out turds in the form of PX metric media queries. Like say… every single example for BS5 being broken here since they’re got PX media queries with EM fonts. If your fonts are in EM, so should your queries!EM, use ‘em!Also why the morons who say “62.5% gives you 10px” know jack **** about font metrics.Ditching jQuery Means Nothing If You Still Have JS For NothingThe above mention of hamburger-style menus and other such dialog toggles are just the tip of the iceberg. With them dropping IE support entirely 90%+ of the scripting they’ve rewritten to not use jQuery doesn’t warrant the use or presence of JavaScript. With CSS3 bringing Element:target, INPUT:checked, Element:focus-within, and a host of other methodologies to the show, there’s been NO reason for a lot of what Bootstrap does to even require a single blasted line of JavaScript. About the only thing that “needs” JS in most cases is a fill to get around the fact you can’t animate between a zero width or height and width/height:auto;… or to perhaps store the state of certain elements across page-loads and visits using cookies or localstorage.Which is why their ape-shit nutters 84k minified script is utter and total idiotic trash.JS for nothing and your scripts for free. That ain’t workin’, that’s not how you do it. Lemme tell ya, these guys ARE dumb.ConclusionBootstrap continues to be a blight upon the Internet, and the only blasted thing you can learn from it is how NOT to use web technologies. It remains the poster-child for everything wrong with HTML/CSS/JS front-end frameworks, and was created by people unqualified to tell you how to make websites in any way, shape, or form.Sites built from it are bloated, broken, inaccessible disasters… with that last part being a giant concern given the uptick in accessibility lawsuits.And despite the wild claims and blindly parroted propaganda, it is NOT “easier” than vanilla JavaScript, it does NOT make “collaboration easier”, NOR is it better when “working in a group”. That’s the marketing blurb to get buns in seats, and amounts to nothing more than a bald faced lie. If you think any of these claims of how “great” it is are true, you clearly never learned enough HTML or CSS to even form a rational valid opinion.Written byJason KnightFollow2 2 2 BootstrapHTMLCSSWeb DevelopmentFrameworkMore from Jason KnightFollowMore From MediumMapping Code Violations in Grand RapidsKray Freestone in Kray FreestoneFlutter installation on MacOs CatalinaCong Nguyen Dinh in The StartupA New Year’s Resolution for Web Developers: Prioritize Web Accessibility in 2020Andrew Koenig-Bautista in Better ProgrammingBack to Basics: Essential Tools in ProgrammingJulie Delda in The StartupCharacter Encodings —The Pain That Won’t Go Away, Part 1/3: Non-UnicodeRandy Au in Better ProgrammingIndex Your App Content With Core SpotlightAvi Tsadok in Better ProgrammingThe Life-Changing Magic of Finding Things Out For Yourself!Matt RudgeGenerics and Augmentation will Make You a TypeScript WizardIdan Dardikman in Iqoqo EngineeringAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Start a Blog With Eleventy,https://medium.com/@_elletownsend/start-a-blog-with-eleventy-41610f978da4?source=tag_archive---------11-----------------------,"Eleventy,Web Development,Front End Web Development,Blog,How To Create A Blog","Photo by Ella Jardim on UnsplashYou’ve made the decision to start a blog, but where do you go from there? Do you use Wordpress, or Medium? or should you create it yourself from scratch?When I started my blog, I knew I didn’t want the hassle of learning Gatsby from scratch to create a blog, and I was certain I wanted something clean, simple, and mobile-friendly. I ended up choosing Medium, but I kept in mind that I eventually wanted to migrate to my own site.After some contemplation, I came across this article by Iain Bean that explained exactly what I was struggling with (and you might be too). I didn’t need all the unnecessary complexity of a Gatsby site, so I decided to give Eleventy a go.Eleventy describes itself as a beginner-friendly static site generator (a program that combines templates with data to create HTML pages) that can be used to take markdown files, and turn them into blog posts. Like magic. Eleventy encourages you to build your site how you want to, and while that may seem like a little too much control, in my experience, this means you can make using Eleventy as simple, or as complicated, as you wish.I, for one, wanted to find the simplest way possible to migrate my blog from Medium, and create my own site, and I found it. So, I am going to share how I added a blog to my website in the easiest way possible, using Eleventy, so that you can too!Eleventy Set UpTo start with, you will need at least Node version 8 or higher installed on your computer. If you haven’t downloaded Node before, head to https://nodejs.org/en/, and if you’re not sure, open up your terminal / command line and run node --version. Mine currently returns v13.2.0 , as long as it’s above v8, we are good to go!Now, we need to install Eleventy, we do this by running npm install -g @11ty/eleventy in the command line. Thats it. We now have Eleventy installed and we are ready to get working.Create The BlogThere are three things we need to create to get our blog up and running: a blog post template, a blog post, and a blog “home page”.The TemplateThis will be the code structure that each of the posts on our blog will be created from, the template that Eleventy will add data to in order to create our blog post page.Create a folder to contain your blog, preferably named something like blog (I know, so creative)Create a folder, inside this blog folder, called _includes, and then open the blog folder in Visual Studio Code (or your preferred code editor).Inside the _includes folder, create a file called layout.liquid , and open this file up and add the following code:This is a mixture of HTML and Liquid Templating Language. If you are unfamiliar with Liquid, take a look at the Shopify Liquid Guide. What we have done here is create the basic HTML structure for each of our posts, and we have used Liquid variables to tell Eleventy where we want our post’s content to go. This code is just the bare bones, and you can add as much HTML as you want. This template is created to simplify the post creation process, so that every post for our blog has the exact same underlying structure, the only thing that changes is the content.Our next step is to create a blog post for our blog!The Blog PostBack in our blog folder, we are going to create a Markdown (.md) file that contains our actual blog post.Create your blog post markdown file (for the sake of this tutorial, name it something along the lines of blog-post.md)At the top of the blog-post file, add this:In-between the dashes here is something called ‘YAML Front Matter’ — We are using this to store data associated with our blog post so that we can use this data in our templates as liquid variables ( {{ blogTitle }} from our template is defined here as the blogTitle , alongside some other data we will be using later).Now that we have a post, and a template, we can run Eleventy to do its magic and combine the data (markdown) with the template, and turn this into a blog post.Open up the command line / terminal again, and run cd blog to make sure you are inside the folder where we created the blog post.Then, run eleventy to generate the blog files. You should see a folder called _site is created, which contains a file same name as your blog post markdown file (in our case, blog-post).If you look into this folder, you should find an index.html file that should look just like your layout file, but with the content from the blog post replacing the liquid variables. MAGIC! That is our first blog post created👏👏.Before we go any further, you can run eleventy --serve to locally host your blog at http://localhost:8080/blog-post, so that any further changes we make will be automatically applied without having to run Eleventy again. If you don’t use eleventy --serve, remember to run eleventy after making any changes!The BlogSo, we know how to create a blog post ✅, and we have our post template laid out ✅. The next thing we need to do is create a blog “home page” / archive. This page will be, in essence, a list of all the posts ever created on our blog.To do this, go into your _includes folder (where we created our layout file), and add a new file called homepage.liquidAdd the following code (similar to the layout file):Then, create an index.html file inside the main blog folder.Add this code to it:What we are doing here is utilising the blog tag that we included in the YAML Front Matter of the blog post. If we tag every post we create with a common tag, we can use the collection of posts with this tag (collections.blog) as a list of all of our blog posts that can be looped through using a Liquid for-loop. In the code above, we are going through every post tagged blog, and generating a list (not an actual list, but kind of) that shows the title of every post, with a link to the post, and the date the post was created.To get the posts to be listed in ‘newest first’ order, we add reversed to the end of the for loop.Now, if we look back in the browser at our site, specifically at http://localhost:8080, we should be able to see our blog post title on the home page, and if we click it, it will take us to the post itself. It may not look like much, but this is the bare bones of our blog finished!What’s next?As I said, what have have created here really doesn’t look like much, but this is where the creativity comes in. With a little bit of customisation and some styling, this can be as extravagant or as simple as you want it to be.You can add more data to your YAML Front Matter.

JavaScript Unit Test Best Practices — Names and Expects,https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/javascript-unit-test-best-practices-names-and-expects-e02540dc670d?source=tag_archive---------12-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Twitter: @jankolario on UnsplashUnit tests are very useful for checking how our app is working.Otherwise, we run into all kinds of issues later on.In this article, we’ll look at some best practices we should follow when writing JavaScript unit tests.Name Our Tests ProperlyWe should have concise, explicit, and descriptive names in our tests.This way, we know what we’re testing.Instead of writing:describe('employee app', () => {  it('returns an array', () => {  });  // ...});We write:describe('employee app', () => {  it('returns a list of employees when initialized', () => {  });  it('should calculate the pay of an employee when initialized', () => {  });// ...});We have the unit of work, scenario or content, and the expected behavior.We can have them in this format:describe('[unit of work]', () => {  it('should [expected behaviour] when [scenario/context]', () => {  });});or:describe('[unit of work]', () => {  describe('when [scenario/context]', () => {    it('should [expected behaviour]', () => {    });  });});So we can write:describe('employee app', () => {  describe('when initialized', () => {    it('returns a list of employees', () => {    });    it('should calculate the pay of an employee', () => {    });  });  // ...});Don’t Comment Out TestsWe shouldn't comment out tests.If they’re too slow or produce false results, then we should fix the test to be faster and more reliable.Avoid Logic in Our TestsWe should avoid logic in our tests.This means we should avoid conditionals and loops.Conditionals can make it take any path.Loops make our tests share state.So we shouldn’t write:it('should get employee by id', () => {  const employees = [    { id: 1, name: 'james' },    { id: 2, name: 'may' },    { id: 3, name: 'mary' },    { id: 4, name: 'john' },    { id: 5, name: 'james' },  ]  for (const em of employees) {    expect(getEmployee(em.id).name).toBe(em.name);  }});Instead, we separate them into their own expect statements:it('should get employee by id', () => {  expect(getEmployee(1)).toBe('james');  expect(getEmployee(2)).toBe('may');  expect(getEmployee(3)).toBe('mary');  expect(getEmployee(4)).toBe('john');  expect(getEmployee(5)).toBe('james');});We have a clear output of all the cases.We can also write out all the cases as their own test:it('should sanitize a string containing non-ASCII chars', () => {  expect(sanitizeString(`Avi${String.fromCharCode(243)}n`)).toBe('Avion');});it('should sanitize a string containing spaces', () => {  expect(sanitizeString('foo bar')).toBe('foo-bar');});it('should sanitize a string containing exclamation signs', () => {  expect(sanitizeString('funny chars!!')).toBe('funny-chars-');});it('should sanitize a filename containing spaces', () => {  expect(sanitizeString('file name.zip')).toBe('file-name.zip');});it('should sanitize a filename containing more than one dot', () => {  expect(sanitizeString('my.name.zip')).toBe('my-name.zip');});Don’t Write Unnecessary ExpectationsWe shouldn’t write unnecessary expectations.If there’s the stuff that’s not used, then we shouldn’t add it.For example, we can write:it('compute the number by multiplying and subtracting by 2', () => {  const multiplySpy = spyOn(Calculator, 'multiple').and.callThrough();  const subtractSpy = spyOn(Calculator, 'subtract').and.callThrough();  const result = Calculator.compute(22.5);  expect(multiplySpy).toHaveBeenCalledWith(22.5, 2);  expect(subtractSpy).toHaveBeenCalledWith(45, 2);  expect(result).toBe(43);});We don’t need the spies since we’re testing the results of the computation.So we can just write:it('compute the number by multiplying and subtracting by 2', () => {  const result = Calculator.compute(22.5);  expect(result).toBe(43);})We just test the results since that’s what we care about.We don’t want to check the implementation details.Photo by Wynand van Poortvliet on UnsplashConclusionWe should test the results rather than the implementation details.Also, we should name tests properly.JavaScript In Plain EnglishDid you know that we have three publications and a YouTube channel?

Road Map To Learn Data Structures & Algorithms,https://medium.com/the-innovation/road-map-to-learn-data-structures-algorithms-7960035fc4dc?source=tag_archive---------13-----------------------,"Software Development,Web Development,Engineering,Software Engineering,JavaScript","So You’re interested in software engineering, Full-Stack web development, or any computer related field, but you don’t know where to start? Maybe you even went to a coding Web-dev bootcamp but something isn’t clicking?Welcome to the club my friend, You my friend need to understand Data Structures & algorithms, and i’ll share my roadmap with you.A bit about meI’m originally an industrial engineer, I’ve worked in logistics and manufacturing for years. I found myself at the age of 29 with a solid job, but I wanted to learn software development, for a startup idea I had in mind. I’ve looked around and found a great Full-stack web development bootcamp in my area, applied, studied the prerequisites, went to the exam and got in.Long story short, I finished the bootcamp with a good foundation to build web applications using Javascript, React, Node.js, Postgresql etc. . But went I finally got home to start working on projects to put in my portfolio something was wrong, I knew I know the material, but my problem solving was lacking behind my skills, and after research, I found that maybe i should learn Data structures & Algorithms, and i can’t tell you how much this has helped me, NOW I FEEL READY FOR ANY INTERVIEW!!!So I’m writing this to maybe be able to help you IF you feel like me, In my personal opinion i suggest that every aspiring Software/Web developer should start here, it could save you some serious time & effort in the future. So here is my personal roadmap to learning Data structures & Algorithms.0. DO IT WITH PASSION, OR DON’T EVEN TRY.It’s gonna be hard, it’s gonna demand effort, just like anything else you’ll do in life, and if you don’t love the process, it’s gonna be harder!But this road map will help you in various ways, you’re code will be cleaner, better, faster, more scalable, it’ll improve you’re thinking patterns, and you’ll be able to ace coding interviews, because lets not forget, ALL coding interviews are about Data structures & algorithms.1. Select a programming languageSelecting a programming language isn’t the most important part but you may find it much easier to learn these concepts using JAVA, C, C++.Other languages like JAVASCRIPT & PYTHON may also be a good idea, but they have some weird parts to them and can sometimes be annoying.I went with C, although I’ve never programmed in C when I started learning, I picked it up fairly quickly, it’s a straight forward approach to any problem, don’t be intimidated, and don’t look too much, try one, if you don’t like it, try the next.2. Learn the basicsGreat buildings need solid structures. start with the basics, try to get a grip around pointers, structures, classes, recursion and dynamic memory allocation.3. Big-O notationThis is the back-bone of time complexity, it’s very useful when sorting big amounts of data, (An array of 10,000+ items).4.Intro to Data structuresNow that you know the basics, got comfortable with a programming language, it’s time for an intro.Start you’re learning with arrays and lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, heaps, graphs.Every one of these subjects has other sub-subjects in it, it may seem like a lot but don’t worry, each one of these will take you a day to understand and implement. try implementing what you’re learning on websites like codewars.com.I found a great 8 hour video on YouTube that will help you a lot, it’s called,” Data Structures Easy to Advanced Course — Full Tutorial from a Google Engineer”5.Intro to AlgorithmsAlgorithms are the harder part of the bunch, it’s not hard, but it won’t be easy.You’ll learn a dozen concepts on sorting algorithms.I’ve found two FREE courses on coursera.com, algorithms 1 & algorithms 2 by Princeton university, they are very helpful, they teach in java, but if you know C or C++ you won’t have a problem learning.Some tips for your studyingfocus, turn off every distraction for 2 hours and studyTake breaks. Most people forget to take breaks, taking 5 minute breaks drastically improves your learning process.Don’t give up. It’s a process, the beginning won’t be easy, but it’ll get easier with time.PRACTICE. Coding is like playing an instrument, if you don’t practice, you’ll never learn properly.Write summaries. Summaries are an excellent way to remember, after writing something down it’ll be much easier to remember, and refer to when needed.The InnovationA place for variety of stories from different backgroundsFollow3 Sign up for The Innovation DigestBy The InnovationOfficial newsletter of The Innovation Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

KYC for Startups,https://medium.com/@philpeinsold/kyc-for-startups-a290dbfa9ea?source=tag_archive---------14-----------------------,"Kyc,Startup,Identity,Entrepreneurship,Web Development","In times of increasing awareness for the importance of data security and strict data protection regulations, KYC (“Know your Customer”) is a hot topic for Startups. In many fields — especially if monetary transactions are involved in the process — Startups are required to implement some kind of KYC process.What is KYC?KYC is a shortcut for “Know your Customer”. In other words you need to make sure that you know the personal data of your customer like:NameAddressBirthdayNationalityPassport Number…Which data you need to collect heavily depends on your product, where your company is based, where you offer your service and the connected laws you have to adhere. It’s good invested money to ask a lawyer for a statement regarding all the necessary data for your use case.Why do we need KYC?The two main reasons for the necessity of KYC are “Anti Money Laundering (AML)” and “Terrorist Financing”. Some would argue, that tax flight plays also a rule.But there is another reason why KYC could become necessary for a Startup: Fake users. Young companies often try to increase their number of users by referral and bonus systems. If these systems are not well designed, they can be prone to fraud by fake users. To illustrate that, let’s assume a company has a simple referral system that pays 50 Cent for every user that registers via a referral link of an existing user. A nasty user could simply create thousands of one time mails or use bot networks to register new users and collect $CASH$. This can cost the company hundreds or thousands of $ (a lot for a Startup).Besides lot of technical tricks you can implement to prevent multi-accounting (maybe I will explain some of them in another article, but I want to be clear: I never found a 100% working solution and I do not think there is one!), KYC is the only way to reach nearly 100% of fake user prevention.How does KYC work?There are a lot of KYC service providers out there like IDNow, Jumio, Mati, just to name a few. By the way… I am talking about online identification, not offline ;-)Most of them work the same way and can be integrated with a little bit of coding (a few hours should be sufficient). Normally they offer up to 3 different ways of integration:iFrame: Identification process can be done on the company website or within the company appRedirect: Customer is redirected to the website of the service providerApp: Customer needs to download an app and does the verification process there.Personally I prefer the iFrame integration, because you have the most control of look and feel of the process and the user never leaves your site. This builds trust and decreases the drop-off rate.I highly recommend, that you select a service provider which uses a combination of OCR (“Optical Character Recognition”) to automatically read the data of the ID of your customer and a so called “Liveness Test”. In the liveness test users need to switch on the webcam and have to act in a certain way in front of the camera to pass the test. Additionally the liveness test takes static pictures of the user and compares it to the image of the ID. As a result you can be sure that the user in front of the computer is really the owner of the ID. Yessss… nasty Timmy cannot use the passport of his daddy anymore!In some rare cases it is necessary to do a real live test which is verified by a real person of the service provider in a live chat. This is the highest level of KYC and also the most expensive. Again, check the requirements of your case with your lawyer.The big downsides of KYCUntil now, I mainly talked about the necessity and the positive sites of KYC, but there are huge downsides too. First of all: the costs! KYC service providers are expensive and I mean… very expensive! For fully automated KYC with OCR and liveness test you need to expect about 3–5$ PER USER! For verifications in a live chat it’s between 10$ and 20$! These are real prices I got from real negotiations with KYC service providers. The best offer I got was 2,50$ per user and 8$ per user in live chat verification. If you are a skilful negotiator or if you take a huge package of verifications you probably get better offers.But that’s not the whole story. All service providers sell packages which you have to pay upfront. For example the smallest package Jumio offered me was 10k verifications for 3$ each. This means 30,000$ upfront! Not realistic for a Startup. Unfortunately, I never found a KYC service provider that offered a “pay-as-you-go” option (maybe a business idea!).Once again, let’s illustrate the issue and assume a company which knows that the customer lifetime value is 10$ and the customer acquisition costs are 3$. Cool, that would be 7$ profit per user. But if the user has to verify through live chat KYC (8$) you suddenly have a loss of 1$ per user!As if this wasn’t enough, there is another huge downside you may heard of: People don’t like to give away all their personal data! As a result, as soon as you require your users to do the verification process, a lot of them will just leave your product. You lost another customer… I don’t want to be pessimistic here, but from my experience you can expect a drop-off rate of about 70–90%!SummaryIdentifying your customers is necessary in some situations and important when you have to handle monetary transactions. It can also prevent fake user frauds and give you a better understanding of your user base.Unfortunately the disadvantages can kill a Startup, especially the price per verification and the high drop-off rates.So if you have a Startup and you think you need to implement a KYC process check with your lawyer first. If you can work around KYC, fine. If not, keep the prices and drop-off rates in mind!Written byPhil PeinsoldEntrepreneur, Software Developer, Speaker. Co-Founder of HEROcoin and herosphere.gg.

Career change ?,https://medium.com/@m_x_d/career-change-8f11fd6eac6b?source=tag_archive---------15-----------------------,"Career Change,Computer Science,JavaScript,Swift Programming,Web Development","Like so many others these days I have started working hard towards a career change. Because I have been laid off? On the contrary, I have never made more in my current job. I guess I have just reflected more on how fragile life is and what I actually want to do with the rest of my life.By education I have a bachelors degree in computer science. Right after school I worked for a short while as a programmer in a small company, making software for people with impairments.From there I moved to a bigger City and started up my own company. I was on my way to move to another country at the point when my mother died. I moved back to the small town I come from and the only job I could find was not at all related to my education or any of my passions. For whatever reason 12 years later I am still in the same job.I wanted to move on many times, but working hard shifts I never really found the energy to brush up on my skills, brush up on my CV, learning all the cool new tools… The irony right now is that I have never worked more in my current job and I have never had more tasks on my off-time. Despite all that I have a new-found passion that makes me get out of bed to learn.I brush up on old skills and learn new ones. Not always sure what I need to prioritise, but always determined to learn more and perfect my skills. HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, React, Swift. I learn it all. When my brain feels drowsy after studying one thing, I move to the next.So how did I acquire this passion? If I knew I’d tell you. I think with everything going on right now it has finally sunk in that life is too short. Too short to be stuck in a job I am not passionate about. I feel like I need to die or evolve. I feel an urgency I have never felt before. Did it come from all my twitter doom-scrolling? Did it come out of the raging pandemic? To be honest, I don’t know. It seems everybody is “moving to tech” these days. Am I just following the trend?Whatever the reasons. Now is as good a time as any. Follow me in this. Find your passion and give it all you got. Don’t be afraid of failing. If you don’t aim for your passions with everything you got, you have already failed.Written byJan Inge SaltskårWorking hard towards a career changeFollow42 42 42 Career ChangeComputer ScienceJavaScriptSwift ProgrammingWeb DevelopmentMore from Jan Inge SaltskårFollowWorking hard towards a career changeMore From MediumNavigate Change In Uncertain TimesMichele AttiasGenerosity, The Forgotten Key To SurvivalHelen Cassidy Page in The NarrativeCognitive Journaling: A Systematic Method to Overcome Negative BeliefsRichard Ragnarson, MD, Psychiatrist in Better HumansIf It Makes You Unhappy, Get Rid of ItViggy Hampton, MPH in Age of AwarenessLessons From Dating That Changed My LifeMatt LillywhiteThe Real Impact of Your BeliefsJean-marc Buchert in Live Your Life On PurposeDon’t Let Fear of Failure Control Your LifeRic Burnett in The AscentHands OffBeth Bruno in Wise Woman WithinAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

DevWell. Learn to Code for Free.,https://medium.com/devwell/devwell-learn-to-code-for-free-959237a7e642?source=tag_archive---------18-----------------------,"JavaScript,Web Development,Coding,Learn To Code,Codingbootcamp","We’re pleased to announce the launch of DevWell.For the foreseeable future, we’re offering completely free mentorship, live-sessions, and job placement support for those who want to learn to code but can’t currently afford tuition — no strings attached.If you’re thinking about going into debt to attend a coding bootcamp, it’s likely that you can achieve the goals you think the bootcamp will facilitate without taking on debt.Learning to code is a tacit endeavor which means the bulk of the learning process has to occur on your own by building projects, writing code, making mistakes, banging your head against a proverbial wall, digging through documentation, writing more code … rinsing and repeating. A Bootcamp can’t do that for you.The value bootcamps provide are in four main areas:Trust in the Path: Many new learners don’t know whether the myriad of free curricula is sufficient. With so many things to learn, a bootcamp can give you confidence that you’re learning the ‘right’ things.Support and Community: When you’re stuck, there are people to turn to that you trust. When you want to quit, there are people who’ll convince you to stick with it.Interview and Resume Prep: While it’s entirely possible to land a job on your own, it’s easier when experienced developers can point you in the right direction, in regards to how to prep and construct your resume.Skin in the Game: You have to make a financial commitment and carve out 15–25 hours per week of your life. Being committed makes it less likely you’ll quit — you will want to quit at some point in the learning experience.DevWell will aim to replicate a large part of that value at no cost by:Pointing learners to completely free but world-class and proven curricula available from freecodecamp.org, Google, Coursera, EdX, Khan Academy etc … in many cases, they’re equal to, or better than, what’s on offer at paid bootcamps.Supporting learners with Live Zoom sessions — open office hours and workshops — that allow learners a place to turn to when they’re stuck or feel like quitting.Aggregating resources that offer multiple perspectives on areas where new learners typically get stuck.Live sessions on interview and resume prepetc …Why are we doing it?There are a lot of people financially hurting right now. A portion of those people will be lured into debt in hopes of learning to code — for some, even debt isn’t an option. Regardless of one’s situation, there are very few reasons to pay to learn to code.While not at all wealthy, my co-founder and I do possess privilege. We would like to live in a world where privilege is recognized and honest efforts are made to remove it.That can start with our own lives.Why do we think DevWell is a useful project to spend time on?It need not cost $5,000, $10,000, $15,000 to become a working developer.We’re not saying that everyone should learn to code. Nor are we saying that, for some, paid education isn’t a reasonable option. We’re certainly not saying that learning to code will lead to a guaranteed job, especially given the moment we’re in.We are saying, that in the least, learning to code is empowering. It’s a skill that will open doors and allow you to bring ideas to life. For some, it can better their financial situation and dramatically change their life.Can Anyone Learn To Code?Most people can learn to code — there’s nothing magical about it. Most of us are glorified Google searchers.The mystique around coding causes too many people to quit. They start learning, hit an inevitable wall, begin to think that “coders” are smarter than they are, and then throw up their hands and walk away.Working coders are the ones who didn’t give up.Should I Learn to Code?This is a big question. Learning to code takes time, so if you’re not enjoying it, you’re unlikely to put in the hours necessary to learn the basics. But, if you make a start and feel like you’re progressing, then there’s no reason to think you can’t make it.A day of struggle is a regular occurrence and is often a sign that you’re being pushed outside of your comfort zone. This is an experience to be cherished.A month of toil for no reward… Maybe not so much.Where should I start?First, go register on DevWell.org and get an invitation to the Slack community. This will give you access to the free live sessions and more.Then, we strongly recommend that new learners start their coding journey at freecodecamp.org. Their resources are well organised, clearly written and, as the name suggests, completely free. We will be structuring our open office hours and workshops around the resources available there as they provide an excellent framework for learning the basics of development.Note — we are not affiliated with freecodecamp.org in any way.How Can I Get Involved?So you want to support DevWell? Fantastic!

An Introduction to HTML & CSS,https://medium.com/swlh/an-introduction-to-html-css-4084c798e5f?source=tag_archive---------19-----------------------,"HTML,CSS,Html Css,Webdev,Web Development","A beginners guide to web developmentAt the heart of any general website or web page are lines of code in HTML and CSS. HTML, the web development language to render content and CSS, which styles the content.HTML, the acronym representing Hypertext Markup Language, is the language the web browser reads to generate textual content onto browsers. This type of language is made up of components called tags. Tags define particular elements in the document and is human-readable. For example, “p” referncing paragraph, “img” referencing image, and “li” referncing list item. HTML files are saved with a .html file extension.With that out of the way, let’s dive into creating our first web page to render it onto the browser using HTML!Getting StartedWhen building anything, there are specific set of tools required. In relation to web development, the software tools to build a website are:Code Editor (i.e. NotePad++, eclipse, atom, etc.)Understanding of Basic HTMLUnderstanding of Basic CSSIntro to HTMLUsing a code editor, create a file named index.html where you will store your webpage’s code.Your basic structure in creating a webpage using html will represent a sandwich like structure.The first line of code will specify the document type to the browser that the file is a html document. The html tags can be treated like the 2 buns in a sandwich and the head and body tags can be thought of as the meat of the sandwich.<!DOCTYPE html><html>     <head>          <title>An Intro to HTML<title>     </head>     <body>     </body></html>Note : data between the head tags are not directly displayed on the the screen. The title tag is displayed on the tab bar of the website and external files such as .css and script files are placed between head (which work in the background and bring out action or style to the page). Any tags or text in between the body tags are displayed onto the screen.Type the above html code in a text editor and save the file.Once saved, double click the file and see what appears on the screen:Notice the title bar with “An Intro to HTML”Though there is an empty webpage, notice the tab with the title.Now, let’s add text to the body of the web page. Add the following code to the body:<body>     <h1>An Introduction to HTML and Web Content</h1>     <p>This is my first webpage where I will display some content to the webpage. </p>     <p>Below are the web languages I am trying to learn: </p>     <ul>         <li>HTML</li>         <li>CSS</li>         <li>JavaScript</li>     </ul></body> Some Popular Tagsparagraph : <p></p>image : <img>ordered list : <ol></ol>unordered list : <ul></ul>list item : <li></li>divider : <div></divanchor : <a></a>heading : <h1></h1> (up to h6)We have added some of the above tags to our html document.If your file is open on the web browser, refresh the page and notice what is displayed:The content typed onto the webpage is displayed and notice the content is displayed in different forms depending on the tag(s) used.CSS, the acronym representing Cascading Style Sheets, is the language that compliments the content represented in HTML by styling it into more attractive and beautiful presentation.The keyword selector is important to understand in relation to CSS. This keyword is used to finding (or “selecting”) the HTML element (tag) you want to style. At the very basic level, when using CSS to style HTML elements, the element tag is typed followed by curly braces.In between the curly braces is the detail of the specific styling method. Below is an example of CSS used to style the above index.html file.h1 {   color: red;}ul {   font-style: italic;}The above lines of CSS code will turn the heading (text inside h1 tag) red and the unordered list (ul) content into italicized.The above code of CSS will not be reflected on the html file until it is linked inside the head tag. First, save the above code into a separate css file titled style.css and link it to the html file with the following code below the title tag:<link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""style.css"">If you click on the index.html file or refresh the page, you will see the following CSS implement onto your index.html file:IDs, Classes, and CSSThere are two types of CSS selectors that are important to understand, id and class. When either on of these two selectors are used, it makes specific styling of certain tags much easier than styling by calling HTML tags. For example, there may be a case where you may want to style one item in a list a certain way, while styling rest of the items or a few other items another way.class : The class attribute does not need to be unique for HTML tags. You can have the same class attributes for multiple HTML tags. Class attributes are defined within HTML tags by typing : class= “…” (In between the parenthesis, type the class name). The syntax in CSS to refer to a class is the dot character (.).id : The id attribute must be unique for a paritcular HTML element. The id attribute is defined within a particular HTML tag by typing : id= “…” (In between the parenthises, type the id name). The syntax in CSS to refer to an id is the hash character (#).To implement class and id, let us implement the following HTML and CSS code to our index.html and style.css files.index.html file :In our index.html file, add the following class and id attributes to the list items.<li class=""basicweblang"">HTML</li><li class=""basicweblang"">CSS</li><li id=""behavior"">JavaScript</li>style.css file :h1 {   color : red;}.basicweblang {   font-style: italic;}#behavior {   color: blue;}Make sure both of your files are saved. Refresh your index.html page or open the file and you will see the following in your browser :SummaryWe see that few lines of HTML and CSS codes are at the heart of any basic webpage. HTML is reponsible for the content of the website, whereas CSS is reponsible for styling that HTML content. CSS can select particular HTML tags and change the phsyical appearance as to how the HTML content is presented onto the webpage.The StartupMedium's largest active publication, followed by +723K people.

¿Qué es el JAMStack?,https://medium.com/@maicolduque01/qu%C3%A9-es-el-jamstack-ad7a60d2736f?source=tag_archive---------20-----------------------,"Jamstack,JavaScript,Web Development,Stack","JAMStack, es un término o más bien, un nuevo Stack que todos hemos estado escuchando mucho en los último meses. El término fue acuñado por Mathias Biilmann el CEO de Netlify que lo describe de la siguiente forma:“A modern web development architecture based on client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt Markup”— Mathias Biilmann (CEO & Co-founder of Netlify).Gracias al gran crecimiento que ha tenido JavaScript a partir ES6, han surgido grandes tecnologías y frameworks que nos permiten crear aplicaciones tanto en el Frontend como en el Backend, pero también cada día nos empezamos a preocupar mucho más por el performance y rendimiento de nuestra aplicación, por eso JAMStack es es una arquitectura orientada hacia el cliente con Javascript, que permite que el tiempo de respuesta de nuestras aplicación sea mucho más rápido, debido a que hace uso del Markup precompilado, lo cual nos permite generar nuestros archivos estáticos en tiempo de compilación y al momento del usuario acceder a la aplicación los tiempos de respuesta serán mucho más cortos.Como ya lo mencionamos, el JAMStack es un nuevo stack que nos permite desarrollar aplicaciones web. Pero antes de ver que significa cada una de las siglas, recordemos lo que significa Stack.¿Qué es un Stack?Es el término con el que nos referimos al grupo de tecnologías sobre las que funciona una aplicación.Ahora si, veamos que significa cada una de sus siglas:J: JavaScriptTodo el funcionamiento, lógica y dinamismo de nuestra aplicación está orientada hacia el cliente, por lo cual JavaScript toma un papel importante y gracias a todos los frameworks que tenemos hoy en día, como lo son React, Angular y Vue e incluso con Vanilla Javascript podemos tener esa interactividad del lado del cliente.A: APIsNuestra fuente de datos o fuente de verdad son las APIs, las cuales son las que por medio de llamadas http nos permiten obtener nuestra información que será mostrada finalmente al cliente.M: Markup precompiladoHasta el momento parece que estamos hablando de lo mismo que venimos haciendo hasta el momento, que es usar en el cliente un framework como React, en el cual hacemos peticiones http hacia nuestro servidor para obtener información y luego mostrarla al cliente. Pero el factor diferenciador de este stack es el Markup precompilado, ya que en nuestras aplicaciones normales, el cliente siempre tiene que esperar en tiempo de ejecución hasta que se rendericen y construyan nuestras páginas para poder visualizar la información, mientras que con el Markup precompilado, todas estas vistas ya son construidas en tiempo de compilación de la aplicación.Un poco de historia…Antes de continuar, quiero que hablemos un poco de historia.En los años 1990 fueron los inicios del Internet, dónde todas las páginas web eran estáticas, es decir, no podíamos tener ningún tipo de interactividad con ella y si en algún momento necesitamos cambiar una imagen o parte de un texto, necesitamos que una persona con conocimientos de HTML modificara la respectiva información, este rol anteriormente era conocido Web Master.Asé se veían esas primeras páginas web:Para lograr tener una interactividad, en los años 2000 se empezaron a generar los archivos HTML desde el servidor usando tecnologías como PHP.Luego se empezó a formalizar uno de los Stack más conocidos:LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL y PHP).Este Stack funcionaba muy bien, incluso en algunos casos sigue funcionando, pero a medida que las aplicaciones crecían en complejidad el servidor no tenía muy buenos tiempos de respuesta y era factible sufrir ataques de denegación de servicio o DDoS (por sus siglas en inglés, Distributed Denial of Service) por lo cuál la solución era aumentar la cantidad de servidores que respondían las peticiones de los clientes.En la anterior imagen podemos ver el flujo tradicional de como se generaban las páginas web, en el cual cada petición hecha por el cliente debía ser procesada por el servidor, el cual para retornar la información debe hacer consultas a la base de datos y luego por medio de su motor de plantillas, entrega al cliente el respectivo HTML.En los años 2010 seguíamos usando este mismo Stack, pero la experiencia del usuario cada vez tomaba más importancia, por lo cual se empezaban a usar técnicas de catching de la información, se empezó a implementar devops y otra serie de técnicas para lograr mejores tiempos de respuestas.También JavaScript empezó a tener crecimiento y surgió AJAX lo cual nos permite hacer peticiones al servidor sin necesidad de recargar la página.En 2013 MongoDB introdujo un nuevo satck llamado MEAN, el cual tiene MongoDB, Express.js, Angular y Node JS. Fue uno de los primeros Stack que empezó a usar JavaScript tanto en el Frontend como en el Backend.Luego han seguido surgiendo muchos más Stack como lo es MERN que usa React JS en el Frontend o MEVN que usa Vue JS.En el año 2017 aproximadamente empieza a surgir el nuevo Stack JAMStack el cual fue un termino acuñado por CEO de netlify en una conferencia en 2017.A diferencia del flujo tradicional, con el JAMStack tenemos un flujo completamente diferente y con muchísimas ventajas. En este flujo no se deben generar los HTML por cada una de las peticiones que hace el cliente, sino que estos se crean al momento de compilar la aplicación, lo cual nos permite tener unos tiempos de respuesta mucho más rápido, un aumento considerable del performance y por supuesto una mejor experiencia de los usuarios.Al momento de generar los templates, podemos acceder a información de cualquier tipo de API externa, ya sea de un servidor propio, de un Headless CMS o incluso archivos estáticos,Si analizamos detenidamente ese nuevo flujo, es como devolvernos a los años 1990, en donde generábamos nuestros archivos estáticos y el cliente solo accedía a ellos, solo que con la gran diferencia que hoy en día contamos con grandes herramientas que nos permiten a parte de construir aplicaciones mucho más rápidas y escalables, poder tener esa experiencia e interactividad que anteriormente no teníamos.En el siguiente gráfico podemos ver la diferencia de cada uno de lo Stack.Redes de distribución en la nube (CDN)Un beneficio adicional del Markup precompilado, es que podemos hacer uso de CDN o Cloud Delivery Networks para lograr mejor tiempo de respuesta a de nuestros archivos.Estos servidores a parte de entregar respuestas con base al servidor más cerca, también tienen en cuenta cual es el que tiene menos carga de peticiones, o el que no esté presentando bugs al momento de tratar de acceder.Normalmente los CDN los usamos para manejar archivos tales como:JS, CSS, Imágenes.Un ejemplo muy común del uso de CDN es cuando usamos bootstrap, en el cual tenemos la posibilidad de descargar los respectivos archivos JS y CSS o acceder directamente a sus servidores:En la siguiente imagen podemos evidenciar un poco como se distribuya un CDN a través del mundo, con servidores en puntos estratégicos, lo cual nos permite que dependiendo del lugar que hagamos nuestra petición obtenemos nuestra respectiva respuesta mucho más rápido, debido a que accederemos al servidor que se encuentre más cerca a nuestra ubicación.Algunos ejemplos de plataformas que prestan este servicio y con respectivas capas gratuitas son:Conclusión.El JAMSrack surge como una alternativa más al momento de construir aplicaciones web y obviamente dependerá mucho del tipo de aplicación que vayamos a construir, por ejemplo, este Stack es bastante bueno y ofrece muchas ventajas al momento de construir un blog, un sitio web personal o una tienda virtual, debido a que la información que se va a mostrar será la misma para todos los usuarios.También nos permite seguir usando nuestros Frameworks como lo son React Angular y Vue, lo cual nos permite mantener nuestra interactividad del lado del cliente y nuestra arquitectura de componentes.Espero este articulo les haya aportado un poco más a conocer sobre el JAMStack, no soy un experto sobre el tema, pero soy un apasionado por el desarrollo web y especialmente un apasionado por el mundo de Javascript.Written byMaicol Felipe Duque UrreaFull Stack DeveloperFollow9 9 9 JamstackJavaScriptWeb DevelopmentStackMore from Maicol Felipe Duque UrreaFollowFull Stack DeveloperMore From MediumWhy you should be using React FragmentsAaron S in JavaScript In Plain EnglishBringing localization into your Widget testingReme Le Hane in Wyzetalk TechZones in Dart: Big Brother Is Watching YouDmitry Elagin in Wrike TechClubFlutter Apps With AWS Amplify Backend: Part 1 — Basic SetupVennify Media in The StartupThe Flutter Clock Challenge ExplainedConstantin Stan in The StartupFlutter Apps With AWS Amplify Backend: Part 3 — AnalyticsVennify Media in The StartupAuthenticate Spring boot API with AWS CognitoKavya Babu in The StartupFlutter Apps With AWS Amplify Backend: Part 4 — StorageVennify Media in The StartupAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

Node.js Best Practices — Versioning and Security,https://medium.com/dev-genius/node-js-best-practices-versioning-and-security-a0114dcff527?source=tag_archive---------22-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Icons8 Team on UnsplashLike any kind of apps, JavaScript apps also have to be written well.Otherwise, we run into all kinds of issues later on.In this article, we’ll look at some best practices we should follow when writing Node apps.Use Semantic VersioningWe should use semantic version to version our app.It’s conventional so that many people will understand it.The version should have the major version, minor version, and bug fix version and separated by dots.So the format is major.minor.bugfixSecure Our ApplicationsWe should secure user and customer data so that we can protect our app against any attacks.Things that we should be aware of include security HTTP headers, brute force attacks, and more.We should have some headers in our HTTP response.They include Strict-Transport-Security which enforces HTTPS connections to the server.X-Frame-Options provides clickjacking protection.X-XSS-Protection enables cross-site scripting filter built into most recent web browsers.X-Content-Type-Options prevents browsers from MIME-sniff a response from the declared content type.Content-Security-Policy prevents a wide range of attacks like cross-site scripting and other cross-site injections.We can enable all of them with the Helmet module:const express = require('express');const helmet = require('helmet'); const app = express(); app.use(helmet());There’s also the Koa version, which is the koa-helmet module.Also, we can use it in the Nginx seer to add the headers.In nginx.conf , we can add:add_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN;add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;add_header X-XSS-Protection ""1; mode=block"";add_header Content-Security-Policy ""default-src 'self'"";Sensitive Data on the Client SideWe should never expose API secrets and credentials in our source code since it’ll be readable by anyone.We can check them in code reviews.Brute Force ProtectionBrute force protection should be added to our app so that we can prevent these attacks.To do this, we add a rate-limiting library to limit the requests that can be made.We can use the ratelimiter package to limit the number of times a function is called:const limit = new Limiter({ id, db });limit.get((err, limit) => {});We can write Express middleware with it.For example, we can write:const ratelimit = require('koa-ratelimit');const redis = require('redis');constkoa = require('koa');constapp = koa();const emailBasedRatelimit = ratelimit({  db: redis.createClient(),  duration: 100000,  max: 10,  id(context) {    return context.body.email;  }});const ipBasedRatelimit = ratelimit({  db: redis.createClient(),  duration: 100000,  max: 10,  id(context) {    return context.ip;  }});app.post('/login', ipBasedRatelimit, emailBasedRatelimit, handleLogin);We check the ID and email with our rate limit middleware with the id method.duration sets the duration.db is the Redi connection instance.max is the max number of requests.Session ManagementTo secure our cookies, we set a few flags.One of them is the secure flag. This tells the browser to only send the cookie if the request is being sent over HTTPS.HttpOnly is used to help prevent attacks like cross-site scripting since it disallows cookies to be accessed with JavaScript.The scope of the domain should also be changed.The domain compares against the domain of the server to which the URL is being requested.If the domain matches, then the path has to match.Once the path is checked then the cookie will be sent with the request.expires is the attribute used to set persistent cookies. They expire after the expiry date has passed.Photo by Caleb Jones on UnsplashConclusionWe should use semantic version and take some steps to secure our app.Dev GeniusCoding, Tutorials, News, UX, UI and much more related to developmentFollow115 Sign up for Best StoriesBy Dev GeniusThe best stories sent monthly to your email. Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

React Bootstrap — Responsive Tables and Tabs,https://medium.com/@hohanga/react-bootstrap-responsive-tables-and-tabs-87b257a9eb1e?source=tag_archive---------23-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Raphael Nogueira on UnsplashReact Bootstrap is one version of Bootstrap made for React.It’s a set of React components that have Bootstrap styles.In this article, we’ll look at how to add responsive tables and tabs with React Bootstrap.ResponsiveWe can add a responsive prop to make the table responsive.To make it always responsive, we add the prop without a value.So we can write:import React from ""react"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";import Table from ""react-bootstrap/Table"";export default function App() {  return (    <>      <Table responsive>        <thead>          <tr>            <th>ID</th>            <th>First Name</th>            <th>Last Name</th>          </tr>        </thead>        <tbody>          <tr>            <td>1</td>            <td>james</td>            <td>smith</td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td>2</td>            <td>mary</td>            <td>jones</td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td>3</td>            <td colSpan=""2"">larry</td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </Table>    </>  );}We can also make it responsive on specific breakpoints.We can set sm , md , lg , or xl to make them responsive on those breakpoints:import React from ""react"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";import Table from ""react-bootstrap/Table"";export default function App() {  return (    <>      <Table responsive=""sm"">        <thead>          <tr>            <th>ID</th>            <th>First Name</th>            <th>Last Name</th>          </tr>        </thead>        <tbody>          <tr>            <td>1</td>            <td>james</td>            <td>smith</td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td>2</td>            <td>mary</td>            <td>jones</td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td>3</td>            <td colSpan=""2"">larry</td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </Table>    </>  );}With sm , we make the table responsive if the screen is small.Tabbed ComponentsWe can add a tabbed interface with the Tabs and Tab components.It can be controlled which means it’s controlled by a state.Or it can be uncontrolled which means there are no states associated with it.To add an uncontrolled tab component, we can write:import React from ""react"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";import Tabs from ""react-bootstrap/Tabs"";import Tab from ""react-bootstrap/Tab"";export default function App() {  return (    <>      <Tabs defaultActiveKey=""foo"">        <Tab eventKey=""foo"" title=""foo"">          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Phasellus          rutrum fermentum massa, eu rhoncus arcu ultricies quis. Fusce accumsan          orci et egestas viverra.        </Tab>        <Tab eventKey=""bar"" title=""bar"">          Integer tincidunt semper nulla sit amet sollicitudin. Orci varius          natoque penatibus et magnis dis parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus          mus.        </Tab>        <Tab eventKey=""baz"" title=""baz"" disabled>          Fusce sit amet euismod elit. Aliquam lacinia velit a lacus congue, nec          rutrum odio tempus. Donec eu sodales nunc, in convallis elit.        </Tab>      </Tabs>    </>  );}We have the Tabs component to create the tabbed interface.Tab is the component for adding each tab.eventKey is the key for each tab.title is created for the title of the tab.disabled makes a tab disabled.defaultActiveKey is the default event key, which lets us set the default tab.Controlled TabsWe can also set the state to control the tabs.For example, we can write:import React from ""react"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";import Tabs from ""react-bootstrap/Tabs"";import Tab from ""react-bootstrap/Tab"";export default function App() {  const [key, setKey] = React.useState(""bar"");return (    <>      <Tabs activeKey={key} onSelect={k => setKey(k)}>        <Tab eventKey=""foo"" title=""foo"">          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Phasellus          rutrum fermentum massa, eu rhoncus arcu ultricies quis. Fusce accumsan          orci et egestas viverra.        </Tab>        <Tab eventKey=""bar"" title=""bar"">          Integer tincidunt semper nulla sit amet sollicitudin. Orci varius          natoque penatibus et magnis dis parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus          mus.        </Tab>        <Tab eventKey=""baz"" title=""baz"" disabled>          Fusce sit amet euismod elit. Aliquam lacinia velit a lacus congue, nec          rutrum odio tempus. Donec eu sodales nunc, in convallis elit.        </Tab>      </Tabs>    </>  );}to have tabs that are controlled by the key state.We have the activeKey to set the key of the active tab.We set which tab is active by setting keyto the eventKey of the tab.onSelect will let us set key to the eventKey value of the active tab when a tab is clicked.No AnimationWe can disable animation with the transition set to false .For instance, we can write:import React from ""react"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";import Tabs from ""react-bootstrap/Tabs"";import Tab from ""react-bootstrap/Tab"";export default function App() {  return (    <>      <Tabs defaultActiveKey=""foo"" transition={false}>        <Tab eventKey=""foo"" title=""foo"">          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

So I taught myself how to code…,https://medium.com/@janitadacosta/so-i-taught-myself-how-to-code-786bed02052c?source=tag_archive---------24-----------------------,"Code,Front End Development,Web Development,Learning To Code,Tech","If I had to describe my journey in three words, I would say it has been challenging, frustrating (at times) and rewarding.Last year if someone would have told me that I’d be into web development and learn how to program the front end of websites, I probably would have looked at them sideways, especially after I had taken a programming module during University and learnt VBA in Excel, which ended up being much more of a nightmare than it was enjoyable.How I got startedI dived into learning how to code after attending a ‘Break into Tech’ webinar in April. Initially, I attended the webinar just as a means of feeding my curiosity, learning more about the industry and to hear the experiences of the panellist, two of who I was already familiar with after having followed on social media for quite some time. My interest in UX/UI design was another reason for my attendance as I wanted to learn more about where to begin learning as at the beginning of the year I attempted to teach myself how to use Adobe XD. Throughout the online event, which ended up lasting over four hours, the conversations and information shared gave me that push that I needed and I decided that there was no reason for me to continue to stall and decided to get started right away. Before the session had even ended I had signed up to websites that offered free resources and submitted an application for a Code First Girls (CFG) programme, which a few weeks prior I had considered applying for but didn’t follow through with. Once the webinar had come to an end I began learning the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript via a short Learn to Code course.The next morning my application has been approved and days later I began CFG’s Introduction to Web Development programme which taught the fundamentals of front-end web development. After eight weekly online sessions and a completed group project, I was able to build a website from scratch. Whilst completing this course I also worked my way through the free HTML, CSS and JavaScript courses available on Codecademy which helped me to practice the skills I had been learning and give me more understanding of particular concepts. I also took courses on Future Learn to revisit areas I had covered in previous weeks and learn about User Experience (UX) and Accessible Design which I incorporated into my CFG group project. During this time I became an online course “junkie” and was breezing through resources I found online and would spend hours sat and working my way through them. At this point, the world was battling the peak of the pandemic and lockdown wasn’t looking like it was going to be lifted anytime soon, so I poured pretty much majority of my time in learning web development.As I learnt via CFG, Codecademy and FutureLearn I found that they all gave me further understanding and clarified concepts I may have not fully grasped. After a 43 day streak on Codecademy, I had completed four of their courses and moved onto learning with freeCodeCamp as I had identified areas where I wanted to improve my knowledge and practice before beginning to work on personal projects and build a portfolio of work. As all the resources and courses were targeted at beginners, I found myself quickly “perfecting” HTML as well as CSS as I covered these areas regularly and found that I always learnt something new and that I hadn’t been taught via the previous course.During my journey, after an unintentional two-week break I decided to participate in Code Institute’s 5 Day Coding Challenge to get back into the routine of coding and stop procrastinating completing the freeCodeCamp course. This again was another course which taught the basics and was extremely beginner-friendly.Now, this far into my journey I have learnt so much – not just about coding and tech but about myself as an individual.Lessons learntPatience is one of the main things that I have had to remember and implement throughout. I’ve realised that a lot of the times where I have been annoyed and stuck because a line of code wasn’t working was most likely because I missed out a letter, there was some sort of syntax error or I just didn’t read the task and question properly. Quite often it was simply because my brain read what it wanted and I didn’t do what I was being asked. Remembering patience has allowed me to not get stressed out when I encounter an issue but simply go back and walk myself through the code I had written to find the problem. It also has helped in reminding me that there’s no rush, learning takes time and it’s unrealistic to expect to master something immediately.Another thing my coding journey has taught me is that you’ll never actually know until you try so if there is something you want to do – whether that is start something new, learn, just go for it. Before I even began learning I hesitated and worried about whether I would even enjoy it or if this would even be for me which I then realised was pointless. If I continued to self-doubt I wouldn’t have developed this new skill and wouldn’t be at the level that I am now. Granted I’m still at the beginning of my journey and I even shy away from even referring to myself as a web developer, but I’m proud of how far I have come. Throughout this journey, I’ve also discovered that so many people began their journey into tech by self-teaching and this helped motivate and encourage me. If they could do it and did it, why couldn’t I?Celebrate your wins, big and small. That is another thing that I have learnt and think is important. Find joy in moments when and where you can, sometimes when working on something for ages you may feel frustrated and defeated. Celebrate when you finally crack that code, complete tasks, courses and when you finally reach that milestone or goal.Lastly, “consistency is key”. This is something everyone has heard numerous times alongside “practice makes perfect”. I wouldn’t even be able to say how many hours I’ve put into learning this new skill at this point. There were moments where I would spend all of the day working my way through tasks. There were others where I would spend a few minutes reading and answering questions and not writing a single line of code. If there were days where I knew I was going to be busy or just felt like I didn’t want to sit for hours on end and code, I would spend at the very least 5 mins to practice and recap topics. Having a balance between doing a lot one day and doing a little another helped me in remaining consistent and allowed me to still make progress.At this stage, I have decided to take a break from online courses and instead focus on applying my knowledge and skills to personal projects and maybe even participate in the 100 days of code challenge.Keep up to date with my journey here on Instagram.To anyone interested, I’ve listed the resources I used to get started along with a short description.Resources and coursesCodecademy – have a catalogue of courses and teach a wide variety of programming languages available. They offer a basic and pro membership, the basic membership is free but comes with limited access and restrictions but there are still a good amount available with a basic membership. They also have an app, “CodecademyGo” where you can practice everything you have learnt via the course online.Code First Girls – offers a range of free ‘coding kickstarter’ programmes for students, women and non-binaries and also ‘career switcher’ programmes which you would be required to pay for.Code Institute’s 5 Day Coding Challenge – beginner friendly, free resource starting every Monday requires you to complete a new coding challenge each day, you will spend roughly an hour each day watching the videos provided and completing the tasks. They also have a Slack channel for all the participants to ask questions, share work and get help if necessary.FutureLearn – free online IT & Computer Science courses. Some of the courses I did include, Learn to Code for the Web, Computer Programming for Everyone and Introduction to UX and Accessible Design.freeCodeCamp – great online and free resource, teach you to code in various areas from web design, to data analysis, after the interactive coding lessons you create projects to test your skills and are awarded a certificate once completed.General Assembly’s Dash – a free resource that teaches the basics of web development through projects you complete in your browser. They also have various courses, full-time, part-time as well as on-demand learning charged at different prices.Google – when it comes to a lot of things, Google is your best friend. The answers are there.w3schools.com – full of resources that help you learn so many concepts and programming languagesYouTube – unlimited amount of videos and tutorials to help with learning.Written byJDFollow2 2 2 CodeFront End DevelopmentWeb DevelopmentLearning To CodeTechMore from JDFollowMore From MediumWhy Self-Service Analytics Really Isn’t A ThingBill Franks in Analytics MattersSetting Up Kubernetes For Local DevelopmentAshish Sharma in Better ProgrammingIntroduction to Concurrency in Go: Gopher FarmOlena StoliarovaUsing Meilisearch full-text search engine with RailsAlexey IvanovSQL 101 for Product ManagersAllan Wintersieck in The StartupString Validators in PythonRaivat Shah in Better Programming10 Best Practices for Improving Your CSSFerenc Almasi in Better ProgrammingInheritance & Object CompositionItchimonjiAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
"Understanding Var, Let and Const in JavaScript",https://medium.com/@goodnesschrisugari/understanding-var-let-and-const-in-javascript-4a7f030c02ff?source=tag_archive---------25-----------------------,"JavaScript,Newbie,Shecodeafrica,Beginner,Web Development","Understanding Var, Let and Const in JavaScriptThere is more than one way to declare a variable in JavaScript, it uses the var, let and const keywords for variable declarations and they all behave differently. I will try to explain them and their different behaviors but before I do that, I would like to explain some concepts that you will come across in trying to understand the various variable declarations, these are Scope and Hoisting.Scope -The scope of a variable or function is the part of the code where the variable is visible or accessible. So it simply means variable access, that is, what variables do I have access to where the code is running. When a variable is not declared within a function, it is said to have a global scope, is assigned to the global object and can be accessed or referenced from anywhere. A variable declared within a function is said to have a local scope and can only be accessed inside the function.Hoisting -This suggests that before code execution all variable or function declarations are moved to the top of the code. Technically, they are put into memory but stay exactly where you typed them in your code. Hoisting allows you to use functions before you declare them, so you can doing something like this would be valid:someFunction()function someFunction(){ //do something}So now we can move on to the different methods of declaring variables in JavaScriptVar -var is traditionally function scoped, variable declared with var outside any function has a global scope and is visible everywhere. A variable declared with var inside a function is assigned to that function, it is local and is visible only inside the function just like a function argument or parameter.If a variable is declared in a function with the same name as a global variable, it takes precedence over the global variable, shadowing it. Var is function scoped not block-scoped so if you don’t create a new function, you don’t get a new scope, a block (identified by a pair of curly braces ({})) does not define a new scope, so things like if statements don’t actually create a new scope.In JS all variables defined with the var keyword have an initial value of “undefined”, this is due to hoisting which puts them in the memory with an initial value of undefined.Var is a less than ideal way to create a variable as you can redeclare a variable that has already been created and not get an error.Using varLet -This is a new way of declaring variables in JavaScript. It is the block-scoped version of Var. Block means anything surrounded by curly braces {}. So with let, things like if statements and for loops create new scopes. Defining a variable outside a function using let unlike var doesn’t create a global variable. A variable declared using let can be reassigned just like with var but it can’t be redeclared, trying to redeclare a variable created using let will return an error. like var, variables declared using let are also hoisted but uninitialized variables don’t have an initial value of “undefined”. With let, when you reference uninitialized variable, you get a ReferenceError.Using letConst -This keyword is used to declare constants i.e. variables that are not going to change. Variables created using const can’t be changed or reassigned to a different value. It doesn’t provide immutability, it just makes sure that the reference can’t be changed; that is to say, that with constant you can change the properties of the constant if it an object, you just can’t reassign the variable. Const is block-scoped like let. If you have anything that isn’t going to change, it should be a constant as it is a lot safer declaring it like that so that nobody assigns something else to the variable name.Const variables are also hoisted but not assigned as with let.Using constSummaryVar is function scoped and an uninitialized var variable is assigned the value of undefined. Let and const were introduced in ES6, they are both block-scoped and can’t be redeclared, trying to access an uninitialized const or let variable will return a ReferenceError. Variables declared with let can be reassigned but with const, they can’t be.Written byChris-Ugari GoodnessFront-end Developer.

"The What, Why, and How’s of Sassing — instead of CSSing",https://medium.com/@logflume_14766/the-what-why-and-hows-of-sassing-instead-of-cssing-af7414b1ee95?source=tag_archive---------26-----------------------,"Web Development,Sass,CSS,Scss,Web Design","What is Sass anyway?For those who don’t know, Sass is a preprocessor scripting language which compiles to CSS while enabling more functional and efficient CSS authoring. Originally released in 2006 by Hampton Catlin, Sass is aptly short for ‘Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets’. Some of the many benefits it brings to CSS authoring include:Style nestingVariablesMixinsExtendsImportsSass can run on most operating systems including Mac, Windows, and Linux, and is completely compatible with all versions of CSS and most modern IDE’s.Why I never dove inI originally stumbled across Sass back in 2014 while casually consuming online web development tutorials. I was somewhat new to HTML and CSS at the time, but after a brief dip into a few Sass introductions, I ultimately proceeded to mentally shelve the whole thing until I had more time to dig in. A big reason I decided that I didn’t have the time to keep unpacking Sass was because I found out that it utilized new syntax and (slightly) more advanced programming concepts. Since then, I’ve been writing pure CSS for many projects throughout the years, and although I heard other developers mention that they prefer using Sass & SCSS, I never came back to spend the full ten minutes it takes to understand it and start reaping the benefits myself.Until that is, a few weeks ago, when I was re-introduced to Sass through my full-stack web development bootcamp course at Lighthouse Labs. The funny thing is, this time there was no intimidating syntax — because what was being used was plain old CSS syntax!.Instant RegretAs it turns out, somewhere along the way, Sass introduced a different syntax and format for delivering the same features, written in SCSS. This could have been a game-changer, and had I adopted it sooner, it would have saved a lot of time and money over the years, simply because of the speed benefits Sass has over pure CSS. So if you’re like I was, and you still write plain CSS — stop doing it!How? you might ask? Well, unlike I had originally thought, it’s super easy!Getting StartedTo get started, all you need to do is install Sass. If you’re on a Mac and using NodeJS like I often am, you can simply run: $ npm install -g sass. If you’d like to install it outside the command line, you can follow the Sass installation instructions found here.Once installed, you can create a Sass file such as example.sass or example.scss (the filetype is dependant on your syntax preference).Now to compile from Sass into CSS, simply run $ sass example.scss example.css. This will transform your Sass into CSS which can then be linked in your HTML.To make things simpler, you can also apply the --watch flag to designate auto compiling whenever a Sass file gets saved. Here is an example: $ sass --watch example.scss example.css. This can also be utilized on folders, not just files.How to SassNow for the ‘Syntactically Awesome’ part!Sass offers some amazing CSS authoring features, and if you’re like me, you’ll be excited to start implementing them right away. Here are a few of the key features Sass brings to CSS.NestingNesting feels like it should always have existed inside CSS. It feels extremely natural since CSS already employs the use of nesting when writing selectors, but instead of writing lines and lines of redundant selectors, Sass nesting allows for a much more clean and DRY way to write styles.VariablesLike most programming languages, variables in Sass act as storage containers, which can hold a reference to a value. For example, instead of hard coding your app colours all over the place, it’s WAY more efficient to store the global colours in variables that can then be used throughout. Now if you want to make edits to the colour down the road, you have only got to change the variable reference.Global colours stored as Sass variablesMixinsMixins are very similar to functions in other programming languages such as JavaScript. Mixins can take an argument and output styles utilizing what gets passed in. One great use case for mixins is for adding vendor prefixes to your styles. Instead of writing all those lines of code every time, you can define and utilize a mixin to handle it for you!Vendor prefix Sass mixin & timesaver!ExtendsAnother great feature that Sass has to offer is inheritance through the use of extends. This basically lets you easily apply multiple styles to multiple selectors by defining an extend with the % symbol, then including those styles in each intended selector with @extend.ImportsMaintaining modular code is simple with Sass too, since it offers an easy way to import other Sass files through @import. For example, if we create a partial file called _navbar.scss then we can import it into another Sass file like this:It’s easy to import other Sass filesOnce another file has been imported, all the mixins, variables, and extends are then available for use in the current file also by prefixing them with the file name like this: div { background: navbar.$variable-color; }.The takeawaySass is awesome, easy, and will pay dividends if you get started using it over pure CSS. It really does make writing CSS fun again and allows for an overall clean and functional way to write styling.

The ToDo App is Great for Instructors,https://medium.com/@leo_godin/for-the-love-of-doughnuts-dont-build-that-todo-app-577fedb34adb?source=tag_archive---------27-----------------------,"Web Development,JavaScript,Tutorial,Learning To Code","Photo by Markus Spiske on UnsplashSo, you want to learn a new framework. Maybe you’re just getting into web development or you’ve got some experience behind you and need a quick intro to some hot technology. I don’t know which tutorial you will use, but there’s one thing I can almost guarantee. It will show you how to create a ToDo app. For instance, look at this excellent video I used to get started with VUE.https://youtu.be/Wy9q22isx3UHow does the instructor teach VUE? First, with a wicked awesome Boston accent. Second, he demonstrates how to build a ToDo app.The ToDo App is Great for InstructorsWhy does the ubiquitous ToDo app make its way into virtually every tutorial? It’s a great way to demonstrate technology in a manner everyone understands. Each learner has the context needed to understand functionality. Furthermore, building the same thing in various frameworks makes it easier to compare technologies.In other words, building a ToDo app in YOUR tutorial is a great idea. Do it. Go for it. I recommend it. Just don’t ask learners to build the same thing you are demonstrating. Instead, encourage them to build something unique. Something that will demonstrate understanding. After all, that’s the point isn’t it? We want to teach others. We want to help them learn new technologies.For the LearnersDon’t build the ToDo app! Don’t do it. Follow along. Understand the important concepts and build something different that is as complex. Anything. Build an app to track sports scores. Something to keep notes. A schedule. A fake store. It doesn’t matter, as long as it is not the same ToDo app the instructor builds.When the instructor creates a task, you create an event or a note or whatever. When they mark something complete, you change some type of status. In other words, follow along, using the same techniques, but for your own idea and design. This will force you to think about what you are creating. No copying or wrote memorization.Why would I say this?When we follow tutorials, we are mostly copying code exactly as it is written by the instructor. Copying requires zero critical thinking. We are not understanding technology. At best, we are memorizing syntax instead of understanding how the code works. Building our own app requires us to understand how the various pieces fit together. It may take a little longer, but we will be far ahead of those who built the ToDo app. We’ll be ready to start working on more complex functionality. Of course, that begs the question, How do we learn more complex functionality?Maybe from other tutorials. Maybe from the docs. Who knows? You will when you try it. Build something. If you don’t know how to accomplish some particular task, then look it up. We live in a golden age of information. I guarantee someone has produced a video or blog post on whatever you need.What If I Want to Build a ToDo App?I hear you. You’re all, “But, you said ToDo apps are great? I want to build one. You’re not my cat, don’t tell me what to do!” Look, I get it. We love our ToDo apps. Building one is a great idea, just not during the tutorial. Once you have a basic grasp of the technology, go ahead and build it. Build it using your strategy and your knowledge. Just don’t copy code from a tutorial. Start from scratch. Write some tests. Treat it like a production app — after you’ve completed the tutorial. Now you will have the context needed to evaluate the technology. You’ll be able to compare it to similar frameworks.Wrapping UPIn the end, we want the most effective path to learning. Copying code is the least effective method we can use. Instead, we should look at code and strategies used by those with more experience than us. Figure out how all the pieces fit together and create something with it.

A Simple Demonstration of API Call using Axios,https://medium.com/@dylanoh/a-simple-demonstration-of-api-call-using-axios-594207a3e574?source=tag_archive---------28-----------------------,"Web Development,Beginner,API,Axios,Fetch Api","This is a beginner-friendly demonstration for calling an external API for your web app.The API that we are using in this demonstration is from https://reqres.in/. You do not need an API key, or anything else to perform a GET request, pretty handy for demonstration purpose.Let me first show you what are we trying to do in this demonstration.We have two buttons on the page “User Page 1” and “User Page 2”. When user clicks on “User Page 1”, we are fetching and rendering the user results of page 1 from external API, otherwise for “User Page 2”.When “User Page 1” clicked.When “User Page 2” clicked.We are going to use axios, a third party library which provides extremely convenient setup to perform API calls.Some of the benefits that I realised from axios as compared to fetch api is that:We do not have to define an extra utility function, to pass in methods, url, postData…etc. Axios provides us with predefined methods, such as axios.get, axios.post, and you can just use them.You might also realise the frustration on handling errors with fetch API, which you might not be able to catch an error when it is not technical (e.g. API does return value. but it is falsy) and end up in successful block. Well, axios is smart enough to catch that and throws the error onto your face. 😊You do not have to put in “headers” : “application/json”, I know it’s not a big deal, but yea.You do not have to parse the results to json for axios (which fetch API only returns you Readable Stream).So in this little demonstration, we are not going to discuss about the cosmetics of the website, but more towards the API call.These are the steps that I took to consider about this demonstration:Create the page structure in HTML (on how would you like them to be rendered).Some cosmetics, I use bootstrap 4.7.0 for this demonstration.Write out the functions that we shall use to call API and render the results to browser DOM.So here we have an index.html file:So in this page we have two buttons: “User Page 1” and “User Page 2” on top of the page. When user clicks on “User Page 1”, we want to display user card from page 1, and page 2 if “User Page 2” is clicked.Each user card consists of two parts: user avatar and the card body. Within the card body, there are user name and email.For design wise you may checkout the style.css, I just did a simple one.For apiCall.js, I wrote three functions:getData ▶️ call API using axios and return the data.renderUsers ▶️ to render out the user cards in cards container.Here is the apiCall.js:Those two buttons that we clicked (“User Page 1” and “User Page 2”) are listening to onclick event and fire renderUsers function. While calling the function, parameter n is also passed into the function which will be used later. I hardcoded 1 and 2 for the parameter only for demonstration purpose.So when the renderUsers function gets called, it will fire getData function and pass in the parameter (page number) and this parameter (1 or 2) is passed into the API url that we want to call. So if we pass in 1, it will get the results from page 1 and otherwise.After getting the returned data, we are going to clear the inner html of card container in order to render new cards.We loop through the data and grab the nested information that we want: avatar url, email and name in this case. You can always refer to API documentation to understand how does the data returned looks like, so that you know how to access them.Finally, we input the returned information to their respective nodes and append the whole clone body to card container.Please let me know if I can improve this demonstration or explain more in-depth towards certain things. 😃Written byDylan OhSoftware DeveloperFollowWeb DevelopmentBeginnerAPIAxiosFetch ApiMore from Dylan OhFollowSoftware DeveloperMore From MediumThe Angular Library Series - Building and PackagingTodd Palmer in Angular In DepthHow To Read An Excel File In Node.jsgravity well (Rob Tomlin) in JavaScript In Plain EnglishPhone Number Authentication with Reactive ProgrammingJinwoo Choi in freeCodeCamp.orgHow to Make Your Conditional Statements Easier to Read in JavaScriptJustin Travis Waith-Mair in The Non-Traditional DeveloperAn Honest Review of the Udacity React NanodegreeCasey Juanxi Li in The StartupPure React ModalPhil LucksJavaScript-Less Static SSR Using Styled ComponentsBayan Bennett in The StartupBootstrap a VS Code and Node.js Development EnvironmentDavid Kramer in Better ProgrammingAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Why I Switched to Fathom Analytics,https://medium.com/@micahwalter/why-i-switched-to-fathom-analytics-6715d82b0830?source=tag_archive---------29-----------------------,"Analytics,Web Development,Privacy,Product Design,Product Reviews","I’ve been using a product called Fathom Analytics since November and I really love it. I thought I’d write up a sort of mini-review of my time with the product and let you know why I think you might want to consider it as well.For a long time I had been grappling with my blanket use of Google Analytics both for my personal website and for the client projects I work on at Micah Walter Studio and of course in my previous role as the “webmaster” at Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum.As a web person, GA was always a default installation — meaning, I’d always make sure it was installed and set up for any new project I was involved in. I never really thought twice about it. Clients sort of assumed I’d install GA. They’d always send me the tracking code without much prompting at some point in the process, or I’d mention it in an early meeting to make sure it was added to the list of tasks. Because why not? GA is free, it’s comprehensive, we want to know how many people came to the website, we want to know as much as we can about everything. It’s a no-brainer, right?I’ve been using Google Analytics for years, and have made good use out of it to help inform the people I’m working with about how their site is performing, what we can do differently to achieve our goals, how we can follow user journeys — all that. I never really stopped to consider what installing that little snippet of Javascript really meant. I never stopped to consider how this little default behavior really impacted the privacy of the people visiting the sites I was working on. I never really thought about any of this at all. I’d just plunk that little code snippet in the bottom of the template and forget it ever happened.Last year I really started thinking about online privacy. I think a lot of us have. It’s obvious now the amount of private information that is being shuttled around the internet without much care. When we land on a website, and then go to another website, and go to a third website, we leave a trail. If those websites use Google Analytics or have Facebooks tracking pixel installed or some combination of the many free tools available to anyone to utilize, the companies who provide them wind up with our data, and a clear picture of who we are, what we are interested in, and what motivates us to buy is formed. It’s this picture that Google and Facebook and Amazon and many others package up into a nice product that it can sell to other businesses. When you ask the questions “what does Facebook make?” The answer isn’t a social network or a free photo sharing website for your friends and family to use together. Facebook collects and sells private information about its users to businesses. Google doesn’t make a search engine, it collects and sells private information about its users to businesses.I kept thinking about that and I realized I didn’t want to be a part of it anymore. I don’t want to feel like I was secretly capturing my visitor’s private data and sending it off to Google just, so I’d know how many hits my site was getting each month. I decided to delete that little code snippet I mentioned earlier and find another solution.Enter Fathom AnalyticsWhen I first heard about a privacy-focused product called Fathom Analytics I was a little skeptical. I mean, how can you track someone without tracking them? But the more I read about the product, the more it made sense. Fathom is protecting my website visitor’s privacy by only tracking the data that I think most people would consider to be public knowledge. Here’s what I mean.When a website visitor lands on my website, Fathom essentially does the same thing that Google Analytics does. A small snippet of Javascript captures a bit of data about that visitor and sends it to a server that Fathom owns, which in turn creates a dashboard that I can have a look at. Nice.The big difference is how Fathom is treating that bit of data. There are no cookies that tell Fathom where that visitor has been, or who they are. The IP address of the visitor is obfuscated, and the data about those visits is only shared with me. This is a really nice solution because it means that people like me who run websites can still see a picture of the kind of traffic that their sites is receiving, but without compromising the privacy of those visitors.Why pay for analytics?Fathom Analytics isn’t free. It costs $14 a month or more depending on how much traffic you intend to track. For $14 a month I can track up to 100,000 page views a month. This applies across as many websites, domains and projects I want. I’m nowhere near that amount of traffic.$14 might seem like a waste at first when Google Analytics is free, but the thing is, GA isn’t actually free. The tools are free for you and me to use, but all those happily paying advertisers pay for the product, and the real cost is your web visitor’s privacy.I prefer the idea of paying for the product directly. For $14 a month, I’m supporting a small business, and using tools that don’t compromise my visitor’s privacy — meanwhile I get a solid, well-designed product that lets me know what I need to know.Unlimited EverythingOne thing I really like about Fathom is that as long as I stay within that 100,000 page-view limit, everything else is unlimited. It’s simple pricing and it means I can use the same account across unlimited websites. I can also create unlimited goals in Fathom, and I even get unlimited uptime monitoring for those sites, which has already saved my butt once since they released the feature!I really like this pricing model. It’s simple, fair, and well, unlimited!TransparencyAnother feature I really like is that I can share my Fathom Analytics dashboard. If I want I can create a public, sharable link that anyone can go to. This is a great idea for people working on open data projects, museums looking to provide a new level of transparency or just someone like me who gets a kick out of sharing this kind of nerdy stuff.Of course, you don’t have to share your dashboard, but if you work at a company or and organization and just want to share the dashboard internally, you can easily do so with a password-protected page.DesignOf course one of the biggest advantages to using Fathom is its simplistic approach to design. There is no sidebar navigation because there is just one page. That’s all! One page of data. No more hunting through menus to find the right view, making sure you’ve got the right combination of metrics and segments selected. Fathom is super clean and simple and all on one nicely designed page.The public dashboard I share is exactly what I see when I log into Fathom aside from the billing, account and settings pages.There’s even a button at the bottom that lets you switch on or off “Show more data.” This just shows 4 more panels of information. If you don’t want to look at it, you can switch it off anytime.With GA there’s a ton of information, views, sections, options, and metrics to dive into. It’s a pretty robust product, but what I’ve found in my experience is that you don’t need most of that stuff. In fact that information overload is what makes GA so hard to deal with if you are a novice. I really love Fathom’s approach when it comes to information design. Clean and simple.AffiliatesThis is the part of the blog post where I mention that if you click my affiliate link and become a paying customer, I’ll get a little kickback, but that I’m writing this mini-review not because I want the kickback, but because I want more people to know about this product and how it could potentially impact your visitor’s privacy.Fathom Analytics has a pretty generous affiliate program. Lots of companies on the web have affiliate programs, but Fathom’s seems pretty awesome. For every paying affiliate I get 25% for life. That means if you sign up with my affiliate link and pay $14, I get $3.50. You also get $10 off your first invoice.tl;drI just realized how much smarter it is to put the tl;dr at the end of the post instead of the beginning. I hope you made it all the way down here!One last bit I’ll add is that Fathom is created by Paul Jarvis and Jack Ellis. It’s a small team, and they’ve done an excellent job writing about their journey, their process, and sharing all the ins and outs of building a privacy-focused product in this world we live in. Be sure to follow them.The short version is, if you are looking for an alternative to Google Analytics, if you are concerned about the privacy of your website visitors, if you like a clean and simple design, Fathom Analytics might be a good choice. I’ve really enjoyed it so far, and I am looking forward to having no idea who has visited this blog post.This post was originally posted on my website over here!Written byMicah WalterArt, technology, museums, design, work, photography, and writing.FollowAnalyticsWeb DevelopmentPrivacyProduct DesignProduct ReviewsMore from Micah WalterFollowArt, technology, museums, design, work, photography, and writing.More From MediumSimple Dos and (Mostly) Don’Ts for Creating Marketing Copy on a Small BudgetJoel Hathaway in The StartupThe Future Outlook for Marketing Agencies in 2019Jason SwenkConsumers Follow a Brick-to-Click-to-Brick CycleEdie Meade in The StartupWhat I’ve Learned As A Fresh Grad Marketing During A Global PandemicMarkairn in The AscentCopywriting Basics for MarketersTassia Agatowski in Better Marketing5 Ways Music Works for BrandsAndy MillerTrack Your Small Business Marketing Like Warren Buffett Tracks His Investment PortfolioJason McBride in Escape MotivationIncorporate Jobs To Be Done Framework with Buyer Personas, Up your Marketing GameMadhur Dixit in The StartupAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
"<strong class=""bt"">JavaScript: Intro to ES6</strong>",https://medium.com/@jonathan_wong/javascript-intro-to-es6-d9903026ba5e?source=tag_archive---------30-----------------------,"JavaScript,Software Development,Programming,Coding,Web Development","You’ve probably came across the term ECMAScript 6 or ECMAScript 2015 or ES6 for short. As the name suggests, ES6 is the sixth version of the ECMA script programming language and was released in 2015. To make a long story short, it refers a new set of syntax used in JavaScript and all the new functions made available. So what makes ES6 different from the other previous versions? Let’s go over some of the new features!Declaring VariablesIn ES6, there are now two new ways to declare variables! Before ES6, you were limited to using var. Now with ES6, you can use let or const. Let’s go over the difference between each variable declaration.let is used to declare a variable in which you plan or know the value which change over time. For example, a counter or a person’s bank account balance, a for loop. For example,for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) { i = i + 1}const is short for constant, which you can imagine is used to assign a constant value to a variable. This meaning that the value will not change or be reassigned.const example = “constantValue”const and let are preferred over var due to var being function scoped rather than block scoped.Arrow FunctionsArrow functions allow for a short hand syntax version of a normal function. Look below for the examples.function example (x, y) { return (x*y)}example = (x, y) => { return x * y }ClassesES6 introduced classes. Check my previous post to where I talk more about classes in JavaScript.class Phone { constructor() {  this.phonename = brand; }}newPhone = new Phone(“iPhone”)ConclusionPlease note that these are just some of the new features in ES6. Check out the link below for more information on the new features!ECMAScript 6Well organized and easy to understand Web building tutorials with lots of examples of how to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript…www.w3schools.comWritten byJonathan WongFlatiron School Alumni & Software Engineer https://jonathanwong110.github.io/JonathanWongPortfolio/Follow27 27 27 JavaScriptSoftware DevelopmentProgrammingCodingWeb DevelopmentMore from Jonathan WongFollowFlatiron School Alumni & Software Engineer https://jonathanwong110.github.io/JonathanWongPortfolio/More From MediumTop 10 JavaScript Charting Libraries for Every Data Visualization NeedRuslan Borovikov in HackerNoon.comReact/Redux Interview QuestionsEduardo Pineda5 Useful Tricks JavaScript has been Hiding from YouAlexandre Zajac in JavaScript In Plain EnglishThe simple Guide for React Native CameraKriss in JavaScript In Plain EnglishMinifying Tailwind.css with Create React AppChander Ramesh in The StartupHow To Host a Vue.js Static Website With GCP Cloud StorageBhargav Bachina in Bachina LabsQuickly Improve Your Docker and Node.Js ContainersMac Rusek in Better ProgrammingBest Open-Source JavaScript NPM Packages Available on GithubMRINAL WALIA in The StartupAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
An Intro to TypeScript,https://medium.com/@eli.kantor/an-intro-to-typescript-f88297f96e3d?source=tag_archive---------31-----------------------,"JavaScript,Typescript,Web Development,Software Development,Technology","Photo by Safar Safarov on UnsplashOverviewTypescript is a superset of Javascript. It was developed in 2012 by Microsoft as a way to quickly identify type errors in Javascript code bases plus add new features. Typescript’s ease of debugging type errors has led to a rise in popularity among developers. It is currently used by the Angular library, ranks as the 8th most popular language in Stack Overflow’s annual survey, and ranks as a top 10 language according to the PYPL Index.Stack Overflow 2020 Developer SurveyBasic ExampleLearning Typescript is very easy if you already know Javascript. In the first example below, the add function is written in Javascript and is meant to return the sum of two numbers. However, the example calls the function with two strings and therefore returns a concatenation rather than a sum. As you can imagine, this behavior can make debugging more difficult as a code base grows in size.function add(num1, num2) {   return num1 + num2}add('2','3')// returns 23Enter TypeScript…To write the same function in TypeScript first make sure TypeScript is installed. In VSCode, this can be done by:npm install -g typescriptOnce TypeScript is installed, write the same function in a add.ts file but this time declare the data type of the arguments and return value of the function. This can be done by inserting a : and the data type (number) after each parameter and the parentheses holding the parameters. Declaring the data types, or what is known as static typing, will enable the type error to be discovered during compilation.Now entering tsc add.ts in the terminal should transpile the TypeScript file into a new Javascript file: add.js. Executing the transpiled Javascript file via node add.js will then run the ‘enhanced’ Javascript file that catches the type error.function add(num1: number, num2: number): number {   return num1 + num2}add('2','3')// Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.I hope this brief introduction has been helpful.

A Simple Way to Print Certain Elements and Hide Others Using CSS and React,https://medium.com/@tyler-j-funk/a-simple-way-to-print-certain-elements-and-hide-others-using-css-and-react-b3d7679f1321?source=tag_archive---------34-----------------------,"CSS,React,JavaScript,Printing,Web Development","I was recently working on a React web app my wife asked me to make that allows her to select 5–7 meals from a long list of meals we both enjoy. After choosing sides for each selected meal, the end goal is to have a consolidated list of ingredients with checkboxes to mark ingredients you already have, and ones you’ll need to get from the store. When I got to the part where the ingredients were on the screen, she mentioned she would want to have it printed out. Except, we only wanted the ingredients to be printed out, and not all the unnecessary elements of the nav bar and header at the top. I had no idea how to do it, so I figured I would share with you all the simple solution that worked for me!To demonstrate, I’ve built out a super simple React app named PrintaBull. After throwing some text and images on the screen, I’ll target certain elements on the page I want to hide, allowing the remaining visible elements to be printable. If the print preview looks weird, I’ll address any styling issues for the printable page without affecting the web page look.Here’s what I’m working with:Yup, “bull” and “printer” infused Lorem ipsum text.Notice line 13, the <button> has an arrow function in the “onClick” which prompts the print preview to open.The app looks like this:Please excuse the silliness of the app, which is designed to provide info about bulls and printers.CSS I’ve used to this point:Print preview after hitting the button currently looks like:That’s a super important printout right there.So we got the page to pull up in the browser’s print preview, and it even politely changed our header’s blue background to white— let’s say we want to get rid of the images (not the logo) in the printout, without affecting the website images, in an effort to save ink. We would add this CSS:This allows us to not only hide elements from being printed, but change any CSS attributes for any element on the page. As you can see in the next image, we got rid of the images in our printable page, but the formatting is still off:Let’s try to get all the text on one page:If you compare this CSS to the original CSS on lines 1–48 above, all I have done is overwrite the original styling for each desired element to format the page for printing.This is our new result:Ahh… Now I have a presentable and printable page about bulls and printers.As mentioned earlier, this does not affect the CSS anywhere except the print preview/printable page. And that’s pretty much it folks! This is the super simple solution I used to print some elements, adjust the styling on others, and hide the rest. If you made it this far, thanks for reading, I hope it was beneficial for you :) happy coding.Written byTyler J FunkFull Stack Web Developer && Creative Thinker && Flatiron School Grad && Continuous LearnerFollowCSSReactJavaScriptPrintingWeb DevelopmentMore from Tyler J FunkFollowFull Stack Web Developer && Creative Thinker && Flatiron School Grad && Continuous LearnerMore From MediumBuild Offline Capable Apps With React Native and Redux OfflineMatthew Brown in The StartupCircuit Breakers in Javascript & Opossumaesher9o1 in JavaScript In Plain EnglishTesting in React, Part 5: End-to-End Testing with CypressBryn Bennett in JavaScript In Plain EnglishUpload a File with Multer in Node.js ApplicationsBewar Salah in JavaScript In Plain EnglishHow to Create Flawless React Animations with LottieReed Barger in Code ArtistryInteresting Javascript programming concepts that every developer must know.Kamruzzaman KamranInheritance in JavaScriptTyler GreasonCreating a lazy React components providerAsís García in TrabeAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

It’s something we all wish we had more of lying around. However, if you’re not born into a wealthy family or you, oh I don’t know, get incredibly lucky and hit the lottery, chances are you’re living paycheck to paycheck. Whether it be more cash in your wallet or more money in the bank, we could all use a little extra moola hanging around. I know for a fact as a soon-to-be 27 year old college student, I still use every single free resource available to me and then some.So how does this relate to Web Development? When I very first made the decision to pursue Web Development it was back in August 2017. I was working a dead end retail job at a certain 3 lettered pharmacy chain, and was super unhappy with not only the job but the pay. So I applied for a scholarship to take the Intro to Programming nanodegree at Udacity, and somewhat surprisingly to me, got accepted. But let’s be honest, if I didn’t get that scholarship I would have never been able to do it. If it weren’t for accessible resources, I would still be wandering around in retail purgatory.There are 3 main ways that developers learn to code. Some people go to college and major in Information Systems or Computer Science. If it weren’t for my admittedly awful aptitude for math beyond College Algebra, maybe I would have majored in Computer Science while in college. There’s also bootcamps, like Flatiron and Lambda but even with ISAs (Income Share Agreements) you don’t pay anything while you’re going through the bootcamp, but you end up paying for tuition 1 1/2 times over afterwards. The cheapest option (and the one I chose) is self-teaching. The barrier to enrollment in college and bootcamps can be too high for low-income individuals. In comparison, self-teaching can be accomplished with few resources and little to no money. There’s books, YouTube videos, udemy courses, local communities, and more. Below I’ll go over some of my favorite resources I’ve found useful in my own programming journey.The best books I’ve found helpful for Web DevelopmentHTML & CSS: Design and Build Websites by Jon Duckett ($13.79)Javascript & JQuery: Interactive Front-End Web Development by Jon Duckett ($22.99)The Road to React: Your journey to master plain yet pragmatic React.js by Robin Wieruch ($27.65)Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming by Eric Matthes ($17.00)Some of the YouTube videos I’ve found helpfulHTML/CSS/JS Crash Course by Colt Steele (Parts 1–4):Part 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Uauq-Gd0cPart 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5HnAlAFt40Part 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkuHUUyCKIwPart 4: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OCrKVNqCcs2.

If anyone has any they’d like to add, feel free to follow me on Twitter and shoot me a DM and let me know! I wrote this post to show that the world of Software Development doesn’t have to be unattainable simply because you don’t have a lot of money saved or lying around.

How to develop & deploy R Shiny Web Application using R Language,https://medium.com/@sanket307/how-to-develop-deploy-shiny-web-application-using-r-language-766e0d27c731?source=tag_archive---------38-----------------------,"R Shiny,R Language,Web Development,Clinical Trials,Clinical Data Management","In this blog, you will learn how to easily develop an web application by using R Shiny and R Studio. We’ll mainly use the popular shiny package that enables you to build interactive web apps using both the statistical power of R and the interactivity of the modern web. I hope this is useful to anyone wants to develop an application using R Shiny package. For further reference you may access my already deployed Shiny web application QuickCT.The basic parts of R Shiny AppThere are three main programs requires to create R shiny web application. ui.R, server.R and global.Rui.R# Define UI for app ----ui <- fluidPage(  # App title ----  titlePanel(""Hello Shiny!""),  # Sidebar layout with input and output definitions ----  sidebarLayout(    # Sidebar panel for inputs ----    sidebarPanel(      # Input: Slider for the number of bins ----      sliderInput()    ),    # Main panel for displaying outputs ----    mainPanel(      # Output: ----    )  ))server.R# Define server logic required to----server <- function(input, output) {}global.Rglobal.R programs contain your dataset creation part which will utilized in R shiny web application.This is the same basic structure for all Shiny applications.This is output of QuickCT shiny web application!About Us [tab panel] screenshot-AAdd-on Packages for ShinyshinyWidgets → It customize Inputs Widgets for ShinyCollection of custom input controls and user interface components for ‘Shiny’ applications.

Which contains tab panel. You can create the tab panels according to your requirements. Shiny package is require to create tabPanel. Tabsets are created by calling the tabsetPanel function with a list of tabs created by the tabPanel function. Each tab panel is provided a list of output elements which are rendered vertically within the tab.ui <- navbarPage(“QuickCT”, tabPanel(tags$strong(“About Us”), tabPanel(HTML(“<b>”,“Control Terminology”,“</b>”), tabPanel(HTML(“<b>”,“Feedback”,“</b>”))For About Us tabpanel please check above screenshot-ABelow screenshot forControl Terminology tabpanelSidebar panel Layout:Sidebar panel layout takes input from the user in various forms like text input, checkbox input, radio button input, drop down input, etc. It is represented in sky blue background in left section.The sidebar panel will appear on the left side of your app by default. You can move it to the right side by giving sidebarLayout the optional argument position = ""right"".The sidebar panel is displayed with a distinct background color and typically contains input controls.By accessing a QuickCT application you may check Control Terminology tab panel for sidebar panel and main panel for further reference.Main Panel:It is part of screen where the output(s) generated as a result of performing a set of operations on input(s) at the server.R is / are displayed.The main panel area occupies 2/3 of the horizontal width and typically contains outputs.#Example of creating sidebar panel and main panel -------ui <- navbarPage(  sidebarLayout(    sidebarPanel(""sidebar panel""),    mainPanel(""main panel"")  ))As per your need you can create radio button, drop down list etc. in your application.

Loan Calculator | Understanding DOM Better,https://medium.com/@sakshijjain1997/loan-calculator-understanding-dom-better-ff38ca5d3f22?source=tag_archive---------39-----------------------,"JavaScript,Web Development,Javascript Development,HTML,CSS","In continuation to understanding DOM better, let us make together a LOAN Calculator Project!To start with , open up your VS Code and name a folder: Loan Calculator. So we will be using BootStrap to build our UI in minutes. As we are more concerned with JS .So make a index.html file in your Loan Calculator folder and add required Bootsrap CDN after adding your HTML boiler plate.<! — Required meta tags →<meta charset=”utf-8""><meta name=”viewport” content=”width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no”><! — Bootstrap CSS →<link rel=”stylesheet” href=”https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css"" integrity=”sha384-ggOyR0iXCbMQv3Xipma34MD+dH/1fQ784/j6cY/iJTQUOhcWr7x9JvoRxT2MZw1T” crossorigin=”anonymous”>So how does our Loan Calculator looks like?

Hide the results section and display the loading gif by block to get that feel of UI with a timer to perform calculateResults() by 2ms .Now its time to call calculateResults():-Explanation :First Picture:- We need to grab all the UI elements responsible for input and output of the results using getElementById () .We need to apply formula : and calculate the principal , calculatedInterest, calculatedPayment and compute monthlyPayment accordingly.It is followed by if-else condition : to check if the monthly calculated is finite or not . If finite , calculate the results accordingly and display the result in block while hiding the loading.gif as display:none. If not finite , showError(‘Please check your number’) is performed.In the showerror() , hide both the results and loading.gif section as none. Then create errorGif const with a div into it in DOM , add class name to it and append the error text into it. Add error div particularly before the card heading Loan Calculator accordingly. You can also vanish the error after 3ms using setTimeOut() that will call clearError() accordingly.The clearError() will find the added class name’alert’ for errorGif and remove it instantly.And this is how , LoanCalculator works beautifully.Written bysakshi jainBecause heart screams louder than mind and we don’t listen!Follow1 1 1 JavaScriptWeb DevelopmentJavascript DevelopmentHTMLCSSMore from sakshi jainFollowBecause heart screams louder than mind and we don’t listen!More From MediumOn Exploring Promise 2: possible overlooked points about promisexullnnHow to display code coverage of a Vue project in GitlabMichaël Vanderheyden in JavaScript In Plain EnglishJS PromisesOussema Miled in The StartupProgressive Web Apps with PokeAPI and Deploy using FirebaseAmendo in EasyreadMerge Sorting AlgorithmSteven Zhu in Weekly WebtipsA Better Translation Experience With TranslocoItay Oded in Angular In DepthSuper Easy Language Translator with AWS Amplify Predictions and Vue.jsDiligent Dev in JavaScript In Plain EnglishHow to Add Scroll to Top Feature in Your Vue.js AppJohn Au-Yeung in The StartupAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

Arranging HTML items in particular shape — ellipsis-html,https://medium.com/@behnamazimi/arranging-html-items-in-particular-shaped-ellipsis-html-6e2bc6d8c6c?source=tag_archive---------41-----------------------,"Javascipt,HTML,Web Development,Front End Development","As a front-end developer sometimes you need to layout html elements is a particular layout by each other. The difficulty of this depends on the imagination of your UI designer but in general the layouting items in html without knowing the concepts and tricks is plenty challenging.Figure1: example arch arranging made with ellipsis-htmlThe most common unusual layout that I dealt with in my projects and I have seen it in many UI designs is arranging items on an arch. For example, laying in the border of a semicircle or a full circle, or arranging in the border of a semi-ellipse. To make these you need to encounter with math formula and complex concepts.Good news is that I developed a mini tool exactly for this purpose, I mean for the arranging html elements along ellipse subset shapes. I named it ellipsis-html.Using ellipsis-html you can layout child items of an element along a circle, semicircle, ellipse or any subset shape of it. You can see samples made with ellipsis-html in below figure.Figure2: ellipsis-html sample layoutsIt’s only 2KB and easy to use. I explained what you need in the GitHub readme, so you could read the readme too.Check demo here 😎You can arrange your elements in any subset shape of an ellipse with changing the options and put it in any position of your parent element.Here is the code was written to make the result that you saw in Figure 1:If you encounter any problem, bring it up as an issue or contribute to the project and fix it yourself.Do not forget to star the repo.

N/A,https://medium.com/@vebsigns/best-programming-languages-for-web-development-ea9a3b420f4?source=tag_archive---------43-----------------------,"Website,Website Development,Web Development,Programming,Development","BEST PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES FOR WEB DEVELOPMENTThe most ideal approach to arrive at new customers and keep rehash clients is to fabricate your site and keep up it consistently. Correspondence should consistently be open, and clients ought to get reactions to their inquiries in a convenient way. Furthermore, products and services should have detailed descriptions, be updated often, and revised as needed. It is vital to track sales and generate leads and make changes along the way. With that, it is basic to ace the top programming languages for web development to see organizations proceed to develop and flourish.The best programming languages to learn (and keep on relearning) include:1) JAVASCRIPTJavaScript allows for more complex and creative features on a website and mostly caters to front-end web development. This is in tune with the client’s side, in terms of what they see from their computer or mobile device. Examples include interactive displays, graphic designs, and varying modes of multimedia. It is multi-paradigm and event-based, meaning codes are executed when a user hovers over or clicks on an icon.Major companies that use JavaScript include Netflix, Groupon, Uber, and eBay. This example reinforces how JavaScript is an ideal programming language for people who are directly and regularly interacting with a particular website. As a result, the user experience is fast, with code running from each browser directly without any interruptions.2) HTML / CSSHypertext markup language (HTML) / Cascading style sheets (CSS) can go hand-in-hand, but also be independent of one another. HTML is the basic backbone and the markup language of a webpage, which has the actual content written out. Examples include texts, links, and other information.CSS is what makes a website stick out by adding color, layouts, and designs. It makes HTML language have a style and flair of its own. The two can be used when making a presentation, and are great for blogs, personal websites, and social media sites. Hence, website developers can present varying styles to different users, all while enhancing search engine optimization with greater accessibility.3) PYTHONPython is another language that is easy to understand and is very user-friendly. It is object-oriented and supports several programming paradigms. It is mostly used for back-end web development, which encompasses the hidden aspects of a website, such as the scripts and data applications. It was designed to allow additional interfaces for current applications. Examples of famous companies that usePython includes Instagram, Spotify, and Firefox. Moreover, it is perfect to use in the academic field, such as when studying image processing and data science. Due to its enhanced process control functions, it is quick in terms of speed and productivity.4) PHPPersonal home pages, or hypertext preprocessor (PHP) is a general-purpose, extendible, scripting language used for web development. The coding is executed on the server and sent to the client without them knowing of any running scripts. It runs on many platforms, such as Mac OS X and Windows, which is highly compatible with almost every server and is implemented for static and dynamic websites. It is open-source and free to use and can modify and encrypt data, control user-access, send and receive cookies, and alter server files. Companies that use PHP include WordPress, Facebook, and Wikipedia. Another advantage is it has a high-performance level, with low maintenance costs.5) JAVAJava is often a good first language to grasp, and it has been around for quite some time. Nonetheless, it remains one of the most influential and important languages to learn when it comes to web development, as it runs on over three billion devices on a global scale. It is both class-based and object-oriented, and can run on any platform (e.g., iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, etc.). Hence, it is a general-purpose programming language that is multi-paradigm.Some well-known giant tech companies that use Java include Google, Twitter, and Amazon, as well as an extensive number of other applications. Java is multi-threaded and can perform multiple tasks at once. Overall, it is a straightforward programming language with hardly any complicated features, and simple to debug.6) C++C++ is a high-performance language that is object-oriented. As a result, they are often used with applications that can direct critical issues and have a secure software infrastructure. C++ is also the programming language chosen for video games and commercial products such as Adobe Photoshop. It is also used for web browsers such as Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome and can render open-source projects and develop databases. Furthermore, C++ excels at creating operating systems such as Internet Explorer and Microsoft Office. By and large, it has multiple sets of uses and is compatible with many platforms.7) CC is general-purpose and one of the oldest yet commonly used languages in web development. It is the basis of other programming languages, such as C++ and JavaScript. It is a middle-level programming language that is versatile since it can be used for scripting for drivers and kernels and software applications. It can simplify complex programs into functions and move data across. It has many built-in features and is often used for video games, 3D graphics, and enterprise applications. Companies that use C programming include Adobe, Microsoft, and Google.When building any website, it is important to create solid content with engaging features. The software and database need to be reliable, and the interface also needs to pique a user’s interest. Thus, it is essential to understand a variety of programming languages to boost your web development and create a compelling webpage.To learn more about programming languages and to utilize the latest technologies, contact the experts at Vebsigns at +91–9970876727.

I used to mess around with HTML in the Myspace days, and I took part of a Web Developer course on Udemy that taught me the basics.What do you think about HTML/CSS now that you’ve finished this curriculum?I’m a lot more comfortable with HTML now, I found myself working way faster and making less mistakes than I was making a few weeks ago. I still need to get better with CSS, but that comes with practice.What was the most challenging part of this module for you?The most challenging part of the module was aligning content where I wanted it to go. I wasn’t sure how to position it inside the HTML or how to use Flexbox to line everything up. It’s making more sense to me now, but I still need some practice.What was the most rewarding part of this module for you?The most rewarding part was being able to build a simple website from total scratch, within a few weeks of learning. For some reason I thought it would take months to learn how to do that. It’s pretty cool knowing I can build a decent looking website by myself now.How did ROOT’s Technology coding curriculum impact your learning in this module?It helped me get the basics down. I can start working on simple websites and figure out how to get unstuck. It’s easy to code along with tutorials, but having an actual assignment to apply my new knowledge helped tremendously. It’s like taking an exam, which is what I need. I feel like I’m actually learning.Written byChad SmithFollow10 10 10 HTMLSoftware DeveloperWeb DevelopmentCSSSoftware EngineerMore from Chad SmithFollowMore From MediumHow to Implement Logging in Your Python ApplicationLeo Brack in Better ProgrammingNEuler Refresh — Perspectives-light, GDS Sandbox integration, Community Detection layoutMark Needham in Neo4j Developer BlogGenerating color palettes from movies with PythonAndris GauracsI Built a Corona Virus App to Visualize Real-World Virus DataPavel Ilin in Better ProgrammingRecursion vs Iteration: 13 Ways to Traverse a Tree.Your DevOps Guy in The StartupRestoring an MSSQL DB Running Docker Using Linux… on a MacYoureOnYaron in The StartupPython Syntax, Variables and Datatypes — Numbers, Strings, BooleansPravallika Devireddy in Learning Python programming languagePython: Beyond the basics IIm0etazAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Jumpstarting Your SEO,https://medium.com/@ateleron/jumpstarting-your-seo-9f0ed4c49b33?source=tag_archive---------45-----------------------,"SEO,Web Development,Marketing,Marketing Strategies,Search Engine Marketing","Photo by Nick Morrison on UnsplashBefore the internet was made publicly available on August 6th, 1991, much of the world’s information was shared primarily through books, journals, and newspapers sporting that classic “news-papery” feel. A lot of information was stored in libraries where it took a bit of effort to find what one was looking for.With the advent of the internet, it has become significantly easier to share information and learn. It’s been widely adopted throughout the world and became quickly a collective hub of information much in the same way libraries were in the pre-internet era — this time without the required hours to wade through halls and shelves to find what one was looking for.This paved the way for an entirely new branch of marketing called search engine optimization (SEO), through which a large part is due to the internet’s incredible potential for reaching a tremendous amount of people. With a whopping 2 trillion searches made per year [1], it’s clear that there’s quite a bit of marketing potential. SEO encompasses methods that aim to increase the chances of users searching for a website and thereby increasing its traffic. For primarily online-based business, SEO becomes integral to their survival, with many devoting significant resources in the form of creating departments, teams, or hiring consultants. Even if a business does not have as large of an online presence, spending some resources towards SEO can bring in lucrative results.There is a wide breadth of SEO-related knowledge beginning with the understanding of how websites are ranked and then moving on to designing an online presence where such knowledge is put to practical use. When developing a website, there are two stakeholders, both of which have different methods in determining how relevant a website is: users and search engines. A natural first step to accommodating the two viewpoints is to design an information architecture that’s easy for users to find what they’re looking for and easy for search engines to scan your website for information. One way to plan for this is through a sitemap.SitemapsExample sitemap template for an e-commerce website from moqups.comSearch engines use crawlers that scan your website to determine its relevancy when a user enters a search query, which, in its natural way of operating, may only scour some of its web pages. What if for some reason it doesn’t scan a highly informative page on a website, such as a product details page? This is where the sitemap can help. Creating a hierarchical, organized sitemap can make the crawler’s job easier by giving them a roadmap to how and where they collect information from a website.In the example above, the e-commerce website has three main points of entry highlighted in purple that the crawlers have access to from your home page. For example, they may not go through all of the products web pages where the meat and potatoes are and elect to only scan a few products. For an e-commerce site with a variety of products, sitemaps become essential in giving search engines a clearer picture of what a website offers.After creating a rough sketch of a sitemap, it may be time to concurrently brainstorm keywords for the website to further build its information architecture.Keyword ChoicePhoto by Ashkay on UnsplashA large part of the core of SEO consists of keywords. Keywords affect both the users’ and search engines’ ability to determine the usefulness of a website and it’s important to be meticulous when choosing the right ones to satisfy both.The most recent Google search algorithm change was announced in 2013. Code-named Hummingbird, the update placed more weight on the intent behind the search words rather than on the actual search words. This means that when the words “hardwood table” is inputted, Google will read the intent to be “buy hardwood table” and will show results from vendors that sell these items. This simplifies the process of determining keywords and lets SEO strategists focus on succinct keywords that defines the essence of the website. On the other hand, it also adds a layer of abstraction and complexity to the search engine ranking algorithm that needs to be accounted for.As with any marketing plan, it’s advised to begin as early as possible since the choices made here can have ramifications for future efforts with the project. Whiteboard sitemap drawings can provide a visual structure of a website and how each piece relates to one another. Coming up with keywords during this process can be great too. There is a saying in data science, which is not exclusive to this field, that the result is only as good as the data that goes into it. With regards to keywords, it’s integral to choose quality keywords for better ranking purposes. The topic of SEO is massive and one will come across choices that are not as clear-cut as it seems due to the black-box that encapsulates many search engine algorithms.

"Fullstack com Node.js, React e GraphQL — 9: Frontend com Material-UI e Recharts",https://medium.com/@dmatoso/fullstack-com-node-js-react-e-graphql-9-frontend-com-material-ui-e-recharts-337a2c4c4dbe?source=tag_archive---------46-----------------------,"Full Stack,Web Development,React","Fala, pessoal! Chegamos, finalmente, à nona parte da série Fullstack com Node.js, React e GraphQL! Nesta parte vamos construir o frontend da aplicação usando , Material-UI, styled-components e a biblioteca para gráficos .O que vamos construirNesta parte vamos construir uma interface simples, com apenas duas tela, mas já com uma base para evoluir.A tela inicial, Home, é um dashboard com um resumo dos nossos investimentos e um gráfico mostrando a evolução do patrimônio:A tela de Investimentos mostra uma tabela com todos os investimentos, corretoras e seus respectivos valores:E os dados?Neste primeiro momento construimos o frontend com dados estáticos. Assim fica mais fácil desenvolver e ver o resultado. No próximo passo vamos conectar com o nosso backend GraphQL para trazer os dados reais.Componente AppContinuando do capítulo anterior, onde nós fizemos o setup do frontend, vamos refatorar o componente App, que vai ser o componente raiz da aplicação.Neste componente vamos fazer uma pequena alteração no tema padrão do Material-UI para usar essa cor verde aí das imagens como cor principal e adicionar alguns providers para disponibilizar o tema para que possa ser usado nos componentes internos.// imports removidos para o exemplo ficar mais curtoconst theme = createMuiTheme({  palette: {    primary: {      main: teal[500],    },    secondary: {      main: lime[500],    },  },});const App: FC = () => {  const [navOpen, setNavOpen] = useState(false);  const toggleNav = (open: boolean) => () => {    setNavOpen(open);  };  return (    <MuiThemeProvider theme={theme}>      <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>        <StylesProvider injectFirst>          <CssBaseline />          <Router>            <MainAppBar onMenuClick={toggleNav(true)} />            <MainMenu open={navOpen} onClose={toggleNav(false)} />            <Page />          </Router>        </StylesProvider>      </ThemeProvider>    </MuiThemeProvider>  );};export default App;Com o createMuiTheme criamos um novo tema, apenas alterando as cores primária e secundária.Veja que temos dois providers onde passamos o tema: MuiThemeProvider, que é o provider do Material-UI e ThemeProvider que é o provider do styled-components. Precisamos dos dois para que as propriedades do tema estejam disponíveis tanto para os componentes do Material-UI quando para nossos componentes, estilizados com styled-components.O StylesProvider vai injetar o CSS padrão do Material-UI na página. O injectFirst faz com que ele injete antes do nosso CSS, assim podemos sobrescrever algum estilo se precisar.O CSSBaseline é uma espécie de CSS reset do Material-UI, para resetar alguns estilos padrões do navegador.Por fim temos os componentes MainAppBar, que é a barra verde no topo, o MainMenu que é o menu de navegação lateral, e o Page que é um componente que vai fazer o roteamento e exibir a página correta de acordo com o endereço. Mais detalhes desses caras abaixo.MainAppBar, MainMenu e PageO MainAppBar é um componente que usa o AppBar do Material-UI. Fizemos uma pequena customização no estilo, usando styled-components, só pra aumentar o z-index e deixá-lo por cima do menu lateral (por padrão ele fica atrás).// imports removidosconst StyledAppBar = styled(AppBar)`  ${({ theme }) => `    z-index: ${theme.zIndex.drawer + 1};  `}`;interface Props {  onMenuClick(): void;}const MainAppBar: FC<Props> = ({ onMenuClick }) => {  return (    <StyledAppBar position=""relative"">      <Toolbar>        <Hidden mdUp>          <IconButton edge=""start"" color=""inherit"" onClick={onMenuClick}>            <MenuIcon />          </IconButton>        </Hidden>        <Typography variant=""h6"">My Money</Typography>      </Toolbar>    </StyledAppBar>  );};export default MainAppBar;Veja que no nosso estilo usamos uma propriedade do tema, theme.zIndex.drawer, que guarda o z-index do menu lateral e acrescentamos + 1 pra garantir que a barra fique por cima.Outra firula é o botão de abertura do menu (um IconButton com o ícone de menu hamburger), que só aparece na versão mobile. No desktop o menu fica sempre aberto. Para fazer ele ficar escondido no desktop, usamos o componente do Material-UI, com a propriedade mdUp, que esconde o que estiver dentro dele quando a largura de tela é acima do médio, ou seja, desktop. (O Material-UI tem definido larguras padrões para desktop, tablet, celular, etc., que você pode customizar, se quiser)O MainMenu usa o do Material-UI para fazer um menu de navegação retrátil no celular. No desktop deixamos ele sempre aberto.Os links usam o componente Link do react-router pra fazer a navegação sem recarregar a página.Você pode ver o código completo do MainMenu aqui.O componente Page, por sua vez, faz apenas o roteamento para exibir os componentes HomePage ou InvestmentsPage de acordo com a URL.const StyledMain = styled('main')`  ${({ theme }) => `    ${theme.breakpoints.up('md')} {      margin-left: 256px;    }  `}`;const Page: FC = () => {  return (    <StyledMain>      <Container>        <Switch>          <Route path=""/investments"">            <InvestmentsPage />          </Route>          <Route path=""/"">            <HomePage />          </Route>        </Switch>      </Container>    </StyledMain>  );};export default Page;Veja também que adicionamos uma margem à esquerda no desktop, por causa do menu lateral.RechartsNa HomePage usamos a biblioteca para exibir um gráfico simples com a evolução do patrimônio no tempo. Ela é uma biblioteca para gráficos bem flexível, que usa por baixo dos panos e exporta tudo em componentes React.const chartData = [  { date: '2020-08-20T21:26:18.695Z', value: 100 },  { date: '2020-07-20T21:26:18.695Z', value: 110 },  { date: '2020-06-20T21:26:18.695Z', value: 130 },];<ResponsiveContainer width=""100%"" height={400}>  <LineChart data={chartData}>    <XAxis      dataKey=""date""      tickFormatter={(date) => dateFormatter.format(new Date(date))}    />    <YAxis      tickFormatter={(value) => currencyFormatter.format(value)}      width={100}    />    <CartesianGrid stroke=""#eee"" strokeDasharray=""5 5"" />    <Line type=""monotone"" dataKey=""value"" stroke=""#8884d8"" />    <Tooltip      labelFormatter={(date) => dateFormatter.format(new Date(date))}      formatter={(value, name, props) => {        return [currencyFormatter.format(value as number), 'Valor'];      }}    />  </LineChart></ResponsiveContainer>Veja que o Recharts exporta cada parte do gráfico (eixo X, eixoY, o grid, a linha e o tooltip) como um componente React. Com isso você pode montar o gráfico de forma declarativa, com as partes que precisa.Formatação de moeda e dataPara a formatação de valor monetário e de data usamos o objeto do próprio JavaScript, que possui funções de internacionalização.const currencyFormatter = new Intl.NumberFormat('pt-BR', {  style: 'currency',  currency: 'BRL',});const dateFormatter = new Intl.DateTimeFormat('pt-BR');const formattedValue = currencyFormatter.format(1000)// => R$ 1.000,00const formattedDate = dateFormatter.format(new Date());// => 11/08/2020Tanto o Intl.NumberFormat quanto o Intl.DateTimeFormat aceitam o locale ( pt-BR no nosso caso) e formatam os valores de acordo com os padrões daquele local.InvestmentsPagePor fim, a tela de investimentos é uma tabela simples, usando o componente do Material-UI.const tableData = [  { id: 1, investment: 'Tesouro Selic', broker: 'Easynvest', value: 1000 },  { id: 2, investment: 'Ações ITSA4', broker: 'Clear', value: 750 },  { id: 3, investment: 'Fundo Alaska', broker: 'BTG Pactual', value: 1200 },];<Table>  <TableHead>    <TableRow>      <TableCell>Investimento</TableCell>      <TableCell>Corretora</TableCell>      <TableCell align=""right"">Valor</TableCell>    </TableRow>  </TableHead>  <TableBody>    {tableData.map((row) => (      <TableRow key={row.id}>        <TableCell>{row.investment}</TableCell>        <TableCell>{row.broker}</TableCell>        <TableCell align=""right"">          {currencyFormatter.format(row.value)}        </TableCell>      </TableRow>    ))}  </TableBody></Table>Resultado finalO código do projeto até este ponto está em: https://github.com/doug2k1/my-money/tree/v9.0.0No próximo capítuloNa próxima parte vamos conectar nosso frontend com o backend, usando o Apollo Client.Originally published at https://www.webdevdrops.com on August 22, 2020.Written byDouglas MatosoFrontend Developer @ CI&T — Brazil.FollowFull StackWeb DevelopmentReactMore from Douglas MatosoFollowFrontend Developer @ CI&T — Brazil.More From MediumWhy you should be using React FragmentsAaron S in JavaScript In Plain EnglishDonald Trump Won, No Matter What Happens NextJessica Wildfire in The Apeiron BlogThe Election Should Never Have Been This Closeumair haque in Eudaimonia and Co20 Things Most People Learn Too Late In LifeNicolas Cole in Better Advice(Why) There Was no Biden Landslideumair haque in Eudaimonia and CoThis Is ‘I Wish a Motherf*cker Would’ Week for Black PeopleMarley K. in ZORAMy daughter was a creative genius, then we bought her an iPhoneStephanie Gruner Buckley in Modern ParentI Worked the Polls in Trump Country — and Left More Confused Than EverAaron Gell in GENAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

Number Guesser | Understanding JS and DOM Better,https://medium.com/@sakshijjain1997/number-guesser-understanding-js-and-dom-better-fe55b4a936cb?source=tag_archive---------49-----------------------,"JavaScript,Javascript Development,Javascript Tips,Web Development,Web","With a lot of DOM projects , we can learn and skill DOM and JS Better with the full implementation of such small fun projects.To continue with this, let us start one another project : Number Guesser , where we will input some kind of number , given 3 attempts/guesses to us to answer the correct number .These JS projects do not focus much on UI, because that is what you can give tons of time to beautify, what more important is a working functionality of it.So lets start, open your favorite VS Code and name folder : Number Guesser with an index.html and app.js file.Lets check UI of that :This is indeed a very simple UI , with a boiler plate of HTML and CDN paths of Bootstrap and Skeleton CSS. The DOM structure is itself very simple.<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=”en”><head><meta charset=”UTF-8""><meta name=”viewport” content=”width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0""><link rel=”stylesheet” href=”https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css"" integrity=”sha384-ggOyR0iXCbMQv3Xipma34MD+dH/1fQ784/j6cY/iJTQUOhcWr7x9JvoRxT2MZw1T” crossorigin=”anonymous”><link rel=”stylesheet” href=”https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/skeleton/2.0.4/skeleton.min.css""><title>Number Guesser </title></head><body><div class=”container”><h1>Number Guesser</h1><div id=”game”><p>Guess the Number between <span class=”min-num”></span> and <span class=”max-num”> </span></p><input type=”number” id=”guess-input” placeholder=”Enter your guess…”><input type=”submit” value=”submit” id=”guess-btn”><p class=”message”></p></div><div id=”info”><a href=”https://www.google.com/"" target=”_blank”> <h3 class=”btn btn-danger”>Understand the Code!</h3> </a></div></div><script src=”app.js”></script></body></html>I hope , seeing the UI , you can easily work on its HTML code . Lets jump straight into app.js file.First Checkout the rules of games:/*GAME FUNCTION:- Player must guess a number between a min and max- Player gets a certain amount of guesses- Notify player of guesses remaining- Notify the player of the correct answer if loose- Let player choose to play again*/Game must have some initializing values:2. As I always say, grab your UI elements accordingly.message is to report either you got correct or wrong answer.3. Now we need to assign our const minNum and maxNum their minimum and maximum values to avoid rigidness in UI , so that you can change your min and max values in between any range.Now we need to add particular event listeners while clicking on submit button:So first we parse our input value into an integer and the will check if guess is not NaN and less than min and greater than max. Once all this is checked , we will enter into some conditions , if guessed no is equal to winning number .. then game is won else your guesses will be reduced by 1 and once it got 0 , the game will be over else display the error message of no of guesses are left..Once the guessesLeft===0 , we call gameOver() function:Once the gameOver () is called , we give the feature of play again and add the Btn value and classname equal to Play Again.So whenever the btn value changes to Play Again after the gameOver() function called, we call an eventlistener to it to reload the window again.The winning number will be generated randomly using function:So this is how , a fun game is created interactively and dynamically.Written bysakshi jainBecause heart screams louder than mind and we don’t listen!FollowJavaScriptJavascript DevelopmentJavascript TipsWeb DevelopmentWebMore from sakshi jainFollowBecause heart screams louder than mind and we don’t listen!More From MediumUnderstanding the JavaScript Spread Operator — From beginner to expertEstefanía García Gallardo in Better ProgrammingHow to Use .reduce() in JavaScriptAlex Pickering in Better ProgrammingDo you know why this.x is Undefined when x is declared with Const or Let?Moon in JavaScript In Plain EnglishYour Code Should Tell a StoryMadhavan Nagarajan in Better ProgrammingAutomating Your Front-End Application Testing With  SeleniumOyetoke Tobi EmmanuelHow To Import SVGs into NextJSMalcolm Laing in Frontend DigestCRUD With a Desktop Electron AppPavel Ilin in Better ProgrammingEnd to end testing an e-commerce platform with Nightwatch.js and BrowserstackChantal Steur in De Bijenkorf TechblogAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
What is a dedicated server what is it functions and what is it use for ? — Bookeers.com,https://medium.com/@bookeers.com/what-is-a-dedicated-server-what-is-it-functions-and-what-is-it-use-for-bookeers-com-8ba7eecfa771?source=tag_archive---------50-----------------------,"Dedicated Server,Hosting,Web,Web Development,Website","What is a dedicated server what is it functions and what is it use for ?What is a dedicated server what is it functions and what is it use for ?As the name already suggests, a dedicated server is nothing more than a server, or machine, entirely dedicated to a user and located on a Server Farm (or Webfarm ), managed by providers that, in principle, deal exclusively with hardware interventions on request from the same customers.Once you have clarified what a dedicated server is, you can move on to illustrating its main features so that you already have an idea of ​​its functionality . A dedicated server consists of a CPU , Central Processing Unit , or central unit, of a RAM , Random Access Memory , and of a disk space , characteristics to which the providers that provide hosting plans associate a Web service . (Linux or Windows) with relevant software and a permanent Internet connection. Those listed are general attributes which, of course, they vary according to the providers and the chosen plan.Before proceeding with the list of the other characteristics of a dedicated server, it is good to clarify an important point, so as not to “demotivate” all those who are thinking of purchasing this type of service but are aware of not having the technical skills. for its management.Within the group of dedicated servers it is in fact possible to draw a further distinction between the so-called dedicated unmaneged server and the dedicated server maneged . In the first case it is the customer who buys the service to deal with all the problems that may occur on the server itself while the providers only intervene in the case of problems related to hardware and connectivity. It follows that this type of dedicated server is recommended for those who have technical skills and resources to manage the machine.In the second case, however, the providers also guarantee the customer the assistance of a technical staff who essentially takes care of the management of the server, intervening, therefore, whenever problems occur, be they security or updating, raising the customer from this burden. It is evident that dedicated managed servers ensure a much more complete service both at hardware and software level and for this reason they have higher costs than unmaneged dedicated servers . Having clarified this point, it is possible to identify the other technical characteristics that must necessarily be verified when choosing and purchasing a dedicated server..What is a dedicated server? The technical aspectsRegardless of what your skills are, there are a series of purely technical features that it is essential to evaluate carefully before selecting this or that offer.As for memory (RAM) , the criterion to follow is: the more RAM available the faster the access speed to the site , so make sure there is enough.Equally crucial is the disk space that needs to be modulated based on your site’s data consumption . In addition, if you need a good loading speed, dedicated servers with SSD disks , Solid State Drive , capable of guaranteeing significantly reduced loading times, are preferable .Another key point is the band , responsible for the amount of data that can be sent in a specific period of time. To optimally select your bandwidth requirement, it is important to take into account not only the number of average visitors but also the type , size and quality of the content on the site; so, for example, a site with a lot of high resolution photographic material will need a higher bandwidth than a portal with few low resolution photos.Fundamental to understand what a dedicated server is is also to evaluate the speed of connection to the server , therefore connectivity , and the security and backup options , which are priority to protect and save all the information present on your site.The software must be chosen taking into account the operating system . There are two options, Windows , ideal for ASP.NET and MS SQL sites , and Linux perfect for all portals designed to use an open source system such as MySQL or Apache .Last important aspect to evaluate is the assistance service which must be professional and reliable so as to be able to support the customer in the event of faults and anomalies . It is good to remember that the characteristics of the assistance service vary according to the type of dedicated server ; if you have opted for the purchase of the server , the support will be limited exclusively to problems related to the infrastructure and the network while in the hypothesis of the rent , the service provider will also deal with any hardware and systemic problems .How a dedicated Server works: the advantagesFrom what has been said so far, it is clear that dedicated servers offer numerous advantages and therefore it is a highly professional hosting solution .The first characteristic of a dedicated server is undoubtedly the flexibility that allows each customer to install on the server all the software and services that their site needs. In fact, a dedicated server, unlike the shared one, allows the user / customer to operate on the server side and manage it in complete autonomy without having to run into limits and restrictions.At this point, the performance of the server itself inevitably also binds, which will be much better given the possibility of being able to use all the resources of the dedicated server exclusively with significant advantages in terms of stability and connection speed.The exclusive use of the server also reflects on the reliability of the service which protects the customer from anomalies, blockages, slowdowns or “downs of the site” caused by other users, situations that can instead occur in the case of shared servers .Exclusive access to the server also means greater security and therefore protection of your data that will not be accessible to other users, not to mention that a dedicated server allows you to create customized firewalls and independently install any security update. A complete autonomy, therefore, which clearly not only affects the security side but is also related to all other server configurations , such as software, firewalls, control panels , which can be customized to your liking.If we ask ourselves what a dedicated server is, we must also understand that this variant among the various servers provides one or more dedicated IP addresses , a feature that protects against potentially dangerous situations, such as spam or bad SEO positioning , hypotheses possible in the case of shared IPs.The strengths of a dedicated server are therefore numerous and could be summarized with the words flexibility, complete control, stability and greater security .A negative aspect could, however, be represented by the price which, clearly, is higher than that of shared servers and varies according to the type of service ( unmaneged or managed ) and the chosen plan.Those who decide to opt for the hardware purchase , in fact, must be aware that the costs will initially be higher and that a good initial budget is therefore necessary while the monthly fee for the housing service will be more contained by virtue of the characteristics previously exposed. In the case of rent , however, the monthly fee will certainly be more substantial as the customer is relieved of the burden of having to deal with all the tasks related to hardware management and any malfunctions.Surfing the net it is possible to find many offers of dedicated servers of as many numerous providers with webfarm both in Italy and abroad. The prices vary greatly from provider to provider and change, of course, also according to the characteristics of the selected service . So there are suppliers that offer dedicated “ basic “ servers starting from prices that vary on average from 20 to 70 euros per month , while “standard” offers can have a cost that on average is around 100/200 euros per month. The advanced and business-type offers obviously have higher rates that on average range between 200 and 300 euros per month. Those proposed are only indicative prices that obviously can vary a lot depending on the provider and the chosen plan.What is a dedicated server and how it works: who needs itFor those who, instead, use a shared server service, there may come a moment in the history of their site that must encourage reflection on the possibility of opting for the dedicated server solution . So when is it time to upgrade?In principle it is not possible to establish times as each site has its own history and evolution. However, there are important signs to evaluate, thanks to which it is possible to understand when to switch to a more professional service . The cases are numerous and range from the increase in the number of daily visits to the slowing down of the loading of pages, from on-going technical needs, relating to applications, to a greater need for the user to control and manage.What is a dedicated server: classificationAs seen, there are many Business hosting packages among which you have to orient yourself taking into account your needs. In general, the following sub-groups of dedicated servers can be identified:Dedicated unmanaged servers : The customer takes care of the server management first hand , so this solution is recommended for those with excellent server-side management skills . The assistance from the provider is reduced to the essentials but the monthly costs are more containedDedicated managed servers : The customer has access to the server and to some specific information such as user and data control, but it is the provider that takes care of its management and changes . The fact of being able to count on a much more complex and complete assistance obviously also leads to an increase in costs.Dedicated self-managed servers : The customer manages his own server while the provider limits himself to providing a basic support service, generally at a lower price.Semi-managed dedicated servers : The customer manages the server firsthand but the hosting company offers a medium level support service whose specifications vary from provider to provider.Fully managed managed servers : In this case, the provider takes care of the entire management of the site , from security configurations to updates.Originally published at https://bookeers.com.Written byBookeers.com Cheap Domain and Secure HostingIf you want to get your business online and start up and running then we have the best deals for you check out https://bookeers.comFollowDedicated ServerHostingWebWeb DevelopmentWebsiteMore from Bookeers.com Cheap Domain and Secure HostingFollowIf you want to get your business online and start up and running then we have the best deals for you check out https://bookeers.comMore From MediumPython Database Connection with sqlalchemyIbrahim Olawale in The StartupHow to Create a Python Wrapper for C/C++ Shared LibrariesNg Wai Foong in Better ProgrammingWhat is Full-Stack?PS BYTESCreate a carousel (slideshow) without JavascriptAndreas Ströberg in The StartupFast Docker build in KubernetesLiejun Tao in The StartupAlgorithm practice: The matrix unrollJohn Fajardo in The StartupThe Sims 4 Modern Python Modding: DebuggingJune Hanabi in Analytics VidhyaHow to set up Docker and Windows Subsystem for Linux: A Love Story. 💚Piotr Gaczkowski in freeCodeCamp.orgAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

Before we get to the instructional material, let’s refresh ourselves on exactly what we are talking about, especially in terms of JavaScript coding using React.What is JavaScript?JavaScript is a coding language imbedded in hypertext markup language (HTML) documents to make a webpage more dynamic and user-friendly. That is a good definition to tell you that the JavaScript allows visitors to webpages to perform fun activities like pressing buttons and entering things like their emails and addresses. When you visit your favorite social media or retail webpage, you have the option to navigate around a bit and buy things. JavaScript is the language that makes those functions possible; otherwise, you would navigate to a webpage and just see static content and that is no fun. React is just one of the many JavaScript (JS) libraries employed to allow you to interact with the webpage. Now, let’s find a book to explain all of this in a deeper fashion.Top 5 Books to Learn React.js in 2020Without wasting any more of your time, here is my list of best books to learn React.js in 2020.

Creating a sitemap generator for Next.js,https://medium.com/spemer/creating-a-sitemap-generator-for-next-js-3102fb5a297e?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Nextjs,SEO,Web Development,Front End Development,Development","In this story, I’d like to share the search engine optimization — that was done while converting the Volla bridge page which was written in Vue.js into Next.js — and how I created a dynamic sitemap generator for Next.js.1. Create sitemap generator script following Next.js folder structureNext.js automatically creates URL following folder and file name in the pages directory. So, I’m going to write the XML generating script, that exclude the special file names of Next.js (_document.js, _app.js etc.) among all the folder and file names in the pages directory using globby.globbyUser-friendly glob matching Based on but adds a bunch of useful features. $ npm install globby ├── unicorn ├── cake └──…www.npmjs.comFirst, create a scripts folder in the root directory, and write the following code named sitemap-common.js.Executing the above script creates xml file as below(example).2. Writing sitemap generator script for external APIAs in the example code above, it’s relatively easy to create sitemaps for static pages. However, for dynamic pages(e.g. pages with userId), we need to write a script that creates a sitemap in a slightly different way (in the example code, I used JSONPlaceholder’s API).JSONPlaceholderJSONPlaceholder is a free online REST API that you can use whenever you need some fake data. It's great for tutorials…jsonplaceholder.typicode.comI wrote the following code — named sitemap-posts.js.Executing the above script creates xml file as below(example).3. Writing script that compresses all sitemap files created above into gzip formatSitemaps that compressed in gzip(.gz) format can be used in the same way as xml format sitemaps, but in a smaller size. Using zlib, I’m going to compress all the xml files created above into a gzip format.The above script compresses all the xml files created in steps 1 and 2 into .gz format.Node.js v14.9.0 DocumentationThe zlib module provides compression functionality implemented using Gzip, Deflate/Inflate, and Brotli.

To submitting a sitemap to Google Search Console, etc., a single sitemap must be submitted, so I wrote the following script to create a sitemap index file.Executing the above script creates xml file as below(example).5. Writing a bash script that creates a new sitemap for each master deployments, and a script that pings the sitemap to Google Search Console from GitHub Actions# yarn sitemap$ cd public$ rm -rf sitemap$ mkdir sitemap$ cd ..$ cd scripts$ node ./sitemap-common.js$ node ./sitemap-posts.js$ node ./sitemap.jsIf you want to make Google Search Console reindex your pages, just add one line below at the end of the script.$ curl http://google.com/ping?sitemap=http://website.com/sitemap.xmlI wrote a new bash script like below to create sitemaps in xml format, compress those sitemaps into gzip format, and remove unused xml files automatically.Afterwards, I modified the workflow file to run the above scripts in GitHub Actions on master deployment.# Create a sitemap and submit it to Google.- run: yarn sitemap  name: ping sitemapFeatures * GitHub ActionsYou can't perform that action at this time.

Node.js Best Practices — Express App Reliability and Logging,https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/node-js-best-practices-express-app-reliability-and-logging-34be102aab9b?source=tag_archive---------2-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Radek Grzybowski on UnsplashLike any kind of apps, JavaScript apps also have to be written well.Otherwise, we run into all kinds of issues later on.In this article, we’ll look at some best practices we should follow when writing Node apps.Structure Express ApplicationsWe should have the following folder structure for our Express app:src/  config/  controllers/  providers/  services/  models/  routes.js  db.js  app.jstest/  unit/  integration/server.js(cluster.js)test.jsWe have the src folder with the code that runs in production.config has config.controllers have the controllers.providers have the logic for the controller routes.services have the business logic.models have the database models.routes.js loads all routes.db.js has the database routes.app.js loads the Express app.test has the tests.unit has the unit tests.integration has the integration tests.server.js in the entry point of the Express app.cluster.js is an optional file for creating clusters.test.js is the main test file to run all the tests in the test directory.Improve Express.js Performance and ReliabilityThere are a few ways to improve performance and reliability.Set NODE_ENV to productionWe should set the NODE_ENV environment variable to production so we get the benefits of the production config.It’s 3 times than in dev.This is because there’s compression and caching to make our app faster.We can either run:export NODE_ENV=productionto set the environment variableor:NODE_ENV=production node server.jsto set the environment variable and run the app at the same time.Enable Gzip CompressionWe can enable gzip compression for assets to do compression on our assets.We can install the compression middleware by running:npm i compressionThen we can use it by writing:const compression = require('compression')const express = require('express')const app = express()app.use(compression())This isn’t the best way to do gzip compression since it uses resources on the Express app.Instead, we can enable gzip in the Nginx instead to offload the work to the reverse proxy.Always Use Asynchronous FunctionsIf we have anything other than some simple operations, we should probably use async code.We should promises most of the time or async/await for short.For example, we can write:(async () => {  const foo = () => {    //...    return val  }​  const val = await asyncFunction;})()We have an asyncFunction that returns a promise, so we use await to get the result.We can’t run synchronous functions on different threads since Node is single-threaded.Therefore, we can only use async code to run long-running operations.We can also spawn child processes or create multiple instances of our app to run different tasks on different processes.Logging CorrectlyWe should collect our logs in a central location.This way, we can find them when we need them.Winston and Morgan and useful logging packages that can integrate with other services for centralized logging.We can also use some service like Sematext to do logging.For example, we can write:const { stLogger, stHttpLoggerMiddleware } = require('sematext-agent-express')​const express = require('express')const app = express()app.use(stHttpLoggerMiddleware)​app.get('/api', (req, res, next) => {  stLogger.info('An info.')  stLogger.debug('A debug.')  stLogger.warn('A warning.')  stLogger.error('An error.')  res.send('Hello World.')})We have the the sematext-agent-express package which has a logger than logs to the Sematext service.Then we get the logs in a nice dashboard with the service.Photo by 🇨🇭 Claudio Schwarz | @purzlbaum on UnsplashConclusionWe can better structure our Express app and run our production Express app in production mode.Also, logging can be easy with a centralized logging service.JavaScript In Plain EnglishDid you know that we have three publications and a YouTube channel?

A Look Back at My Unusual Journey to Becoming a Web Developer,https://medium.com/better-programming/a-look-back-at-my-unusual-journey-to-becoming-a-female-web-developer-jamie-pittman-676cf13eb6eb?source=tag_archive---------4-----------------------,"Women In Tech,Career Change,Web Development,Coding,Codingbootcamp","Photo by Christina @ wocintechchat.com on UnsplashAt the time of this post, I am a 36-years-young female web developer. Before I discuss my coding career, I want to tell you about my career history and how I found myself working as a web developer. I hope that my story will inspire other women of all ages to pursue what interests you and take a chance on yourself.This web developer does not have a degree in Computer Science.I do have two degrees: a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Exercise and Sports Studies with a minor in Business, and a Master of Education in Health Education (MAEd). Neither degree is related to programming in any way.I do have a certificate from a coding bootcamp that I attended through the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill and Trilogy Education. I completed a full-stack development course in May 2017 and immediately started my web development career.This web developer did A LOT of other jobs before landing in her current role.I have been really fortunate to have been able to experience a variety of different jobs in my 15 years in the workforce. My first job was as a public high school teacher. I taught 9th-grade health and physical education — it was the most rewarding and most difficult job I ever had. In addition to teaching, I also coached cheerleading and softball.After two years of teaching, I moved on to working for a non-profit coordinating programs for health and physical education teachers.In January 2010, I took a role coordinating and teaching a weight management program for state employees and teachers in North Carolina (Eat Smart, Move More, Weight Less). During this job is where my interest in web development began.We were a small team, and each of us was open to doing things that weren’t necessarily in our job description. We outsourced the creation of our program’s website and then I was able to maintain it from that point on. It was created in WordPress and I loved going in and looking at what was going on under the hood. However, I didn’t really think much of it in terms of building a new skill or even as something that could turn into a future career.In 2012 I took a job as a wellness coordinator that would relocate me to Houston, Texas. While I was there I picked up other skills and knowledge: health insurance, retirement programs, and general human resources skills. I worked as a liaison with our internal IT partners on logic for file feeds which allowed me to see more of the logic side of coding.While still living in Houston, I joined the local chapter of Girl Develop It in January 2015. I learned HTML and CSS, and I absolutely loved it! However, I still didn’t see this as a gateway to a new career. It was fun, but I wasn’t really sure where to go next.I decided to move back to North Carolina in September 2015 and took a job as an account manager for a worksite wellness company. Upon returning, I continued to piddle with HTML and CSS, using the knowledge I’d gained in the years prior. I still did not see these skills as being something I could translate into a full-time job. Five years ago, the prevalence of boot camps are nothing like they are today!This web developer decided to take a risk…and it paid off.In the summer of 2016, I came across an ad for a local coding bootcamp. I started reading more about it and asking the few people I knew who were web developers — mainly my brother’s friends.When I was trying to decide if this was a career that I could be successful in, I asked my brother’s friends what they thought. What do I need to do or be able to do to be successful?Their response: know how to use Google.Now I know that truer words have never been spoken! But I was still nervous. I was scared out of my mind of failing. But then I started thinking: What is the worst thing that could happen?I can’t find a job as a web developerI’m horrible at my job as a web developerI get fired from eventual web developer job because I’m horrible at itThe worst things that could happen as a result of attending a coding boot camp:If those were truly the worst things that could happen, my plan would be the same for all scenarios: go back to the type of work I was doing before the boot camp. Wow. That’s not so scary. I mean it would suck if I had to do that, but I COULD DO IT.So, off I went! I enrolled in the second cohort ever of UNC-Chapel Hill’s Coding Boot Camp that started in November 2016. At the time, there were only two coding boot camps in the area. The one I chose was part-time and catered to working adults. I wanted to continue to work and save as much money as possible. The other boot camp operated from 9am-5pm during the workweek, so I would have had to quit my job. I wasn’t interested in that, personally.In March 2017 I got an opportunity to take an internship at a local startup and I jumped at it. It was a massive pay cut ($75k a year salary to $20/hour massive), BUT I felt like it was the right thing to do. I wanted to get my foot in the door and learn. So, I did.After a few months at the internship, I got an opportunity to work for another startup in a junior developer program. Fortunately, I got the job and it was the start of my career as a web developer.My First Year as a Web DeveloperThe most challenging and equally fulfilling year of my web development career was my first year. I am so thankful for that opportunity and experience. I am really grateful that I was in a program with three other junior developers. To this day, I am still really good friends with most of them (shout out to Katie and Shane). I think having that shared experience was critical to our success.As part of our program, we were to build a product and present our weekly progress every Friday to our Chief Technical Officer (CTO). Gulp. No pressure. Looking back, I am glad that we had to do those weekly presentations. I don’t think I have ever been as nervous in a job as I was for those first several Friday presentations.On top of our nerve-wracking Friday presentations, I had no experience with frameworks, and they used AngularJS. This meant every night after work and on weekends, I was learning AngularJS. My teammates were doing the same thing, spending free moments trying to catch up as best we could.After about two months with the four of us working together in a small team, we were going to be assigned out to existing teams with more experienced developers. Gulp. Katie and I were assigned to the frontend team to work on the redesign of our company’s existing app. We were both excited but scared to death.My main fear was around using Git, if I’m being totally honest. Even to this day I still get really nervous when using Git with a new team. I just didn’t want to mess anything up. But, that is the purpose of Git — to keep you from messing things up.Another thing that was different was the code review process. Again, I am thankful for the experience that I got with this here as I have moved through my career. I found that code reviews were where I learned the most. I would get feedback from other developers on how to improve my code, and I could see how they were sorting through problems.The junior developer group continued to help each other out, but we also weren’t afraid to ask our more experienced colleagues for help as needed. They were critical to our continued learning and success. We learned something new every day and worked really hard.All good things must come to an end, and in April 2019 I decided to move on to a larger organization. There was a lot that went into my decision that I won’t get into here, but I needed to move on.I worked at Fidelity Investments on the User Experience and Design Team (aka UXD) for about a year. I absolutely loved my team (shoutout to Team Serena), but I wanted to focus more on JavaScript. At this role, my main focus was on building prototypes for production teams, and I wasn’t learning much on the job. They used Angular 6, which gave me the opportunity to learn a new framework, but no one was reviewing my code and I wasn’t learning from my peers. As much as I loved my team, I was too early in my career to be regressing in my development skills.I moved on to a new job after a year, where I joined a frontend team using React, TypeScript, and Redux. I was really hopeful about this job and opportunities for learning, but unfortunately, I found out pretty quickly that this job was not going to be a good fit for me.I did learn a lot about Git and TypeScript while I was there, and I had two really awesome teammates (shoutout to Don and Stephen). However, I just wasn’t building anything or getting to use JavaScript like I’d hoped. In the six months I was there I worked on analytics, Cypress testing, and assigning CSS variables.Additionally, I was the only female web developer in the organization and the most junior by many, many years. I felt really isolated and had no one to relate to whatsoever. My teammates were incredibly supportive, but it’s not the same as having another developer with similar experience to have your back.On August 31, I will start a new job that I am very excited about. I am hopeful that I will be here for many years to come.Takeaways from my experiences as a web developer so farTake a chance on yourself.I had started learning how to code before I enrolled in a boot camp, so I knew that it was something I was capable of doing. I highly recommend taking risks in your career, but make informed decisions. Do your homework.When you’re first starting out, find a tribe of like-minded people for support.The junior developer program I was part of was critical to my learning and success. Even just having another developer to work with that has similar experiences makes a huge difference.If you don’t like your job, don’t stay.I am not super proud that I only stayed at my last job for 6 months, but I was pretty miserable. Life is too short to be miserable! Certainly give it a chance, but don’t feel like you need to stay longer than six months if it’s not serving you.In reading about my experiences as a web developer, I hope you were able to take away a few key things.Let me know what you think!

Learning the great “Gatsby JS” — a tutorial for beginners — Part I,https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/learning-the-great-gatsby-js-a-tutorial-for-beginners-part-i-1735307c7bc7?source=tag_archive---------5-----------------------,"Gatsbyjs,JavaScript,React,Web Development,Technology","So, here we are. Before we get started, I know it’s been a while since I sat down and wrote something meaningful, but yeah, here we are anyways.All this time, I’ve been exploring various different frameworks, libraries both in JavaScript and Python. I’ve watched tons of video tutorials and made a bunch of projects by myself too. I had just started learning React, the amazing library everyone’s talking about. Anyways, I stumbled across various other frameworks and libraries that were based off React primarily. And somehow I went to the docs of this purply official site of Gatsby.js and I did something very new. Instead of jumping into video tutorials like I always do, I gave a shot at the beginner-tutorial-docs that they offered and I jumped right at it.Before, we get any further, I’m assuming you are familiar with React, even if you aren’t hang on, Gatsby.js is very familiar to React, you might pick a thing or two along the way about React too 😄The landing page at https://www.gatsbyjs.com/So, why Gatsby.js ? What is so unique about this React-based framework? A simple google search would spin off something like this:Gatsby is a React-based, GraphQL powered, static site generator.What is a static site?Since the dawn of the modern web, performance has been a key consideration when designing a website or a web app. When a website requires no server interaction whatsoever, what is hosted on the web is served to a user as is, this is referred to as a static site.Or simply, It can be a site which contains fixed content. Several use cases including event listings, portfolio pages and blogs & many more.Why a static site?Why’d you wanna prefer a static site anyways ? In case of dynamic websites (requiring client-server interaction) because of challenges including slow load-time, security flaws, and hosting costs amongst others. The absence of a server mitigates these risks. Static Site Generators are tools used develop static sites, effectively and efficiently.And finally how does GatsbyJs work ?What separates Gatsby.js from the others is the way it handles data. In Gatsby.js, as we are not concerned about the server, data could come from several types of files in the project — markdown, CSV, JSON, or it could come from external services like NetlifyCMS, Medium, or even CMS like Drupal and Wordpress. And to make this possible Gatsby.js has a very cool plugin architecture, which would really come in handy as we go along.source: https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsbyOh, but what about GraphQL ?When you are building sites with Gatsby, you can access your data using this query language called “GraphQL” GraphQL allows you to declaratively express your data needs. This is done with queries, queries are the representation of the data you need. A query looks like this:Which will return,Notice how the query signature exactly matches the returned JSON signature. This is possible because in GraphQL, you query against a schema that is the representation of your available data. Don’t worry about where the schema comes from right now, Gatsby takes care of organizing all of your data for you and making it discoverable with a tool called GraphiQL. GraphiQL is a UI that lets you 1) run queries against your data in the browser, and 2) dig into the structure of data available to you through a data type explorer.Now, we’re all set! Let’s dive in !!!Prerequisites & Environment Set upKnowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is required with a focus on ES6 Syntax and JavaScript Classes.Basic knowledge of React and GraphQL is also of advantage.Check if the following things are installed,NodeGitTo make Gatsby sites easily, let’s install the Gatsby CLInpm install -g gatsby-cliAlright, we’re all set now!Creating our first Gatsby Site!Open up an editor of your choice and fire up the terminal. We’ll use the starter template that is provided to us through the CLI.Getting started :Type the following command into the terminalgatsby new hello-world https://www.github.com/gatsby/gatsby-starter-hello-worldNote: hello-world is an arbitary name, it’s basically your name, you are free to choose the title of your choice.This is will bring up a bunch of folders and files into your directory.Note: the .prettierignore, .prettierrc are present here because I have an extension called Prettier installed in my VSCode, to make my js files look “prettier”If you are familiar with React, you’ll find the similarites in the structure of the project. And the fact that we usually only work with the src folder.2. Change into this directorycd hello-world3. Starting the developer servergatsby developThis command would start the local development server in our machine. You’ll be able to see and interact with your new site here, just you do with React app.Your terminal would look something like thisAs suggested, let’s check out https://localhost:8000/Wondering how “Hello world!” is being displayed ? This is because of the index.js file that lies in the pages folder of src directory of your project hello-world. To make this visible, try changing the index.js file and see for yourself.hello-world>src>pages>index.jsAnd there it is! 👯 Your very first Gatsby site, up and running in your local host.Next, we’ll look into detail how to customise our pages.Using page components:Previously we saw that the index.js was resided inside the pages folder. Any react component that is present inside src/pages/*.js will become a page!Let’s create a new page, by adding a new file src/pages/about.js !Now navigate to https://localhost:8000/aboutI know, it’s that simple yet very efficient.Well, you could ask me, all this is cool but what about styling ?Styling in Gatsby:To add your css files in Gatsby all you gotta do is,Create the css file in a folder, if you want to, it’s totally upto you.To make this css work it’s magic, you gotta do a bit more, for Gatsby to know this css file exists you gotta create a new file gatsby-browser.js in the root of the project. And then add the following code:Now, restart the development server and go to the local host!Yass, there are many other ways to style like CSS modules, CSS-in-JS etc., you can try them all :DPlugins in Gatsby :A plugin simply adds or modifies a functionality in a very simple and straight forward way. There are hundred of plugins made for Gatsby that are available on their site and are maintained by the community members. And you make one too.For this section, Let’s install and implement a Gatsby plugin for Typography.js.Create a new site:gatsby new plugins-and-data https:/github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-worldthen cd into itcd plugins-and-data2. Now, let’s install the plugin, for this I’d like to use the “Kirkham” themed, typography and nice CSS-in-JS, “Emotion”.npm install --save gatsby-plugin-typography typography react-typography typography-theme-kirkham gatsby-plugin-emotion @emotion/coreTo let Gatsby know about this plugin, we shall mess with the gatsby-configure.js that’s present in the root of this project. Add the following lines.Next, the typography.js needs a configuration file, we shall create a folder called “utils” in src and add a “typography.js” there. Then, add the following into that file.For this second site, let’s have a nice Layout component that can be used by all other pages. Create a folder “components” inside src and create a layout.js file. We’ll be using “Emotion” here. Add the following lines there.To link various pages, we use Link from the core of Gatsby.Then, the about.js,Next, the index.js,Now, let’s start the development server as usual using gatsby developAnd open up the local host at 8000 port!!Yass, there you go! Your first ever proper Gatsby site that uses a Plugin !!!!! 😍If you’ve come this far, give yourself a pat on the back! You’ve learned something new today.And that’s it for this post ! Next, we’ll check out how to use GraphQL to get our data!! And how to render markdown files as if they are HTML using a new plugin, should be exciting!!!

Material UI — Expansion Panels,https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/material-ui-expansion-panels-e6f8de7753ef?source=tag_archive---------6-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Rachel Park on UnsplashMaterial UI is a Material Design library made for React.It’s a set of React components that have Material Design styles.In this article, we’ll look at how to add expansion panels with Material UI.Expansion PanelExpansion panels let us add boxes that can be expanded and collapsed.To add a simple one, we can write:import React from ""react"";import ExpansionPanel from ""@material-ui/core/ExpansionPanel"";import ExpansionPanelSummary from ""@material-ui/core/ExpansionPanelSummary"";import ExpansionPanelDetails from ""@material-ui/core/ExpansionPanelDetails"";import Typography from ""@material-ui/core/Typography"";import ExpandMoreIcon from ""@material-ui/icons/ExpandMore"";export default function App() {  return (    <>      <ExpansionPanel>        <ExpansionPanelSummary          expandIcon={<ExpandMoreIcon />}          id=""panel1-header""        >          <Typography>Expansion Panel 1</Typography>        </ExpansionPanelSummary>        <ExpansionPanelDetails>          <Typography>            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.          </Typography>        </ExpansionPanelDetails>      </ExpansionPanel>      <ExpansionPanel>        <ExpansionPanelSummary          expandIcon={<ExpandMoreIcon />}          id=""panel2-header""        >          <Typography>Expansion Panel 2</Typography>        </ExpansionPanelSummary>        <ExpansionPanelDetails>          <Typography>Sit amet blandit leo lobortis eget.</Typography>        </ExpansionPanelDetails>      </ExpansionPanel>    </>  );}to add 2 expansion panels with the ExpansionPanel s.The expandIcon prop holds the icon that’s displayed for letting us expand the panel.ExpansionPanelDetails has the content of the expansion panel.ExpansionPanelSummary has the content of the heading.Controlled AccordionWe can make it a controlled component buy passing in the expanded and onChange props to the ExpansionPanel .For example, we can write:import React from ""react"";import ExpansionPanel from ""@material-ui/core/ExpansionPanel"";import ExpansionPanelSummary from ""@material-ui/core/ExpansionPanelSummary"";import ExpansionPanelDetails from ""@material-ui/core/ExpansionPanelDetails"";import Typography from ""@material-ui/core/Typography"";import ExpandMoreIcon from ""@material-ui/icons/ExpandMore"";export default function App() {  const [expanded, setExpanded] = React.useState(false);const handleChange = panel => (event, isExpanded) => {    setExpanded(isExpanded ? panel : false);  };return (    <>      <ExpansionPanel        expanded={expanded === ""panel1""}        onChange={handleChange(""panel1"")}      >        <ExpansionPanelSummary          expandIcon={<ExpandMoreIcon />}          id=""panel1-header""        >          <Typography>Expansion Panel 1</Typography>        </ExpansionPanelSummary>        <ExpansionPanelDetails>          <Typography>            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.          </Typography>        </ExpansionPanelDetails>      </ExpansionPanel>      <ExpansionPanel        expanded={expanded === ""panel2""}        onChange={handleChange(""panel2"")}      >        <ExpansionPanelSummary          expandIcon={<ExpandMoreIcon />}          id=""panel2-header""        >          <Typography>Expansion Panel 2</Typography>        </ExpansionPanelSummary>        <ExpansionPanelDetails>          <Typography>Sit amet blandit leo lobortis eget.</Typography>        </ExpansionPanelDetails>      </ExpansionPanel>    </>  );}to make the expansion panels work together as an accordion.We have the expanded prop that sets whether the expansion panel should be expanded.onChange is a function that lets us set the panel to be expanded.We set the panel name with the panel parameter of the handleChange function.Customized Expansion PanelsWe can change the styles of the expansion panel components with the withStyles higher order component.For instance, we can write:import React from ""react"";import { withStyles } from ""@material-ui/core/styles"";import MuiExpansionPanel from ""@material-ui/core/ExpansionPanel"";import MuiExpansionPanelSummary from ""@material-ui/core/ExpansionPanelSummary"";import MuiExpansionPanelDetails from ""@material-ui/core/ExpansionPanelDetails"";import Typography from ""@material-ui/core/Typography"";const ExpansionPanel = withStyles({  root: {    color: ""blue""  },  expanded: {}})(MuiExpansionPanel);const ExpansionPanelSummary = withStyles({  root: {    backgroundColor: ""pink""  },  content: {    ""&$expanded"": {      margin: ""12px 0""    }  },  expanded: {}})(MuiExpansionPanelSummary);const ExpansionPanelDetails = withStyles(theme => ({  root: {    padding: theme.spacing(2)  }}))(MuiExpansionPanelDetails);export default function App() {  const [expanded, setExpanded] = React.useState(false);  const handleChange = panel => (event, isExpanded) => {    setExpanded(isExpanded ? panel : false);  };  return (    <>      <ExpansionPanel        expanded={expanded === ""panel1""}        onChange={handleChange(""panel1"")}      >        <ExpansionPanelSummary id=""panel1-header"">          <Typography>Expansion Panel 1</Typography>        </ExpansionPanelSummary>        <ExpansionPanelDetails>          <Typography>            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.          </Typography>        </ExpansionPanelDetails>      </ExpansionPanel>      <ExpansionPanel        expanded={expanded === ""panel2""}        onChange={handleChange(""panel2"")}      >        <ExpansionPanelSummary id=""panel2-header"">          <Typography>Expansion Panel 2</Typography>        </ExpansionPanelSummary>        <ExpansionPanelDetails>          <Typography>Sit amet blandit leo lobortis eget.</Typography>        </ExpansionPanelDetails>      </ExpansionPanel>    </>  );}We pass in the MuiExpansionPanel , MuiExpansionPanelSummary and MuiExpansionPanelDetails into the function returned by the withStyles higher-order component.We make the text color blue and the background of the summary pink.If we use the component, then we’ll see those colors displayed.Photo by Chris Ralston on UnsplashConclusionWe can create expansion panels that expands or collapses as we wish.Also, we can change the styles of each component to fit our needs.JavaScript In Plain EnglishDid you know that we have three publications and a YouTube channel?

How to Use Class-Based Views in Django (When Not to Use Function-Based Views),https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-use-class-based-views-in-django-when-not-to-use-function-based-views-fead2372d3b0?source=tag_archive---------7-----------------------,"Web Development,Coding,Django,Django Rest Framework,Class Based Views","If you have only used function-based generic views in your Django project so far and find out that they are limited, you should think class-based view as a fresh approach to extending those limitations in more complex projects.Class-based viewClass-based view is an alternate way of function-based view. In the beginning, there was only function-based view in Django: “Django passed your function an HttpRequest and expected back an HttpResponse.”Function-based views are obviously useful for simple applications but there is no way to customize or extend them so developers needed an alternative approach.The reason class-based view is way more flexible and extendible than function-based views is Django uses mixins and toolkit of base classes to build class-based views.Using class-based views can seem like more complex because same thing can be achieved by function-based method more easily. But on the other hand, without them more advanced designs would be limited.Implementation of class-based view:Example of function-based views:from django.http import HttpResponsedef my_view(request):    if request.method == 'GET':        # <view logic>        return HttpResponse('result')(taken from docs)Example of class-based views:from django.http import HttpResponsefrom django.views import Viewclass MyView(View):    def get(self, request):        # <view logic>        return HttpResponse('result')(taken from docs)Now because urls.py expecting from you a function that returns an Http response;above example would have raised an error. But class-based views have an as_view() the method which returns a function that can be called when a request arrives for a URL pattern you have determined for a particular page.response = MyView.as_view()(request)after setup() to initialize its attributes anddispatch() to determine whether request method is GET or POST, it returns an HTTP response. But this cycle is more like backstage play. Let’s move onIn order to set this up, in urls.py should be:urlpatterns = [    path('index', MyView.as_view(),name=""index""),]instead of:urlpatterns = [    path('index', views.index,name=""index""),]Since it is returning an Http response like a function-based view, it is possible to use template responses in class view such as to render, redirect, HttpResponseRedirect and so on.Class AttributesThere are two ways to set class attributes;Python way of subclassingclass StartingView(View):    startwith = ""Hello, World!""    def get(self, request):        return HttpResponse(self.startwith)2. Setting class attributes as a keyword to the as_view() function in urls.pyurlpatterns = [    path('about/', StartingView.as_view(startwith=""Hello,World!"")),]Second way is a one-time configuration while in the subclassing method, attributes can be set multiple times.In first way; you can also decorate your view in urls.py like this:urlpatterns = [    path('index/', login_required(TemplateView.as_view(template_name=""secret.html""))),    path('vote/', permission_required('polls.can_vote')(VoteView.as_view())),]ConclusionI have tried to explain the usage of class-based view however I honestly do prefer function-based views for simple cases, especially if I don’t have to repeat the same code. Here is one example:Let’s say you want to add today’s date for your code. In function-based view you can simply write:'today': date.today()With a Class view, on the other hand, what you have to add is this:def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):    context = super().get_context_data(**kwargs)    context['today'] = date.today()    return contextAs a result, class-based can be hard and complex in most of the situations wherein some situations it is extremely helpful.First of all, it helps with the DRY code principle ( Don’t Repeat Yourself) Because once you write your class view, you can use it anywhere.If you do want to integrate your code with Javascript ( or will be using Django Rest Framework) then you will most likely use more class-based views.Photo by Alex Motoc on UnsplashThe StartupMedium's largest active publication, followed by +723K people.

How did I secure videos using Laravel and JavaScript?,https://medium.com/@oussemamiled/how-did-i-secure-videos-using-laravel-and-javascript-1ca60b2a67c6?source=tag_archive---------8-----------------------,"Laravel,Security,Web Development,JavaScript,Tutorial","I am gonna show you what I did to prevent videos link sharing, so they’re only available for subscribed users.I was working on an e-learning website where users obviously gonna watch videos, but the problem was, how to prevent subscribed users from sharing a video source with other unsubscribed users?To secure getting the video source from the database is easy, you can use middlewares or anything that controls access. But after getting the link, it’s hard to prevent the user from copying the link from the source of the web page and share it.“A user is guilty until proven innocent”I kept looking on internet for long time, but I didn’t find an efficient way, even many devs were saying it’s impossible and you can only make it harder for the user to get it.Making it harder means you:Disable the context menu (the right click)Obscure the URLChange the URL frequentlySome other solutions I found but those didn’t suit my requirements and the client’s budget:Make them view it in a custom-built “custom-served” video playerUse a video streaming service already availableYou’ll find an explanation of the above techniques following this link to Stackoverflow.I almost gave up and accepted the idea of ‘’just make it as hard as you can” and my last shot was to try Laravel Signed URLs. It basically appends a “signature” hash to the query string which allows Laravel to verify that the URL has not been modified since it was created. We gonna use specifically temporarySignedRoute method, which means the server generates a URL that expires in a specific period which we choose.To start with, I added these two lines in ‘routes/api.php’:Don’t mind my naming choice pls 😅As you can see, I assigned the ‘signed’ middleware to the second route, that’s why we need to add a line to the $routeMiddleware array in ‘app/http/Kernel.php’Then in ‘VideoController.php’, I implemented both of those methods:Please read carefully the comments in the code because I thought it’s better to explain line by line.After that, on the client side, we request a specific video URL using the first route like so:Still, this is not enough, because if the user seeks an unloaded part of the video after the link expiration, he’ll be blocked too. That’s where we solve the issue using JavaScript. Actually, we need the error (the server not responding with a valid link) to occur, that’s the fun part. Here’s the code I used:The part we need in the HTML fileThe part we need for the JS fileSo when our API responds with an error, theerror event on the video will fire off and we’ll send another request which is identical to the one we sent to get the secure video link in the first place. Then we need to play the video from the exact sought point, so we save it using the currentTime method. We set again the video source, we reload it using load, we seek the point we need when the metadata has been loaded, and finally we play the video.Maybe at this point, you’re wondering about the user experience, like are we gonna do all that while the user still waiting for the video to play again? But you shouldn’t worry about it, it’ll be quick and the user will think it’s only seeking the needed point and streaming servers are already powerful so it should be a fast process.Also, it’s better to mention that the video player will still load the video data even after the link expiration, so if the user just keep watching without seeking any unloaded part, it’ll work perfectly.So with that, I think I succeeded preventing link sharing, even if our users know how to play with the dev tools, especially the network tab, they will still fail cause it’s almost impossible to copy the secure link, to send it and to open the video in just 5 seconds.Feel free to ask or to give your feedback about my solution in the comments section, that will help me make sure it works as expected.Thank you for reading and seeya soon! 😄Written byOussema MiledStudent & Web development enthusiastFollow197 1 197 197 1 LaravelSecurityWeb DevelopmentJavaScriptTutorialMore from Oussema MiledFollowStudent & Web development enthusiastMore From MediumJavaScript Tips #2: Object/Array Deep Clone ImplementationMarco Antonio Ghiani in Better ProgrammingHow To Record Audio in React NativeKrissanawat Kaewsanmuang in JavaScript In Plain EnglishHTML and Templates & JavaScript Template LiteralsAda Rose Cannon in Samsung Internet DevelopersThe 6 New Changes In React v17.0Eric Bandara in JavaScript In Plain EnglishBuilding a React Components LibraryTomasz FiechowskiUsing _writev() to Create a Fast, Writable Stream for ElasticSearchMark BirbeckEquality Operator in JavascriptNavita Singhal in The StartupAdding HTML Content Dynamically in Rails 6 Using jQueryGabriel Hicks in The StartupAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

Source,Web Development,React,Front End Development,Github","身為軟體工程師， Github 自然而然會成為你的好朋友，不論是學校課堂的專案，或是工作上公司的產品，都會使用 Github 或類似的版控平台來管理專案，不過通常這些 project 都會是私人的（但是我的 side project 或是畢業專案都直接設 public，反正根本不會有人想看 😂），不會輕易讓所有人看到專案的程式碼（公司資產）。Github 另一個強大的地方就在於平台上存放著大量的 open source project，像是 React、Deno 等知名開源專案都可以在 github 上看到 source code，而開源的目的就是希望可以藉由社群的力量來維護或讓專案變得更好，人人都可以貢獻自己的一份力量。我希望未來的某一天，我也能夠成為寫出一些開源工具給社群開發者使用的工程師，因此除了平常多多研究 open source code，我也給自己定了一個畢業後半年內要完成的小小目標：第一次貢獻開源專案。首先先推薦一篇文章從 Github 開源指南｜學習如何貢獻開源專案本週我們來讀一下「如何為開源做貢獻」。這份文件是 Github 的 Open Source Guide 開源指南，約莫兩年前剛出的時候全部是英文版的，已經三年了，拖到現在才讀（汗）。medium.com這篇文章說明了貢獻開源專案應有的心態與注意事項，而本篇文章主要是分享自己第一次貢獻的心路歷程，如何實踐並且驗證以上文章的內容。第一步：決定要貢獻哪個專案 ＆ 要貢獻什麼每個開源專案都有一個統整 issue 的地方，我們可以從這之中挑選自己想要做的票來做，很多人都說，第一次 contribute 可以是改錯字或是改變數名稱或是修改失效的連結等技術含量低的 task 來做，然而我希望自己第一次的貢獻可以解決一些實際的問題或有更實質的幫助。問題來了，要解決開源專案的 issue 有個很大的特點就是需要對該專案 source code 夠熟悉，不論是專案裡面使用的技術或是整個架構都要有一定的掌握度，然而以自己目前的實力，要充分理解專案架構實在是有點困難，於是我決定往 util 型的 project 去尋找，frontend 的話以 React 為例可能就是 custom hooks，後端的話則可以朝 middleware 的方向去思考。想了一下後我決定尋找蒐集 custom react hooks 的開源專案，因為自己剛好在工作開發上發現了這方面的需求，想辦法解決自己的需求，這動機再合理不過了吧！?（如果不知道 React custom hooks 是什麼的讀者，可以想像成使用 React 提供的原生 hooks 去實作出符合自己特定需求或是有特定作用的可重用 hooks（可以想成一個特定功能的獨立 function）。）首先來談談自己工作上遇到的需求（只會簡單帶過，因為不是本篇的重點），React 在 component 的 state 管理常使用 React.setState 這個原生 hooks，使用方法如下const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);除了回傳 state 以外，還會回傳一個 state 的 setter function，需求上是往往需要在呼叫 setter function 以後拿新的 state 值做對應的處理，不過問題就是出在 setter 的執行是非同步的，所以沒辦法將要對應的操作直接寫在 setter function call 之後，如果要做到確保拿到最新的 state 值後做對應處理，得使用另一個 React 的原生 hooks useEffect，在 state 值更新後去呼叫useEffect(() => {  //...do some things}, [state]);我認為這樣的寫法有點沒那麼直覺，因此我希望可以寫出能讓 setter function 帶入 callback 的 custom hook，而 callback 可以接收到更新後的 state 值，類似於const [state, setState] = useStateWithCallback(initialvalue);setState(5, (val) => {  console.log(val) //val為5  // ...do something});思考了一下後我認為實作並不算太困難，運用 React 原生的 useRef, useEffect, useCallback 應該就可以達成。Google 了一下也發現有人有做過類似的需求，接下來就是要確認這個需求是否已在開源專案中被別的開發者搶先貢獻了。蒐集 custom react hooks 的開源專案其實滿多的，我挑選了兩個開源專案，幸好確認過兩個專案的 README.md 、open issue、open pull request 後，發現這個需求似乎來沒被別人貢獻過。第一個專案是 github 上擁有 1萬5千多顆星星的 react-usereact-use第二個專案 beautiful-react-hooks 雖然只有 3500 多星星，卻有提供方便的 live playground 給開發者體驗。beautiful-react-hooks最後我選擇了 react-use 作為目標貢獻的專案，因為不管是使用者人數、contributors 人數、甚至是蒐集的 hooks 數量都遠高於另一個專案，不過對我來說最重要的一點是它是使用 TypeScript 開發啊！（熟悉 TS 以後真的回不去了QQ）第二步：閱讀 CONTRIBUTING.md & 開發通常一個完整的開源專案，都會提供一個文檔讓想貢獻的開發者知道如果要貢獻要按照什麼流程進行，react-use 提供了一個 CONTRIBUTING.md 檔案紀錄貢獻步驟通常開發前一定會包含的流程有 fork 專案、clone、開 branch、安裝 dependencies 等等，接下來就可以開始開發了，react-use 規定除了 custom hooks 的檔案外，另外還要撰寫該 hooks 的 unit test、storybook、document 文檔(千萬不要覺得麻煩，這是一個好的專案應該做的事)custom hooks 的 code 還蠻簡單的Custom hooks 的 document 跟 storybook 的 code 就不貼上來了，大部分只要參考別的 hooks 的形式稍作修改就可以了。最後剩下 unit test 的部分，專案的維護者有特別提到希望可以將 testing coverage 盡量做到 100%，其實隨著專案擴大，testing coverage 要維持在接近 100% 並不容易（其實 100% 也不見得就一定是正向指標喔！），不過因為這個專案是偏向蒐集 utilities 的形式，代表測試可以很明確切分成一個一個 hooks 去做 unit test，如果每個貢獻 hooks 的開發者都能確保自己撰寫的 custom hooks 有經過完整的測試，就可以維持整個專案的高 testing coverage 了。在思考測試這方面，我認為我的 hooks 應該要經過以下測試能夠確實設立 initialValue能夠維持原生 React.setState 的功能新加入的 callback 能夠確實接收到更新後的 state value所幸 coverage 有達成 100% ☺️第三步：Pull Request開發步驟都完成後，也通過規定的 test、linting 以後，就可以 push 到自己 fork 後的 repo 再對原本的開源專案發起 pull request 讓社群維護者 review 你的 PR 了。每個專案ㄧ樣都會有規定的 pull request 格式需要遵守，這邊的重點是要用簡潔的話表達你這個 PR 在做的是什麼。Pull Request 成功發出之後，就等待有人來 review 你的 code 給予建議或發起討論，最後擁有 merge 權限的專案維護者在確認沒問題後才會 merge 你的 pull request 到 master branch 裡。幸運的是 PR 發出不久後就得到了一位來自波士頓的開發者的回覆，他提出了兩個想法，第一個更名的想法我覺得他提議的名字確實比原先的好，因此採用了他的意見將 hooks 名稱改成 useStateWithCallback，而第二個建議我則在回應中解釋了自己的想法。到這邊我發現一個嚴重的問題我的英文真的有夠爛。平常看英文文件都沒問題，多益測驗也可以拿到不錯的分數，但是真的要用英文溝通就不太行了，我想我的回應應該充滿了文法錯誤，只希望對方可以看得懂我想表達的意思…小結看到這裡你可能會覺得，接下來要看到這個 PR 被 merge 的過程了，但是很抱歉，這可能要放到下個故事了…。在等待一段時間沒有其他回覆後，我觀察了一下 react-use 這個專案的 pull request 列表，發現有蠻多 pr 現在還卡在那沒有被 merge 或 review 的，接下來看看 project 的 release log，發現在今年 6 月時曾經 release 過蠻多次的，7月的時候卻只有 release 一次，到現在 8 月底就沒有其他的 release 紀錄了。沒想到隔了一個月活躍度居然差這麼大，不知道是否受到了疫情的影響，所以這個 PR 只能繼續放著等待專案維護者來 review 或是 merge 了，如果這個 PR 有後續發展我會更新在這篇文章中，畢竟第一次的 PR 被 merge 對我來說意義重大，希望我的 github 頭貼也能盡快出現在 contributors 行列中😭好想要右下角的位置QQ雖然這是一個未完待續的故事，不過卻是我第一次走一遍開源貢獻的流程，未來希望可以有更多機會貢獻各式各樣的專案，也希望這篇文可以幫助到跟我一樣有開源貢獻夢想的菜鳥工程師，努力跨出那一步吧！feat: new hooks useStateWithCallback by kylemocode · Pull Request #1465 ·

Nó học chung lớp với thằng Bi con cô, cô hỏi điểm mà nó không chịu nói”“Dạ được cô, cô đọc số báo danh của em nó đi, con tra giùm cho” — Tôi ngây thơ trả lời vội vì đinh ninh rằng cô tôi không rành máy tính nên không tự tra đượcCô tôi rep: “Có sbd thì cô tự tra chứ còn nhờ mày làm gì. Cô gửi tên nó qua mày tra hộ cô nhé”Tôi liền nhận lời như một phép lịch sự mặc dù lúc ấy tôi chưa biết phải tra như nào. Và thế là, tôi liền bắt đầu vào mò mẫm chủ đề:TRA ĐIỂM THI ĐH THEO TÊNHồi 1: Tuổi trẻ chưa trải sự đờiHình 1Đây chắc là cách mà hầu hết mọi người đều sẽ nghĩ đến đầu tiên, và tôi cũng không phải ngoại lệ. Và đây là kết quả (hình 2):Hình 2Waooo! Trông kết quả cũng khả quan đấy anh em nhỉ. Tôi háo hức bấm vào đường link đầu tiên. Và đây là những gì tôi nhận được: (hình 3)Hình 3Vâng, với kinh nghiệm của một chàng SV IT, tôi chả lạ gì những chiu trò scam (treo đầu dê bán thịt chó) kiểu này nữa. Tôi tiếp tục click vào những đường link khác, và… (hình 4)Hình 4Đúng là đường nào cũng dẫn về La Mã anh em ạ, Link nào cũng dẫn vào website của BGD :(Hồi 2: Giác ngộTôi như lâm vào đường cùng, cảm giác bí bách, mệt mỏi hiện rõ lên trên khuôn mặt của cậu sinh viên đáng thương. Trong giây phút khó khăn ấy, tôi liền nhớ tới câu nói của một idol: “Không làm mà có ăn, thì chỉ có ăn *** ****, ăn ***”Câu nói ấy như đánh thức bản năng của một SV IT trong tôi, tôi suy nghĩ: thay vì chờ người khác làm cho mình, hay mình thử tìm cách nghịch trang web của BGD xem sao?Hồi 3: Ý tưởngVới những kiến thức được dạy. Tôi bắt tay vào phân tích đề bài.hình 5Đây là những gì chúng ta có:+ Ô nhập số báo danh+ Ô nhập mã captcha + Nút tra cứu + Tên của thằng hàng xómVà đây là những gì chúng ta cần:+ Điểm thi của thằng hàng xómTrông thì chúng có vẻ không liên quan lắm, nhưng hãy chờ xem nhé, kịch hay còn ở phía trước….Trước khi bắt tay vào, chúng ta sẽ suy nghĩ về hướng đi trước, và đây là những gì tôi đã sũy nghĩ trong đầu:- Trang web này không cho tra theo tên, chỉ cho tra theo số báo danh- Vậy nếu nhập sbd vào để tra, thì khả năng cao sẽ hiện ra tên + điểm (giống năm tôi thi ĐH)- Vậy nếu giờ chúng ta nhập lần lượt 10.000 số báo danh (tôi ước lượng) của học sinh lớp 12 Phú Yên vào thì chắc chắn rằng ta sẽ mò ra được tên của thằng nhóc hàng xóm và điểm của nó (hình minh họa bên dưới)Ok, chiến thuật đã xong. Nghe hơi vô lý nhưng lại cực kỳ thuyết phục anh em ạ. Tuy nhiên, chỉ idea thôi thì chưa đủ, làm được mới đáng chân quý.Hồi 3: Đương đầuÔng bà ta có câu “Biết địch biết ta, trăm trận trăm thắng”vậy nên, để có thể nghịch được trang này, trước tiên chúng ta cần nắm sơ qua cách hoạt động của nó bằng cách: thử trả điểm thi của 1 thí sinh.Mà khoan… SBD đâu ra mà tra nhỉ, tôi nhập bừa 1 số nào đó , và kết quả (hình 6)Hình 6Ok, chướng ngại vật đầu tiên: Tìm đâu ra 10,000 sbd của thí sinh Phú Yên trong 1 triệu thí sinh của cả nước?Hồi 4: Truy tìm 10k sbdSau khi tìm hiểu thì tôi biết được, mỗi tỉnh thành khác nhau đều sẽ có 1 trang web riêng để tra cứu thí sinh của tỉnh mình (hình 7)Hình 7Như vậy, trang web của tình Phú Yên sẽ chỉ tra được điểm của học sinh Phú Yên mà thôi. Thông tin này rất hữu ích, vì nó sẽ cho ta biết được trang web này sẽ chỉ lưu số báo danh từ số XXXXX → XXXXX ( khoảng 10k đơn vị, dựa vào số lượng học sinh thi THPT 2020 ở Phú Yên). Tôi tạm gọi 2 sốnày là số báo danh min và số báo danh max.Xác định được 2 cực này sẽ giúp rút gọn thời gian tìm kiếm rất nhiều vì ở VN tới gần 1 triệu thí sinh tham gia thi THPT, so với 10k ở Phú Yên thì con số này đang lớn hơn rất nhiều.Để xác định được sbd min và sbd max. Trước tiên ta cần 1 sbd nằm ở giữa khoảng này (sbd của một hs Phú Yên bất kỳ). Có 2 cách để tìm sbd này:Cách 1: hỏi bạn bè, người thân, xin 1 sbd của người quen. Trong trường hợp không có bạn bè, người thân nào cho bạn sbd thì yên tâm, vẫn còn cách 2 nhé.Cách 2: Cách của mấy hacker hay làm :v (search google)Khả năng cao là sẽ không có ai rãnh mà public sbd của mình lên mạng vì một mục đích gì cả…Trừ khi…. Yeah, bạn là thủ khoa =))Ok, chúng ta bắt đầu tra google nào. Phú Yên năm nào chả có thủ khoa :vHình 8Và kết quả:Hình 939…89. Chính nó ae ạ. Tuy không hiện đầy đủ, nhưng như vậy là quá đủ với mình rồi. Vậy tính ra sẽ có vài trường hợp có thể xảy ra đối với sbd này:- 39X89-39XX89-….-39XXXX89Mình sẽ thử lần lượt từng option và thay X bằng số 0.Quá đen cho mình là thử đến lần thứ 4 mới đúng =))Hình 10Ok, Vậy là 39000089 sẽ là điểm xuất phát để ta tìm sbd max và sbd min. Nhìn hình 11 cho dễ hiểu haHình 11Vì chúng ta ko biết là 39000089 nằm ở vị trí nào trên trục tọa độ này nên để chắc ăn nhất ta có thể khoanh vùng như sau:- SBD 1 (min) : có giá trị tầm 39000089 — 10000 = 38990089- SBD 10k (max): có giá trị tầm 39000089 + 10000 = 39010089Ok, vậy là xong thử thách đầu tiên, chúng ta đã giới hạn được vùng tìm kiếm của mục tiêu và tìm ra đc 10,000 sbd thí sinh của tỉnh PY nằm trong vùng 38990089 -> 39010089Hình 12Hồi 5: Captcha (Hồi kết)Giờ chúng ta đã có trong tay toàn bộ sbd của thí sinh tỉnh PY, việc còn lại cực kỳ đơn giản, Mình sẽ viết một dòng lệnh cho phép máy tính tự động nhập và tra lần lượt sbd từ 38990089 -> 39010089 để tìm ra được mục tiêu….“Máy tính không thông minh hơn con người. Nó chỉ nhanh hơn rất, rất, rất, rất nhiều lần con người”….Khoan đã… hình như mình đã bỏ lỡ điều gì đó ? “Mã xác nhận” — Captcha (hình 13)Hình 13Cho một số bạn chưa biết thì những mã như này mục đích sinh ra là để chặn những thằng như mình đó =)) .Máy tính đủ nhanh để điền giúp bạn hàng chục nghìn sbd nhưng nó không đủ thông minh để hiểu và điền dòng mã captcha này. Ngoài ra còn có các loại captcha khác hiện đại và tinh vi hơn, VD như: - “Tìm cột đèn giao thông”- “Tìm xe ô tô trong hình”- “Tìm vạch kẻ đường”…..nghe quen ko =))Tất tần tật những loại captcha này đều nhằm mục giảm thiểu tốc độ xử lý hàng loạt của máy tính cho những công việc “sai trái” :vOk, giới thiệu sơ như vậy đủ rồi. Vấn đề bây giờ là:Mỗi lần nhập sbd để tra điểm, thì bắt buộc mình phải nhập kèm theo 1 captcha mới tương ứng (vì máy tính không tự nhập đc). Với 10k thí sinh thì mình không thể làm điều đó bằng tay được. Vậy có cách nào ?Mình thử mở source code của trang web và xem cách hoạt động của captcha này. Và mình tìm được đoạn code sau: (có vietsub cho ai ko rành code)Hình 14Aha, mình phát hiện ra một điều là có vẻ như bạn dev code cái web này hơi bị “lười”, bạn ấy xử phần reset captcha ở dưới máy tính của người dùng (client) nên việc mình có thể can thiệp và sửa đổi cực kỳ đơn giản.Mình chỉ việc tìm và xóa đi câu lệnh gạch đỏ (hình 14) là xong, như vậy trang web sẽ không yêu cầu mình nhập captcha mới mỗi lần tra điểm nữa.Vậy là hoàn tất chốt chặn cuối cùng. Công việc còn lại của mình là viết 1 đoạn mã Javascript cho máy tính tự động nhập sbd từ 38990089 -> 39010089 vào là xongThành quả: (hình 15)Hình 15Lời sau cùng:Bài viết này nhằm mục đích chia sẻ kiến thức vui vẻ là chính. Tình huống mình kể ở trên hoàn toàn là hư cấu :)) . Hi vọng chủ nhân của trang web này nếu muốn có thể nâng cấp trang web tốt hơn để vá lỗi này.Chúc các bạn có một ngày cuối tuần vui vẻWritten byKrakien NgôFollow2 2 2 HackingCodingVietnamWeb DevelopmentMore from Krakien NgôFollowMore From MediumWhy you should be using React FragmentsAaron S in JavaScript In Plain EnglishDistributed Sprints KitCheechee Lin in Dropbox DesignMission Accomplished?

Dear Junior Software Developer…,https://medium.com/@juli4geek/dear-junior-software-developer-5e2081e0a95f?source=tag_archive---------11-----------------------,"Software Development,Web Development,Career Advice,Software Engineering","This is a letter to you, as you start on your terrifying, amazing and sometimes frustrating journey into the bowels of modern software engineering. I tried to summarize for you some lessons I learnt after 4 years and 7 jobs as a software developer.Lesson 1. Decide what kind of software developer you want to be — it will be easier for you down the lineI will start with the very beginning. When I decided to change careers and become a software developer, my then-mentor said it would be better to learn basic programming concepts if I started with JavaScript, which may have been somewhat correct, and somewhat not. Later down the line, I fell in love with Python and Data Science, but it’s way more difficult to switch now that I have years of experience in web development.So, I think it would be good to understand very well what types of software development jobs exist on the market before you decide on the path you want to take. I don’t detest what I do now, because I’m fascinated by the process of developing software and building stuff, but I do regret not giving it more thought and not doing more research before starting my career in the field.How can you know what the various programming roles are about? Ask people who work in those roles to tell you. (I just had the brilliant idea of starting a series on this topic. Let me know if you would be interested in finding out what every software engineering role is about and I will try to reach out to people and interview them about their day-to-day work).Lesson 2. There is no perfect software development job out therehttps://www.monkeyuser.com/2017/web-app-visualized/When I started, I had this idea in my mind about finding the “perfect” job in the “perfect” company. What did that look for me? Nicely written, well structured code, helpful senior software developers that would guide me as I grow, clear processes, plenty of time for both feature delivery and refactoring, unit testing to cover every aspect of the code, amazing QA who would catch all bugs in the blink of an eye…The more I think about this image of perfection, the more I giggle thinking how far from reality it is, especially in a young company.There is no perfect code. Most of the time you’ll inherit poorly written and/or structured code that you’ll hate. Maybe you’ll hate parts of it and love some other parts. Most code is bad because it was sometimes written without the intention to be pushed to production or kept for so long, or back then, the team had no architect or senior developer, so decisions were made that were regretted later on.There are no senior developers who are there to help you. If you find one, cherish every second spent with that person and suck information from them like a vampire. Seriously. Most senior devs I know are busy over their heads leading refactoring efforts, writing technical designs, solving production bugs and, in extreme cases, keeping the code from not collapsing.There are, however, good teams and bad teams. Teams where collaboration replaces competition and where you have partners to pair program with.Lesson 3. Side projects will help you grow fast(er)https://www.monkeyuser.com/2020/side-project-showcase/I spent way more time than I want to admit reading technical books and/ or looking at “how-to” videos on the internet (which let you dip your toes in a framework/ language, but nothing more). Don’t do that. Start a side project using the tech stack you want to learn. And no, not another to-do list, please! You don’t have to come up with an original idea (although that would definitely bring you closer to early retirement). Some examples of good side projects:Virtual library, with books that you can add/ remove, rate, filter per genre and rating.What should I wear today? Clothes randomizer to speed up decision-making. The more advanced you are, the more rules you add to the algorithm (color matching, mood, time of day, season, occasion).Simple social media website (implement the basic functionality of the big ones out there: Facebook, Instagram, Reddit).E-commerce website (I am currently working on a side project for one)Computer game (start with Tic-Tac-Toe or the Google no-internet T-rex game).Family website. A profile for each family member with photos. You can implement a full CMS solution, where family members can edit their own profiles, write blog posts etc. Bonus: add an interactive family tree.A more enterprise app would be: dashboard with charts (look for datasets on Kaggle.com, they have plenty). Each chart has its own widget/card and you can apply filters so that the charts update (that’s a bit more advanced).These are all full-stack projects. It’s difficult to produce something that’s easy to show for back-end only, so try to keep the front-end minimal and focus on the back-end stuff if you want to grow in that direction.Why are side projects great opportunities to grow?First, because you have an end goal in your learning. I noticed that if I aimlessly read books and technical articles, I find nice ideas, but I always forget them if I don’t use them in practice.Second, because such a project is teaching you to be self-reliant. When you’re on your own, there’s no senior developer you can turn to in case you get stuck or you run into trouble. The side effect will be that you’ll grow more confident in your own capabilities (because now you have proven to yourself you can be self-reliant). That’s a good cure for the “impostor syndrome”.SIDE NOTE: if you don’t like side projects, you can also start volunteering in open source. A lot of open source repo’s on GitHub have “Good first issue” tags to help you start. I might write more about this in a future post.LATER EDIT: I just received this article from Dev.to of a list of full-stack projects you can work on before 2020 ends (I’d say, work on them whenever and don’t look at the technologies they use there. Just take the project ideas and implement them in your favorite tech stack.)Lesson 4. If you want to write better code, find good code and imitate itIn your programming journey, you’ll inevitably find people who are “subject matter experts”, that is, who know a library, a language or a framework inside and out. Who probably have repositories with code examples on GitHub. Look at their code, study it and try to imitate the parts you like. Maybe you admire the concise way in which they write code (I am a sucker for clean, functional-style code). Maybe you see a nice project structure, or a script you find useful. Feel free to get in touch with them and ask them questions if you don’t fully understand something. People are generally open to answering questions about their code.Never copy code without understanding how it works. There’s no benefit in that.Lesson 5. Seniority != number of yearsWhat a shocker, right? While in other professions, number of years in the field matter, in software development, they are not a clear indication of somebody’s seniority. You can remain a junior or a mid-level developer for a very long time, it’s all up to you how fast you grow. So what’s the difference between a junior and a senior developer? There are plenty of articles written on this topic, one of my favorites being this one and this one.Lesson 6. Software development is not only about writing codeYou should forget about the idea that in order to be a good software developer, you should only be concerned with writing good code and delivering features. That’s only half of the job.The other half is understanding in detail what that code is meant to do. The clearer you have that in your head (or written down) when you start writing the code, the easier it will be for you (and the faster you can deliver the code).Let me try to give you an example.“Implement an employee performance page”, is a poor description of what I want. You have to fill in a lot of blanks by yourself, but you don’t want to do that, because then you will start assuming a lot of stuff.What if I told you: “Implement an employee profile page, showing charts for each skill of the employee and how those skills compare to those of his peers.” That would definitely be better, but still not enough for you to start implementing the page.“Implement an employee profile page, showing the following: — one chart for each of his top 4 skills, with one line representing the average of that skill across similar positions, and one line representing the employees’ own skill development over time. Another chart, a scatter plot positioning the employee among his peers, drawn based on the employees’ experience on the x axis and the employees’ total rating on the y axis”. Much better.Why is this so important? Because you want to avoid making assumptions. Or making assumptions and not verifying them with the people who requested the feature. Assumptions are dangerous because you think you understand something, but if you don’t have a very good knowledge of the context and the reasons why that was requested, then you are probably missing important details. And even if I had perfect understanding of the context and the reasons, I would still double check everything before getting to work.So, if you are to take one single thing from this article, is this:In software development, as in life, assumption is the mother of all fu*k-ups.Lesson 7. The bigger picture is important to becoming a better developerI had an epiphany regarding what it means to be a software developer while listening to Jessica Kerr in this brilliant podcast: https://changelog.com/podcast/398She makes the point that the one thing developers should know is how the system they build interacts with other systems and how the various parts of the system interact with each other. This is important because everything impacts everything in more or less obvious ways. This becomes very clear while bug hunting (my favorite activity).For example, within the system, the way we write queries impacts database performance and query speed. The way in which the user is allowed to interact with the front-end of the app impacts the server by the number of requests the server needs to resolve. Poorly secured front-end/ back-end impact the whole app.So, to be a good software developer, you need to be able to understand the whole picture, how the code you write fits in it and how all parts of the system interact with each other.So that’s all I’ve got (so far). I’m sure this list will be different for you, and I’m looking forward to hear what lessons you’ll learn or have learnt already in your journey.Written byJulia MihetWeb developer, amateur runner, adventurer, geek, aspiring data explorerFollow13 2 13 13 2 Software DevelopmentWeb DevelopmentCareer AdviceSoftware EngineeringMore from Julia MihetFollowWeb developer, amateur runner, adventurer, geek, aspiring data explorerMore From MediumBarcode Scanners SimplifiedDino BuljubasicSwiftUI and the Missing Environment ObjectMichael Long in The StartupHow to Love Kubernetes and Not Wreck The Planet Part I: Elasticity and UtilizationHolly K Cummins in IBM GarageCongrats!

The story of my worst Javascript bug,https://medium.com/dev-genius/the-story-of-my-worst-javascript-bug-39c441a70237?source=tag_archive---------12-----------------------,"JavaScript,Development,Software Development,Code,Web Development","Photo by Julia Joppien on UnsplashLets get some context of around this story before we dig into the code.I am Daniel, a swedish Javascript developer with about 6 years of development in my backpack. Here’s what i went through…I was setting up a new Node project like many times before. This time i was going to be pragmatic about testing. Yeah, the usual mindset when starting a new project.I created a repo, did a npm init and installed my first dev dependencies. I went for Jest and babel-jest along with it. I configured babel with @babel/preset-env. @babel/preset-env takes any target environments you've specified and checks them against its mappings to compile a list of plugins and passes it to Babel. Great! Modern Javascript is the way to fly.I created an index.js file and added a simple function to it. I looked online for a small fun function. I didn’t find a fun one. Instead i went for this one.Now I wanted to make sure Jest worked so i created a index.spec.js and added a first test:I don’t have to tell you it didn’t work. Do you see why?No you can’t and neither did I!At least Jest gave me a syntax error:Ah ok so probably there is a Babel error? Node does not understand the spread syntax of ES6. I guess I have to add babel plugins to support spread syntax?In the following 2 hours I tried all possible ways of configuring Babel and Jest. I tried adding things from popular Node with Jest boilerplates and even Webpack boilerplates but I always got to the same error.At this point I wanted to try a function without the spread syntax just to see something work on my computer before giving up my career as a developer.I went to delete the 3 spread dots and was very confused to see that all 3 disappeared with just one hard punch on my backspace button. I reversed the deletion to have a closer look. The 3 dots seem to be in only one character and now my brain clicked.The special unicode character “Horizontal ellipsis” had cost me hours.Damn you “Horizontal ellipsis”.I went on a deep dive into special unicode characters and here are some of the the unicode characters from hell that can mess up your whole day:For me the problem was that I was looking for Babel errors, not syntax errors and the only way for me to detect this syntax error was that the 3 dots were a bit smaller and a bit tighter together than usual.Im happy to have shared this with you so that you leap no risk of getting confused the same way I was.Hope you enjoyed the read!If you also like code content in video format check out my youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/barelycodingDev GeniusCoding, Tutorials, News, UX, UI and much more related to developmentFollow26 Sign up for Best StoriesBy Dev GeniusThe best stories sent monthly to your email. Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

How to create a slider with React Hooks and TypeScript,https://medium.com/@sebastien_40527/ow-to-create-a-slider-with-react-hooks-and-typescript-3bc14827c234?source=tag_archive---------13-----------------------,"React,Front End Development,React Hook,Typescript,Web Development","There are hundreds of slider plugins on github or npm. Most of the time you will use some library components as Ant Design or Material-UI. But sometimes your slider needs to be completely customizable, and even with the HTML <input> tag it may be difficult to answer exactly your clients needs.That is why I wrote this article to explain how to implement a slider using react Hooks and TypeScript. It is a basic slider and it is free to you to improve this for your own needs.The demo slider we will create after reading this articleStyled-ComponentsI am going to use CodePen to demonstrate my slider. For CSS, I used styled-component that is allow me to implement all my slider in JavaScript. The finished slider will have a custom background color. Since the CSS depends very much on what effect you would like to achieve, please only take reference of mine, and tweak it as you wish, or simply write your own.First of all, I implemented a wrapper to contain all the element of my slider, I vertically centered my slider inside the wrapper thanks to flexBox. And if there are marks above the slider I put some margin to do not have marks above other content inside your web page.export type WrapperProps = { marks?: boolean;};export const Wrapper = styled.div<WrapperProps>` position: relative; display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;${props => props.marks && css`   margin-top: 25px;  margin-left: 15px;  margin-right: 15px;`}`;Secondly, I implemented the dot. So the dot is a little bit tricky because the position must change really quickly, that is why I must use “attrs” method of styled components. Otherwise, you will have “the 200+ class generation issue” and you could have some bugs in your slider.export interface DotStyledProps { readonly position?: number; readonly backgroundColor?: string;}export const DotStyled = styled.button.attrs((props: DotStyledProps)=> ({ style: {  left: `${props.position}%`,},}))<DotStyledProps>` all: unset; z-index: 100; position: absolute; height: 15px; width: 15px; border-radius: 50%; background-color: ${props => props.backgroundColor}; top: 50%; transform: translate(-50%, -50%); cursor: pointer;`;Thirdly, I made the line. So the line is grey and my line contain an other line to fill in yellow my line in grey. For the same reason than before I used “attrs” because my component generate a lot of class.export type LineFillProps = { position?: number; backgroundColor?: string;};export const LineFill = styled.div.attrs((props: LineFillProps) => ({ style: {  width: `${props.position}%`,},}))<LineFillProps>` height: 100%; background-color: ${props => props.backgroundColor};`;export type LineStyledProps = { backgroundColor?: string;};export const LineStyled = styled.div<LineStyledProps>` height: 3px; background-color: ${props => props.backgroundColor};`;Finally, I implemented marks, because it is better to have some marks for user of the slider.export type MarksStyledProps = { position?: number; backgroundColor?: string;};export const MarksStyled = styled.div<MarksStyledProps>` z-index: 10; position: absolute; height: 8px; width: 2px; background-color: ${props => props.backgroundColor}; left: ${props => `${props.position}%`}; top: 50%; transform: translate(-50%, -50%);`;export const MarksText = styled.div` position: absolute; bottom: 15px; transform: translate(-50%, 0);`;TypeScript and HooksThe main point of my article is that I used TypeScript and Hooks to implement my slider. I used TypeScript principally because it is statically type language and there is a lot of advantages to use it, but I will talk about them in other article !First of all, in TypeScript I have to declare properly my props :interface Marks { min: number; max: number;}interface SliderProps { unFocusColor?: string; focusColor?: string; style?: React.CSSProperties; className?: string; onChange?: (value: number) => void; value?: number; marks?: Marks; step?: number; min?: number; max?: number; unit?: string;}Then I can construct my Slider with the props that I declare above :const Slider = (props: SliderProps) => { const {  style,  className,  onChange,  value,  marks,  step,  min,  max,  unit,  unFocusColor,  focusColor, } = props;Each part the code is exlained below!}Slider.defaultProps = { step: 0.1, min: 0, max: 100, unit: ""%"", focusColor:""#f8b500"", unFocusColor:""#BBBBBB"",};I initialize my states and my ref:“enable” is set to true when I use the event onMouseDown on the dot and is set to false in using onMouseUp event to all the window.“positionCursorPercentage” is the position of the dot in percentage of the width of the line.“positionCursor” is the position of the dot in value.“slide” is the ref of the wrapper. It is very important to get the width and to position the dot inside the wrapper!const [enable, setEnable] = React.useState(false);const [positionCursorPercentage, setPositionCursorPercentage] = React.useState(  value ? ((value - min) / (max - min)) * 100 : 0 );const [positionCursor, setPositionCursor] = React.useState(value ? value : min);const slide = React.useRef(null);So with that variables, I can update the position of my cursor each time that state “enable” is assigned to true and my mouse is moving :React.useEffect(() => {  const rect = slide.current.getBoundingClientRect();  const minPosition = 0;  const maxPosition = rect.width;  let positionAbsolute = positionCursorPercentage;  window.onmousemove = (ev: MouseEvent): any => {   const position = vertical ? rect.y + rect.height - ev.clientY : ev.clientX - rect.x;   if (enable) {    window.onmouseup = (evMouseUp: MouseEvent): any => {     setEnable(false);    };    if (position < minPosition) {     positionAbsolute = min;    } else if (position > maxPosition) {     positionAbsolute = max;    } else {     positionAbsolute = (position / maxPosition) * (max - min) + min;    }if (     positionAbsolute <= positionCursorPercentage + step &&     positionAbsolute >= positionCursorPercentage - step    ) {     positionAbsolute = positionCursorPercentage;    }    positionAbsolute = Math.round(positionAbsolute * (1 / step)) / (1 / step);    if (onChange) {     onChange(positionAbsolute);    } else {     setPositionCursor(positionAbsolute);    }   }  }; }, [enable]);Then I translate the position of my cursor from absolute to percentage to set the position of my dot in percentage of the width of the line:React.useEffect(() => {  if (value) {   onChangePositionOfCursor(value);  } else {   onChangePositionOfCursor(positionCursor);  } }, [value, positionCursor]);const onChangePositionOfCursor = (positionAbsolute: number) => {  setPositionCursorPercentage(((positionAbsolute - min) / (max - min)) * 100); };const valueOfCursor =  Math.round(((positionCursorPercentage / 100) * (max - min) + min) * step) / step;Finally, I return my slider with the different component that I declared thanks to styled-component.  return (   <Wrapper    marks={marks ? true : false}    ref={slide}    className={className}    style={style}   >    <LineStyled backgroundColor={unFocusColor}>     <LineFill      backgroundColor={focusColor}      position={positionCursorPercentage}     ></LineFill>    </LineStyled>    <DotStyled     backgroundColor={focusColor}     position={positionCursorPercentage}     onMouseDown={() => setEnable(true)}    >    </DotStyled>{marks ? (     <>      <MarksStyled       backgroundColor={focusColor}       position={((marks.min - min) / (max - min)) * 100}      >       <MarksText>        {marks.min}        {unit}       </MarksText>      </MarksStyled>      <MarksStyled       backgroundColor={focusColor}       position={((marks.max - min) / (max - min)) * 100}      >       <MarksText>        {marks.max}        {unit}       </MarksText>      </MarksStyled>     </>    ) : null}   </Wrapper>  );How to use this component in React?I just show you below how to use the slider we constructed before with TypeScript and Styled-Component.const SliderExemple = () => { const [value, setValue] = React.useState(15);const onChangeValue = e => {  setValue(e); }; return (  <>   <div style={{ width: ""50%"", marginTop: ""50px"" }}>    <Slider     min={1}     max={20}     marks={{ min: 1, max: 20 }}     value={value}     onChange={e => onChangeValue(e)}     step={1}     tooltipVisible     unit=""€""    ></Slider>     </div>  </> );};ReactDOM.render(  <div>  <SliderExemple/>  </div>,  mountNode,);FINALLY!

Should You Learn Wordpress in 2020?,https://medium.com/@thanesh.pannirselvam/should-you-learn-wordpress-in-2020-ee1c66d43a95?source=tag_archive---------14-----------------------,"WordPress,Web Development,Business,Entrepreneurship,Programming","Photo by Stephen Philips on UnsplashDid you know that WordPress powers over 30% of websites you see on the internet today?Or perhaps you hadn’t even heard of WordPress until now.Either way, you should know that big companies like Sony, Walt Disney and Bloomberg all rely on this platform to run their sites. However, if you’ve come across popular tech forums or subreddits, you’ll often see plenty of hate thrown towards this platform. Some of this may be warranted, but others not so much.What is Wordpress?For those who don’t know, Wordpress is an open-source software that allows people to create websites without much hassle. Both beginners and advanced users can create nearly any website using this platform and do so relatively efficiently too.Before you go learning anything, you should be aware of the two WordPress platforms available; wordpress.com and wordpress.org. The first is a for profit version which is simple to use but lacks flexibility. The second is a self-hosted platform which enables a range of customisability and full control over your site. This version seems to be more popular in the tech community and is the one I’ll be discussing in this article.Reasons why you should learn WordpressSay you have business idea and a relatively low budget. You could learn Wordpress, use pre-made extensions and have your site running within a matter of days. This is not to say there isn’t a learning curve but rather the curve isn’t as steep as learning to code from scratch. So here are just some of the questions you might be asking yourself.How hard is it?Even if you’re from a non-tech background, you can work out how to navigate yourself around WordPress. The platform has a straightforward interface that most people can use with enough practice. To get started, all you have to do is find a host, install the Wordpress dashboard and add some content.That’s it! You have a site. But…You’ll definitely want to add some customisation and functionality to your site. This will take a bit of learning but don’t worry there’s plenty of tutorials out there to help you grasp those ropes.How extensible is it?A big part of what makes WordPress so powerful is it’s themes and plugins. Themes handle the look and feel of your website while plugins add functionality. Well designed themes can leave your site looking aesthetic, vibrant and professional. Combine these with plugins and you have fully functional site, all managed by you. This means that you can channel your energy towards managing content rather than development. Keep in mind that theres usually a mix of free and paid options out there.Will I be able to change things easily?Yes you will.Any time you need to make changes, you can head back into your dashboard and update as necessary. Perhaps your business is starting to gain traction but you realise that prices need updating. All you have to do is access your website’s dashboard, navigate to the correct spot and make this change.Even better, imagine you need to add a booking or calendar feature for your customers but forgot to add that in initially.No problem…..There’s probably a plugin for that.So why all the hate then?Well… some people dislike WordPress as they consider it to be ‘bloated’ or perhaps ‘uncool’. And they’re right, sometimes WordPress sites can get slow if you install heavy themes or rely on too many plugins. However, with enough exposure you will certainly learn how to evaluate these extensions and control the weight of your site.Fact is there are many ‘cooler’ things out there but perhaps there is no reason to re-invent the wheel.Written byThanesh PannirselvamWeb Developer based in Melbourne, Australia. https://thanesh.ioFollow51 51 51 WordPressWeb DevelopmentBusinessEntrepreneurshipProgrammingMore from Thanesh PannirselvamFollowWeb Developer based in Melbourne, Australia. https://thanesh.ioMore From MediumSEO and Content Marketing: How Differences Make It HappenJenna BrandonWhat My First Year In Business Taught Me About BrandingShauna Armitage in The StartupWhat I Learned From Flipping My First Pair of SneakersDaan in Better MarketingHow To Get Inside Your Customer’s HeadFelicia C.

Generics in PHP via PHPDocs,https://medium.com/@voku/generics-in-php-via-phpdocs-b987c5d6efab?source=tag_archive---------15-----------------------,"PHP,Coding,Web Development","first published here: https://suckup.de/2020/08/generics-in-php-via-phpdocs/If you did not know that you can use Generics in PHP or you do not exactly know how to use it or why you should use it, then the next examples are for you.Type variables via @templateThe @template tag allows classes and functions to declare a generic type parameter. The next examples starts with simple functions, so that we understand how it works, and then we will see the power of this in classes.A dummy function that will return the input.⇾ https://phpstan.org/r/1922279b-9786-4523-939d-dddcfd4ebb86<?php        /**     * @param \Exception $param     * @return \Exception     *     * @template T of \Exception     * @psalm-param T $param     * @psalm-return T     */    function foo($param) { ... }    foo(new \InvalidArgumentException()); // The static-analysis-tool knows that                                           // the type is still ""\InvalidArgumentException""                                           // because of the type variable.@template T of \Exception // here we create a new type variable, and we force that it must be an instance of \Exception@phpstan-param T $param // here we say that the static-analysis-tool need to remember the type that this variable had before (you can use @psalm-* or @phpstan-* both works with both tools)@phpstan-return T // and that the return type is the same as the input typeA simple function that gets the first element of an array or a fallback.In the @param PHPDocs we write “mixed” because this function can handle different types.

Material UI — Snack Bars,https://medium.com/dev-genius/material-ui-snack-bars-99097d8a4545?source=tag_archive---------16-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Ricardo Henrique Vergilio on UnsplashMaterial UI is a Material Design library made for React.It’s a set of React components that have Material Design styles.In this article, we’ll look at how to add snack bars with Material UI.SnackbarSnack bars let us display messages about something happening in our app.To create a simple one, we can use the Snackbar component.For example, we can write:import React from ""react"";import Button from ""@material-ui/core/Button"";import Snackbar from ""@material-ui/core/Snackbar"";import IconButton from ""@material-ui/core/IconButton"";import CloseIcon from ""@material-ui/icons/Close"";export default function App() {  const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(false);  const handleClick = () => {    setOpen(true);  };  const handleClose = (event, reason) => {    if (reason === ""clickaway"") {      return;    }    setOpen(false);  };  return (    <div>      <Button onClick={handleClick}>Open snackbar</Button>      <Snackbar        anchorOrigin={{          vertical: ""bottom"",          horizontal: ""left""        }}        open={open}        autoHideDuration={6000}        onClose={handleClose}        message=""hello world""        action={          <React.Fragment>            <Button color=""secondary"" size=""small"" onClick={handleClose}>              ok            </Button>            <IconButton size=""small"" color=""inherit"" onClick={handleClose}>              <CloseIcon fontSize=""small"" />            </IconButton>          </React.Fragment>        }      />    </div>  );}We created a snack bar with the message is set to 'hello world' .And we have more content in the action prop.They include a button that we can click and an IconButton to let us close the snack bar.Customized Snack BarsWe can style snack bars with various styles.To style it, we add the severity prop.For instance, we can write:import React from ""react"";import MuiAlert from ""@material-ui/lab/Alert"";function Alert(props) {  return <MuiAlert elevation={6} variant=""filled"" {...props} />;}export default function App() {  return (    <div>      <Alert severity=""error"">error!</Alert>      <Alert severity=""warning"">warning!</Alert>      <Alert severity=""info"">info!</Alert>      <Alert severity=""success"">success!</Alert>    </div>  );}Instead of using the Snackbar component, we used the Alert component instead.It’s in the @material-ui/lab package instead of the @material-ui/core package.Positioned Snack BarsWe can position the snack bar with the anchorOrigin prop.To position it, we can write:import React from ""react"";import Snackbar from ""@material-ui/core/Snackbar"";import Button from ""@material-ui/core/Button"";export default function App() {  const [state, setState] = React.useState({    open: false,    vertical: ""top"",    horizontal: ""center""  });  const { vertical, horizontal, open } = state;  const handleClick = newState => () => {    setState({ open: true, ...newState });  };  const handleClose = () => {    setState({ ...state, open: false });  };  return (    <div>      <Button onClick={handleClick({ vertical: ""top"", horizontal: ""center"" })}>        open      </Button>      <Snackbar        anchorOrigin={{ vertical, horizontal }}        open={open}        onClose={handleClose}        message=""hello world""      />    </div>  );}to set the position of the snack bar with the anchorOrigin prop.It’s set to an object with the vertical and horizontal properties.We set it to 'top' and 'center' respectively to show it at the top of the screen and centered.Message LengthThe width can vary in back bars.We can write a long message by writing text in multiple lines:import React from ""react"";import Snackbar from ""@material-ui/core/Snackbar"";import Button from ""@material-ui/core/Button"";export default function App() {  const [state, setState] = React.useState({    open: false  });  const { open } = state;  const handleClick = () => {    setState({ open: true });  };  const handleClose = () => {    setState({ ...state, open: false });  };  return (    <div>      <Button onClick={handleClick}>open</Button>      <Snackbar        open={open}        onClose={handleClose}        message={          ""Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.  \          Aenean mollis, metus vitae vestibulum suscipit, eros nisi ultrices urna.""        }        action={          <Button color=""secondary"" size=""small"">            lorem ipsum dolorem          </Button>        }      />    </div>  );}We have the message prop with a string expression that spans multiple lines but without line breaks.Also, we have the action prop to show a button.Photo by Ola Mishchenko on UnsplashConclusionWe can use snack bars to display different messages.They can be styled and we can apply transitions to it.Dev GeniusCoding, Tutorials, News, UX, UI and much more related to developmentFollow175 Sign up for Best StoriesBy Dev GeniusThe best stories sent monthly to your email. Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

These two are the best social media right now for blogs.You can make a website and start. If you have some spare time, You can learn and start with WordPress. It is worth it.If you want to start right now, You can start with Blogger, Wix, Weebly, Squarespace. (please search on google if you don’t know about them)2. Do User Testing (It’s not hard)It’s an easy thing if you like to review technical things like website designs, products, logos, or other digital things.AdvantagesYou can start a service just by signing up for some User Testing websites.It’s quick cash.It’s a very simple process.DisadvantagesIt is not a big amount of cash.Not relevant for a full career, just a boost.Have a little bit of competition.You have to be a person who can talk to people on phone calls without difficulties.How to startThe starting is very very easy. Websites like Usertesting, I have experience in web testings so, I suggest TryMyUI, Enroll.

You can try Shopify instead of WordPress. But it may be a little bit costly.Anyways, after making the website, You go to AliExpress or Amazon and copy some products and put it on your site. The source website will do the delivery and all thing.Charge a little more than the source website so, when they buy the product you get the extra money in your pocket and the original price will get paid to the source.advantagesIt’s a good start.You can make a good business.It is automatic money after doing some setups.DisadvantagesYou should have some technical skills.You have to make some arrangements so the customers buy from your site, like making a blog to promote.You have to do some payments monthly.

Because It is a big kingdom of business opportunities.Freelancing is very good if you have an interest in learning things, if you like working independently, and if you have patience.However, If you can’t find a good route to start or if you aren’t persistent, It will be hard for you. I can’t stress that enough.What Is It?It’s the works you will do on professional jobs or service businesses. You have to choose your category and start.You can be a freelance writer, artist, engineer, designer, virtual assistant, consultant, strategist, carpenter, painter, developer, and even gamer.How can it be a service from home or while traveling?If the service you provide is digitally deliverable. For example- logo designs, business card design, websites, application developments, game development, testing.AdvantagesYou can earn way more than your job salary in some criteria!You are a business person in this case and you are independent.You can choose to work at your favorite service.In some cases, You don’t need certifications/degrees.You can get the experience of working with many people.You can work how much you want and you will learn a lot from this.DisadvantagesYou have to be more persistent. Because it’s very hard if you are just starting.For 6–7 months, you have to support your income with other side jobs. But there can be exceptions.You won’t get extra money like vacation money, health insurance, holidays will depend on you.It’s easy to take holidays as there is none to boss you around. But it can harm your productivity because sometimes, You get careless!You can fall into the wrong routes if you don’t receive roadmaps. For example- difficulty in pricing your services or choosing the right category.how to startYou can contact people directly and give them your business cards.You can showcase your services in magazines or some websites.You can start on freelance Job sites. For example- Upwork, Fiverr, Freelancer, PeoplePerHour (I didn’t stay for long in these websites, So I can’t really recommend these)You can create your own Website where people can see your details and contact. (Recommended)Why and when You shouldn’t try freelance job sites?You will not receive good cash when you are new.You don’t have the control of the communication. You can’t contact outside websites and you also have some other restrictions.You will rarely receive very big, high-paying clients. But the medium clients will be the source of big money because you will have multiple clients per month.4. You must also have another alternative place to provide service. Because you can get banned from 1 website in some cases.(This was my and some other freelancers’ opinion only. It’s your choice!)What you should do now?If you found these 4 ideas good, you should take one right now. Also, you can check other ideas from other sources.If you get confused, You should try all these 4 ideas and then check which fits you perfectly.But, Let me give you a piece of big and very important advice. Whatever idea you pick, You should always do some article/blog writing stuff. It’s very powerful. It can promote your service, business and it can even evolve a standalone business.Again, I am a web designer and web developer, So you can also contact me on freelancersami123@gmail.com to get a website.Thank you very much for reading this far, buddy!Sami Ibn ShafiWritten bySami Ibn ShafiLoves to discover things, Web designer, Developer & EntrepreneurFollow1 1 1 Work From HomeFreelancingBusinessEntrepreneurshipWeb DevelopmentMore from Sami Ibn ShafiFollowLoves to discover things, Web designer, Developer & EntrepreneurMore From MediumShould You Reduce Your Rate for Steady Work? — About Freelance WritingAnne WaymanHow to Get Your First Writing Job on UpworkZak Kann in The StartupHow to Make the Most of Your First Freelance ProjectLizzie DaveyAre Your Assumptions Hurting Your Freelance Writing Business?Meg Stewart in Freelance FilterHow Saying No Will Make You a More Successful WriterJason McBride in Escape Motivation15 Ways You May Be Wired to #Fail as a Digital NomadMilli Thornton 💓6 Ways to Ensure You Can Switch Off and Relax as a FreelancerKatie Weisz in The InnovationHow to set (reasonable) goals as a freelancerImari Scarbrough in The StartupAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
JavaScript Unit Test Best Practices — Test Data and Logic,https://medium.com/dev-genius/javascript-unit-test-best-practices-test-data-and-logic-43258a4410e5?source=tag_archive---------18-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Randy Bayne on UnsplashUnit tests are very useful for checking how our app is working.Otherwise, we run into all kinds of issues later on.In this article, we’ll look at some best practices we should follow when writing JavaScript unit tests.Test Middlewares in IsolationWe should test middleware in isolation so that we can test the critical parts of our app.Middlewares are used by everything, so we should test them.Since they’re functions, we can test them in isolation.We can just invoke it directly.Also, we can use node-mock-http to spy on the behavior of the middleware.We can write:const unitUnderTest = require(""./middleware"");const httpMocks = require(""node-mocks-http"");test(""should return http status 403 when request header is empty"", () => {  const request = httpMocks.createRequest({    method: ""GET"",    url: ""/user/1"",    headers: {      authentication: """"    }  });  const response = httpMocks.createResponse();  unitUnderTest(request, response);  expect(response.statusCode).toBe(403);});We use the node-mocks-http to make our requests.Then we can pass the request and response objects into our middleware.And then get the response.Measure and Refactor Using Static Analysis ToolsWe should use static analysis tools to improve our code quality and keep our code maintainable.It’s useful for detecting duplication, code complexity, and other issues.We can use tools like Sonarqube and Code Climate to check the statically analyze our app.Check Our Readiness for Node-Related ChaosWe should also check for issues like when the server or a process dies, or when memory is overloaded.Speed issues are also important to check.To regularly free up resources, we can use tools to regularly kill our app instances.We can do performance testing to find those issues.APM tools will also help us find them.Avoid Global Test Fixtures and SeedsGlobal test fixtures aren’t good since they’re shared between multiple tests.We don’t want to share them between multiple tests since we want independent tests.Tests shouldn’t start with data that have been manipulated by other pieces of code.Therefore, we should reset the data after each test so that we can always test with clean data.Our tests should be able to run in any order and still give us the same results.They also keep our tests simple since they’ll be easier to trace.For instance, we write something like:it(""should return true if we can log in with valid username and password"", async () => {  const username = 'james';  const password = 'password';  await addUser({ username, password });  const result = login(username, password);  expect(result).to.be(true);});We create a new user and then use that to log in so that we know the user that we’re testing with exists.Frontend TestingFront end testing is also important.Separate UI from FunctionalityWe should test UI separately from functionality.When we’re testing component logic, then UI becomes the noise that should be extracted.This way, our tests can focus on only manipulating data.UI can be tested separately.We can disable animation and only check data in tests.Photo by Gemma Evans on UnsplashConclusionWe can separate our logic tests with our UI tests.Also, we test middleware in isolation.Data should also be created from scratch for each test.Dev GeniusCoding, Tutorials, News, UX, UI and much more related to developmentFollow119 Sign up for Best StoriesBy Dev GeniusThe best stories sent monthly to your email. Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

11 Visual Studio Code Plugins for Better Development,https://medium.com/weekly-webtips/11-visual-studio-code-plugins-for-better-development-78ec16d028b2?source=tag_archive---------19-----------------------,"Visual Studio,Extension,Plugins,Web Development,Vscode Extension","VS Code EditorVisual Studio Code (VS Code) is a free source-code editor made by Microsoft. It is refined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud-based applications. Installing a plugin/extension to VS Code allows you to add languages, themes, debuggers, and tools to support your development workflow.Earlier I developed my application using Sublime text editor but later I switched to VS Code editor. My experience so far in using the VS Code has been very positive. I found lots of good plugins that helped me improve productivity, quality, readability, and maintainability of my source code. There are many different types of plugins available.Every programmer will have their own preference of plugin to use based on what area are they focussing to improve on.Below are some plugins which I recommend you give it a try.1.) GitlensGitLensVery powerful plugin. Allows you to view code authorship, blame, recent changes directly on VS Code editor. Can be integrated with JIRA, trello, slack. This is the most commonly used plugin.2.) JavaScript (ES6) Code SnippetsJavascript ES6 code snippetsThis extension contains code snippets for javascript in modern es6 syntax. (Snippet is a programming term for small portion of re-usable set of code).You can try the following handy commands:req: require package to const const packagename = require (‘packagename’)mde: default module.exports exports module.exports = { };fre: forEach loop in ES6 syntax array.forEach(currentItem => { })nfn: creates a named function const add = (params) => {}clg: console log object with name console.log(object)3.) Quokka.jsQuokka.jsIt is a rapid prototyping playground in your editor. Runtime values are updated and displayed in your IDE as you type. It compiles and executes your code immediately displaying results or error.For some, it could be a distraction, but for me, it really helped writing quality code.4.) ESLintESLintCannot emphasize how important it is to format and document your code. Not only it increased code maintainability but also easier for any other developer to read and understand the logic behind. ESlint helps to auto-format your code.This extension uses the config in the local folder version. If it is not found then looks into the globally installed version.5.) Rest ClientRest ClientThis extension allows you to send HTTP request and view the response in VS Code directly. IT supports options like GET/POST, cURL commands as well as GraphQL.Although I personally like to use postman for testing all API’s but this option is also not that bad to try.6.) Bracket Pair ColorizerBracket Pair ColorizerAs the name suggests, it allows matching brackets to be identified with colors.If you have just started developing than I highly recommend using this extension.7.) Better CommentsBetter CommentsThe Better Comments extension will help you create more human-friendly comments in your code. With this extension you will be able to categorise your annotations into diffract sections as below:AlertsQueriesTODOHighlightsAny commented code8.) NPM IntellisenseNPM IntellisenseThe Better Comments extension will help you create more human-friendly comments in your code. With this extension, you will be able to categorize your annotations into diffract sections as below9.) View Node PackageView Node PackageThis extension allows you to instantly switch from VS Code to the repository or documentation of the respective package.10.) DOTENVDotEnvThis extension supports syntax highlighting for environment settings (.env) files11.) Debugger for ChromeWorks on the web application running locally on your machine via VS studio. This extension operates in 2 modes — it can launch a new instance of chrome or it can attach to the running instance of Chrome. Additionally, you can set breakpoints, watches, and see console logs that are set while executing each step of your code.Thank you for reading this article.

Understanding React,https://medium.com/dev-genius/understanding-react-469e1ac3127d?source=tag_archive---------21-----------------------,"React,JavaScript,Web Development,App Development,React Hook","Starting with the background detailsReact is a JavaScript library that aims to simplify the development of visual interfaces. Developed at Facebook and released to the world in 2013, it drives some of the most widely used code in the world, powering many software companies.A Big MisconceptionReact is a JavaScript “library”. It is not exactly a “framework”. It is not a complete solution and you will often need to use more libraries with React to form any solution. React does not assume anything about the other parts in any solution.Frameworks serve a great purpose, especially for young teams and startups. When working with a framework, many smart design decisions are already made for you, which gives you a clear path to focus on writing good application-level logic. However, frameworks come with some disadvantages. For experienced developers working on large code bases, these disadvantages are sometimes a deal breaker.Frameworks are not flexible, although some claim to be. A framework usually wants you to code everything a certain way. If you try to deviate from that way, the framework usually ends up fighting you about it. Frameworks are also usually large and full of features. If you need to use only a small piece of them, you have to include the whole thing anyway. Admittedly, this point is changing today but it is still not ideal.Let’s Get Started with the FundamentalsSnippetFor VS Code users, here are some useful snippets:Extension Name : ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippetsrce -> Creates a Class based componentrfce -> Creates a Functional componentrconst -> Creates the constructor for the classThere are a lot other extension out there, the these are the one which is used most frequently.Lifecycle MethodsMountingWhen an instance of component is created or inserted into the DOMconstructorstatic getDerivedStateFromPropsrendercomponentDidMountUpgradingWhen a component is being re-rendered as a result of change to either it’s props or state.static shouldComponentUpdateshouldComponentMountrendergetSnapBeforeUpdatecomponentDidUpdateUnmountingWhen the component is being removed from the DOMcomponentWillUnmountError handlingWhen there is an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in a constructor of a child componentstatic getDerivedStateFromErrorcomponentDidCatchFragmentsA common pattern in React is for a component to return multiple elements. Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOPure ComponentPure component only re-renders the class component when there is a shallow comparison of props and state. This results in a performance improvement. It works only with class based components.MemoIt is a higher order component. What pure component is to class based component ,memo is to functional componentsRefsRefs makes it possible to access DOM nodes in React. There are two valid approaches are:-React.createRef() methodCallback method.Refs can be used with both functional and class component. Refs can also be passed from a parent component to the child component.Forwarding Ref: Refs can also be forwarded from the parent compoonent to native input component using forwardRef(native component, ref) method. Basically the child component receives the ref from the parent component and attaches it to the native input element.PortalsReact portals provide a way to render children into a Dom node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component. It provides the ability the break out of the DOM Tree. It uses a function ReactDOM.createPortal(JSX, id).Portal behave like a React child. We need of Portals to deal with child-parent CSSError BoundaryError Boundary are React Component that catch JavaScript errors in the child component tree, log these errors, and display the fallback UI A Class Component that implements either one or both of the lifecycle methods getDerivedStateFromError and componentDidCatch becomes an error boundary.getDerivedStateFromError: This is a static method that is used to render the fallback UI after an error is thrown.componentDidCatch: This is a method which is used to log the error message.Error Boundary catch error during rendering in lifecycle methods and in the constructor of the whole tree below them, however, they do not catch errors inside event handlersHigher Order Component — HOCA pattern where a function takes a component as an argument and returns a new enhanced component. It shares common properties within the components without having to repeat the code.const newComponent = higherOrderComponent( originalComponent )Non-technical example: const Ironman = withSuit( TonyStark )It is a nice little pattern that can be used to share common functionality between React Components.Render PropsThe term “render prop” refers to a technique for sharing code between React Component using a prop whose value is a function.React ContextContext provide a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at each level.It mainly includes three steps:Create a context — Using createContext() method and export provider and consumer component as well.Provide a context value — At top level, include provider component and pass the value using value attribute.Consume the context value — Use consumer component and pass a function as a childDiving into HooksHooks is a new feature in React 16.8 which allows you to use React features without having to write a class. Conceptually, React components have always been closer to functions. Hooks embrace functions, but without sacrificing the practical spirit of React. Hooks provide access to imperative escape hatches and don’t require you to learn complex functional or reactive programming techniques.Why Hooks?Problem-1Understanding how this keyword works in JavaScriptRemember to bind event handlers in class ComponentsClasses don’t minify very well and make hot reloading very unreliable.Problem-2There is no particular way to reuse stateful compomnent LogicHOC and render prop pattern do address this problem but it makes the code harder to follow.There is need to share stateful logic in a better wayProblem-3When creating component for complex scenarios, the related code is not organised in one placeRules of HooksPoints to keep in mind when dealing with hooksOnly call hooks at the top level. Don’t call hooks inside loop, conditions or nested functions.Only call hooks from React functions. Don’t call hooks inside any regular JavaScript function.Types of Hooks1 — useStateuseState hook lets you add state in functional componentIn classes the state is always an objectWith useState hook, state does not have to be an objectNew state depends on the previous state values>_ useEffectThe Effect Hook lets you perform side effect in functional ComponentIt is a close replacement for componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate and ComponentWillUnmount>_ useContextContext provide a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level>_ useReducerIt is a hook used for State Management. It is an alternative for useState. It is a more primitive hook than useState.>_ useCallbackIs is a hook that will return a memorized version of the callback function that only changes if one of the dependencies has changed.It is useful when passing callback to optimize child components that rely on reference equality to prevent the unnecessary re-renders.{ reference equality is checking if the functions are equal or not. }>_ useMemoYou may rely on useMemo as a performance optimization, not as a semantic guarantee. In the future, React may choose to “forget” some previously memorized values and recalculate them on next render, e.g. to free memory for off screen components.Difference between useCallback and useMemouseCallback caches the provided function instance itself, whereas useMemo invokes the provided function and catches its result. So if you need to cache a function use the useCallback hook, and if you need to cache the results of a function use the useMemo hook.>_ useRefCommonly used to focus the input fields. Altogether, it can be used to create a generic container which can hold a mutable value similar to instance properties of a class components. This generic container does not cause re-renders when the data it stores changes. At the same time it also remembers the stored data in after other state variable cause a re-render of this component.The above hooks are used in most of the cases, apart from these there are three more hooks:-useImperitiveHandleuseLayoutEffectuseDebugValueBonus Topic — Data FetchingAxios is a lightweight HTTP client based on the HTTP service and is similar to the native JavaScript Fetch API. Axios is promise-based, which gives you the ability to take advantage of JavaScript’s async and await for more readable asynchronous code.npm install axiosUsing Axios and useEffect to fetch data in ReactUsing Axios and useReducer to fetch data in ReactConclusionThis article should have given you a good introduction to to the Key concepts of React Js. There is much more to learn and improve, but I hope you feel confident delving in and playing around with react yourself now.If you are confused at some point and need a roadmap to study React, then you can refer the below mentioned article.A practical road-map for React developmentIn this short, to the point article, I’ll be guiding you through the complete process of learning React and becoming…codeburst.ioPlease let me know if anything was unclear, or if there’s anything else you’d like to see in this or a subsequent article.

"<strong class=""cc"">JavaScript: Who Is This?</strong>",https://medium.com/swlh/javascript-who-is-this-4fa9e8116eb6?source=tag_archive---------22-----------------------,"JavaScript,Software Development,Coding,Programming,Web Development","Who or what is this in JavaScript? It depends on how you’re using it but first let’s talk about what it is. this is a keyword in JavaScript. Think of this as a keyword to refer to the object in context. What does that mean? Think about this sentence. John is going to buy coffee because he ran out of coffee at home. Think about the use of the pronoun he. You could technically write “John is going out to buy coffee because John ran out of coffee at home.” Although the second sentence isn’t grammatically incorrect, you probably wouldn’t write a sentence like that.So how would we use this in our code? Look at the example below!var person = { name: ‘Jonathan’}console.log(this.name + ‘is going out to buy coffee because he forgot’)console.log(person.name + ‘is going out to buy coffee because he forgot’)Either console log works!So you may be thinking to yourself, this does fit better contextually in our code but does it go beyond that? Well yes, it actually does! Because of how this works, its contextual placement is very important. What do I mean? Think about the example I used before, John is going out to buy coffee because he ran out of coffee at home. You know the pronoun is referring to John because of the context of the pronoun. What if John was going to buy coffee for another person named John? Although it seems unlikely, this also leaves no question for which object is referred to. this also contains the value of the object in reference so it helps even more.Let’s now talk about the context of how this is used. this always refers to an object in hand. What do I mean? If you were to place this inside a function, it would refer to the function. It was used in the global scope, it would refer to the entire window object. For example, try typing this in your Developer Tools in your browser. The entire window object gets returned!ConclusionIn summation, this helps us not only because it reads better but also because it leaves no ambiguity for those who read our code (ourselves included) to whatever object is being referred to.

Currency conversion feature made easy with Ruby Gems.,https://medium.com/@phil.antiporda21/currency-conversion-feature-made-easy-with-ruby-gems-88bbb4232273?source=tag_archive---------23-----------------------,"Ruby,Ruby on Rails,Rubygems,Web Development","This guide assumes Ruby Fundamental knowledge including, but not limited to, installing and requiring ruby gems.I recently created an app that hopes to cater the aviation industry globally. It takes advantage of the biggest platform to date: the world wide web, to connect businesses, no matter how big or small. It does so by letting businesses post listings and their prices within the app for other businesses to see.With the app’s global aim, it is only reasonable to include every currency (or at least hope to) for trade. In some cases, there would be a business who’s trading from one currency and an interested party trading on another. Including a currency conversion feature within the app would improve user experience as they won’t have to leave the app to achieve results, hence I came up with this idea.Implementing this feature was nerve-racking and at the same time a pretty fun experience. This guide would hopefully just leave you with the ‘fun experience’ and none of the nerve-racking part. Let’s get started!populating a variable with possible currency codes with currencies gemFirst, we’re gonna have to come up with a list of all potential currencies our users might have. We do this by using the currencies gem. What we’re doing here is essentially calling the currencies method on the Currency Class to return a hash that has an array of all the information regarding a currency. We then map through this hash to extract the currency code, which coincidentally is the first element in the said array. We would then have a variable all_currencies that, as the name suggests, contains all the currency code from the Currency Class.The variable all_currencies would be our ‘library’ that contains all the currency code to present to our users as a selection. Data from this library would be the source of our ‘from this currency’ and ‘to this currency’ which we’ll get to in the next step.actual currency conversion with eu_central_bank gem and money gemThe next step is where the actual currency conversion would happen. We do this by using the money gem and the eu_central_bank gem. Using the EU Central Bank gem would remove the need to manually add exchange rates as you would with normal money gem use. The update_rates does that job by downloading the rates straight from the EU Central Bank. We then set eu_bank as the default bank for the Money Class.To use this feature, we first have to create an instance of the money class and specify the amount and the currency. We then call the method exchange_to with the desired currency to achieve the desired result. This would return a Money Instance of the result and to convert that result to an integer that we can show to our users, we call the fractional method.dynamic amount, currency from and currency toRemember that array of all_currencies that we have from the first step? Yeah, that’s one of the key ingredients to this feature to make it dynamic. We can essentially choose a currency to convert ‘from’ and ‘to’ from that array of currencies we have. We can even have the amount dynamic! In theory, we can let our users choose a currency to convert from and to as well as the amount, and presto! We would have our converted value!Disclaimer: Currencies chosen to convert from and to must be supported by EU Central Bank to avoid bugs. Unsupported currencies would produce nil bank exchange rates thus, errors.So there you have it!In three simple steps, you can now implement a dynamic currency conversion feature within your app! I’m sure the usage of the gems mentioned in this article are just the tip of the iceberg with regards to each gem’s features so feel free to explore more!In my next article, I’m gonna show you how I implemented this logic/feature within my Rails app to show results to users in real-time with the help of Stimulus Reflex.Currency Conversion feature within a Rails App.Written byPhil AntipordaLearning how to code, one missing ; at a time!Follow27 1 27 27 1 RubyRuby on RailsRubygemsWeb DevelopmentMore from Phil AntipordaFollowLearning how to code, one missing ; at a time!More From MediumSetting up PyCUDA on Ubuntu 18.04 for GPU programming with PythonRajneesh Aggarwal in leadkaroHunting memory leaks at Criteo scaleDimitri Bouron in Criteo R&D BlogWeb-Development Roadmap For BeginnersAnn Adaya in Better ProgrammingThe advantages of Document Markup Languages vs WYSIWYG editorsChristian Neumanns in freeCodeCamp.orgAPI-First Development and OpenAPICasey Lutz in Trimble MAPS Engineering BlogOOP Four Principles Explained In Five MinutesPetey in The Startup🐍 How to Use Python ListsMikio Harman in The StartupHow to use AWS CodeBuild as a CI for your Python projectGuillaume Androz in The StartupAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Creating Magic-8 Ball game with React Hooks,https://medium.com/@aneesa.farook.sait/creating-magic-8-ball-game-with-react-hooks-e4ea0e0c3ad3?source=tag_archive---------24-----------------------,"Reactjs,Hooks State,HTML,Web Development,Magic 8 Ball","The Magic 8-Ball is a plastic sphere, made to look like an eight-ball, that is used for seeking advice. It was invented in 1950 and is currently manufactured by Mattel. The user asks a question to the ball and then turns it over to reveal an answer in a window on the ball.In that tutorial, you are going to discover how to create your own Magic 8 Ball with ReactJS. React is a modular Javascript library created by Facebook which helps to make web apps fast and efficient with minimal coding. Hooks are functions that give you React features like state and lifecycle hooks without ES6 classes.Getting StartedCreating the structure of the pageThe first step is to create the structure of the page for the Magic 8-Ball. Here’s the starting code./// App.jsfunction App() {return (<div className=""App"">      <h1>Welcome to ask Magic 8-ball</h1>      <p className=""info"">Ask a question and tap me for an answer...</p>      <input type=""text"" className=""question""/>      <div className=""eight-ball"">        <div className=""content"">        <p className=""error""></p>         <p className=""answer""></p>        <p className=""eight"">8</p>        </div>      </div></div>)}We have an outer div tag with class name, App to center the content. Followed by the div tag, we have a h1 tag for our title and a p tag for information . Then an input tag for the user to ask their questions. To display the magic 8-ball, we have two div tags. Nested within the div tag we have three p tags to display the error, answer and the number 8.CSS for stylingCSS for the structure of our page.Setting Initial State in a Component using useState/// App.jsconst [userInput, setUserInput] = useState('');const [randomIndex, setRandomIndex] = useState('');const [error, setError] = useState('');useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components. It takes takes the initial state as an argument and returns an array with two items. The first item is a variable containing the state. The second item in the array is a function that will update the state.Input with onChange method/// App.jsconst handleChange = (event) => {event.preventDefault();console.log(event.target.value);setUserInput(event.target.value);}      <input type=""text"" className=""question"" value={userInput} onChange={handleChange} />      First, create a method called handleChange that has a parameter called event. When the method is called, it receives an event object that contains text from the input element. You can access this string using event.target.value. Update the userInput using setUserInput. Using this handleChange method we are setting out user’s question to userInput property of our state.Adding the onClick() handler to the Magic 8-ball/// App.jsconst handleClick = () => {if(userInput){setError('')setRandomIndex(Math.round(Math.random() * 20));setUserInput('');}else{setError('Enter a question to know the answer!')}} const possibleAnswers = ['It is certain','It is decidedly so','Without a doubt','Yes, definitely','You may rely on it','As I see it, yes','Outlook good','Yes','Signs point to yes','Reply hazy try again','Ask again later','Better not tell you now','Cannot predict now','Concentrate and ask again','Don\'t count on it','My reply is no','My sources say no','Most likely','Outlook not so good','Very doubtful'];<div className=""content"" onClick={handleClick}>{error ? <p className=""error"">{error}</p> :answer ? <p className=""answer"">{answer}</p> : <p className=""eight"">8</p>}</div>The onClick() handler is triggered when the ball is clicked and runs the handleClick method defined in the App component. In the handleClick method, we check for the user input. If we find the userInput, we display the answer by generating a random number using Math.random() method and using the random index to choose the answer from the predefined possibleAnswers array. Else, We display an error message.This is how our components should look like now:Now, It is your turn to try! >^..^<Written byAneesa Farook SaitFollowReactjsHooks StateHTMLWeb DevelopmentMagic 8 BallMore from Aneesa Farook SaitFollowMore From MediumHow ActionScript foreshadowed TypeScriptGary Nelson in JavaScript In Plain EnglishTeaching to learn: Daily TemperaturesShane Quick in The StartupBuild a GraphQL app with HasuraSathishravi in JavaScript In Plain EnglishReact as a Framework Part 2: PropsLucio GonzalezReact Native Overlapping ComponentsKarthik Balasubramanian in TimelessBuild your own React toast notifications from scratchAshrith Reddy in JavaScript In Plain EnglishThe Window & Document Object In JavaScript — 7 Useful Things You Can Do With ThemLouis Petrik in JavaScript In Plain EnglishExecution context and the call stack — visually illustrated by a slice of tasty cakeJavaScript TeacherAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

Career Change After 25 Years,https://medium.com/@Richard_A_Brown/career-change-4ea955ae156e?source=tag_archive---------26-----------------------,"Careers,Web Development,Learning","Recently, my long time contract working for the Federal government came to an end. I spent almost three years prototyping Chatbots, Cloud computing, and Robotic Process Automation applications. I made a lot of money and I worked from home.I didn’t relish the thought of a new job/contract search. My wife doesn’t drive anymore and has some health issues, pretty much requiring me to keep working from home. I spent over 25 years creating web applications for government and commercial businesses and another 10 years before that doing the same for the Federal government. I figured with all of that experience it wouldn’t be that difficult building a small business.The first thing I discovered was that my ‘target’ audience wasn’t really in need of web applications but web sites and landing pages. I discovered that somewhere between 30 and 40% of all websites use WordPress. I never used WordPress.I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript and a compiler called Svelte to make components. Svelte creates small, fast web sites; however, they take some time to make. WordPress web sites don’t take much time comparatively speaking.My marketing experience was virtually non-existent so I checked out some freelancing sites, Upwork and Freelancer being the biggest. I thought I would use them for my marketing to get my business off the ground. Freelancer has very low pricing and, as a result, very low prices. Upwork has better pricing than Freelancer but they take a larger share of the money. I look at Freelancer but I rarely put in a bid.I decided to go with Upwork since they cater to U.S. workers. The first thing I saw is that most of the jobs are for WordPress and the pricing for most is pretty low. The other thing is that most of the jobs are looking for portfolios and experience with WordPress. I had none.I put up a couple of example sites for a portfolio. Something, but they had nothing to do with WordPress. I added some testimonials that I had acquired over the years.I spent the next two months taking WordPress video courses and working on WordPress web sites for family businesses for free. I don’t need the money yet. I did get two small jobs on Upwork that weren’t related to WordPress. I made a net of $650 for the two months. I check Upwork and Freelancer two or three times a day looking for jobs.I spent time setting up a local development environment for WordPress. Working on the host server is not good. My local environment lets me set up multiple, separate WordPress platforms to do work and testing. I guess I need to do a plug for LocalWP.com. I have no affiliation with them but they have a great platform.I finished my business web site this morning and moved it to my hosting company. WordPress has plugins for everything. I was able to install a plugin for free that allowed me to export my site from my development environment and then import it to the host. I used several pieces of custom programming but everything moved with few issues. The issues were my fault.I’m still working on a website for my daughter’s Spa and a legal site for my granddaughter’s law firm.I’ll let you know how my journey progresses.RichWritten byRich BrownFreelancer.

How to Track User Activity of Sign in and out,https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-to-track-user-activity-of-sign-in-and-out-d7720d58e283?source=tag_archive---------27-----------------------,"Python,Django,Design Patterns,Web Development","Have you thought about how much users like your website? How often do they log in? What’s the favorite time window they use your website? These million-dollar questions are big deals to business. The activity of sign in/out seems to be the most reliable data to answer them. In this tutorial, I am going to walk you through how to track these data in Django.After comparing and trying a few different approaches for years, here comes to my best solution, that is Django signal which is a common design pattern: Observer Pattern. After architecting many Django projects, I noticed that signal is a quite handy tool to help decouples app dependencies and make codebase easy to maintain. Don’t get me wrong. Signal is a double-edge sword. We need to wisely plan before we act. And this is a perfect case.Goal:Log activity of sign in/out by using Django signal. In this tutorial, I am going to print activities in console.Dependencies:1. Python 3.62. Django 2.2.14Step 1/3Create signals.py file in an app. I suggest you add it in an app that has something to do with accounts. For example, I am going to add it in home app.Then write the following codes. Notice that Django provides default auth signals, user_logged_in, user_logged_out, and user_login_failed. All we need to do is to build receiver per each signal.from django.dispatch import receiverfrom django.contrib.auth.signals import user_logged_in, user_logged_out, user_login_failed  @receiver(user_logged_in)def log_user_login(sender, request, user, **kwargs):    print('user logged in')  @receiver(user_login_failed)def log_user_login_failed(sender, credentials, request, **kwargs):    print('user logged in failed')  @receiver(user_logged_out)def log_user_logout(sender, request, user, **kwargs):    print('user logged out')Step 2/3In apps.py, register signals.py by writing the code below.from django.apps import AppConfig  class HomeConfig(AppConfig):    name = 'home'     def ready(self):        import home.signalsAt this point, we have everything ready. Start project and we should see log printed in console after you sign in, sign out or fail to sign in.Step 3/3Let’s take one step further to log activity in a more informative way. We will track who the user is and through which page he performs sign-in/out action.from django.dispatch import receiverfrom django.contrib.auth.signals import user_logged_in, user_logged_out, user_login_failed  @receiver(user_logged_in)def log_user_login(sender, request, user, **kwargs):    print('user {} logged in through page {}'.format(user.username, request.META.get('HTTP_REFERER')))  @receiver(user_login_failed)def log_user_login_failed(sender, credentials, request, **kwargs):    print('user {} logged in failed through page {}'.format(credentials.get('username'), request.META.get('HTTP_REFERER')))  @receiver(user_logged_out)def log_user_logout(sender, request, user, **kwargs):    print('user {} logged out through page {}'.format(user.username, request.META.get('HTTP_REFERER')))You should see prints below.There are a couple of ways to store data. In this tutorial, we just print it in console. The most common way is to write them into a log file through Django logging. In order to maintain data for a long term, you can insert them in database table or send them through data pipeline like Kafka. Please leave your comments if you would like to know how to process data. I will make another tutorial on that.In case you are interested in the real project, I shared it on Github here. https://github.com/slow999/DjangoAndTrackSignInOut .

"My New Favorite Language is Ruby, and it RULES!",https://medium.com/@tropila04/my-new-favorite-language-is-ruby-and-it-rules-d00b147656f3?source=tag_archive---------28-----------------------,"Ruby,Programming,Bootcamp,Object Oriented,Web Development","During the unprecedented events of the Covid-19, I took a leap of faith and decided to further my programming knowledge by learning a new language. I applied and was accepted into a fully funded boot camp program at Flatiron School. My cohort is almost 2 months deep with Ruby, and I have fallen in love! The simplicity, productivity and power behind Ruby has really made this journey to becoming a Software Engineer enjoyable and fun. I want to share this love for Ruby by showing a few reasons why I believe Ruby Rules!Ruby Rules Because…Reason 1-Ruby is an Object Oriented programming language. Meaning, it can transform real life ideas or nouns into objects and create dynamic applications for the world to see! These objects, also referred to as Models, can store their own attributes and actions (methods), that can be used by Programmers to create some really powerful applications. Objects are an abstraction of thought. Did you know human language is also an abstract system!“An object-oriented approach to application development makes programs more intuitive to design, faster to develop, more amenable to modification, and easier to understand.” — Object-Oriented Programming with Objective-C, Apple Inc.Above is an example of writing out a class in Ruby. A class is a blueprint of an object. In this example, there is a Plant object that contains attributes and implementation of behaviors(methods). Now imagine you want to create a gardening application that displays information about plants and how to garden. Along with this Plant class, we could also create a Garden class. In this class we could write out definitions to display to a user how to garden a specific plant. There are so many different possibilities and directions we could write out this application. Ruby makes the process of writing our app easier by using Object Oriented design to keep your thoughts organized and your code readable.Reason 2-One of my favorite quotes that my instructor at Flatiron keeps repeating is- “Ruby has your back” -Sylwia Vargas(Lead Instructor), and she isn’t lying! Ruby is a perfect language for beginners. I first started my journey as a programmer with Java which is a statically typed language. Ruby is a dynamically typed language which means it is less strict and you can write up a program faster.In the example above, you can see the power and leniency of Ruby! We can declare a variable and assign it a value in the same line AND we can forget about stressing over syntax errors with missing semi-colons! Another great example of how awesome Ruby is:Look at how much easier it is to read and understand the Ruby example than the Java! The same method can be written in one line of code. As a beginner learning to code for the first time, reading out loud 10-times-print ”Hello Ruby” will make more sense than trying to understand that scary for loop.Reason 3-Ruby is an open sourced language. This means that there are developers that are constantly improving the language making it easier and more efficient to use! One of my favorite things about Ruby is how many built in methods the language comes with. There are also an abundant amount of libraries that have been created by developers ready to install into your program as you please! You can read more about these libraries and their power here: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/libraries/Above is a built in method that you can call using the dot notation. .methods will list for you all the different methods that you can use on your class! This is one my favorite methods and I use it all the time while building out my applications.As you build out more complicated applications and start getting errors, you can hop into the console and use built in Ruby methods like .class and .methods to help you navigate your way to solving the error. As a programmer you will never remember every method and that is okay! By using Ruby’s built in methods, we can see what is available based on the class type, and then determine from there our next steps.Final Thoughts-I have only covered 3 powerful reasons why I believe Ruby rules but there are PLENTY more! Ruby is dynamic, readable, and has our back! As I dive deeper into the boot camp, I am excited to learn more magic that Ruby has and why Ruby is such a popular language.“I believe that the purpose of life is, at least in part, to be happy. Based on this belief, Ruby is designed to make programming not only easy but also fun. It allows you to concentrate on the creative side of programming, with less stress.”-Yukihiro Matsumoto (Creator of Ruby)Written byChristy TropilaStarted my journey as a Web Dev in 2018 and loving every minute of it! :)Follow401 1 401 401 1 RubyProgrammingBootcampObject OrientedWeb DevelopmentMore from Christy TropilaFollowStarted my journey as a Web Dev in 2018 and loving every minute of it! :)More From Medium4 Pillars of Object-Oriented BuildingBhavik Savaliya in The StartupA Beginner’s Guide to PythonMelissa Ann Mullen in simple CSCreating a Unique and Beautiful Presentation using R Programming LanguageRutvik Deshpande in The StartupCreating the Java ArrayList Data StructureDino Cajic in Dev Genius8 Great Ideas for Programming Projects That People Will UseFilipe Silva in Better ProgrammingBasic usage of Spark RDDs and Data frames.Ramesh GanesanTale of a MAGIC Engagementaka franklinXamarin vs React Native vs Flutter — What Is Best For Cross-platform DevelopmentSkywell Software in Data Driven InvestorAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Blog Entry #1,https://medium.com/cs373-fall-2020-jeffrey-moulckers/blog-entry-1-44a192d8f8cf?source=tag_archive---------29-----------------------,"Computer Science,Web Development,Software Engineering,The University Of Texas","Hello everyone, welcome to my first post in my semester-long blog for Software Engineering (CS 383) with Professor Glenn Downing. Here, I will share a bit about myself to kick off the semester and get you acquainted with my interests.My name is Jeffrey Moulckers, and I am a Computer Science and Iberian/Latin American Languages & Cultures dual major at the University of Texas at Austin. As a lifelong Austinite, I grew up enjoying everything there is to do in the city and surrounded myself with the culture, food, and music.Prior to attending UT Austin, I went to Westwood High School, where I involved myself heavily in the Warrior Marching Band as Drumline Captain and Band President. Outside of music, however, I earned the Eagle Scout rank and participated in P.R.O.S. — or PALs as it is more commonly known — in which I spent a great amount of time volunteering for students at surrounding schools.At UT Austin, I enjoy serving as Corporate Officer for the Hispanic Association of Computer Scientists (HACS), volunteering with Code Orange, and working as a web developer for a small number of clients. This year I look forward to seriously buffing up my web development skills in Software Engineering, as I find the field intriguing and exciting in its ability to adapt to virtually any industry.Enough about me, I have something I would love to share that I feel is ABSOLUTELY crucial to approaching web development for clients with non-technical backgrounds. This past summer, I built a website for the University Finance Association (UFA) at UT Austin, and I discovered the importance of using a Content Management System (CMS) to allow clients to easily dynamically change content without having to call up a web developer and change code. After endless hours of exploration and implementation, I found that Gatsby’s seamless integration with GraphQL allows one to dynamically pull data from a CMS — my favorite is Cosmic — to deliver virtually any type of content straight to a page. This gives an easy, object-oriented outlook to a client and their different types of data to send to their page.That’s it for this week, but I look forward to including many more tips and tricks in the future, as I am sure to stumble across more useful tools while implementing our SWE project.CS373 Fall 2020: Jeffrey MoulckersA series of updates and insightful summaries of my experience in Software Engineering (CS 373)FollowComputer ScienceWeb DevelopmentSoftware EngineeringThe University Of TexasWritten byJeffrey MoulckersFollowFollowCS373 Fall 2020: Jeffrey MoulckersFollowThis blog will encapsulate an overview of my experiences in Software Engineering (CS 373) with Professor Glenn Downing at the University of Texas at Austin.

23 Essential Links for Building a Well-Rounded Website,https://medium.com/@hybridcattt/building-a-well-rounded-website-essentials-822a27a46cad?source=tag_archive---------30-----------------------,"Web Development,Jamstack,Personal Web Site,Indieweb,Web","Photo by Crew on UnsplashThis is my curated collection of essential links useful for building a well-rounded website, regardless of the stack.I first learned the basics of web development in the 2000s. Since then, I have contributed to web applications code in my corporate jobs and worked with HTML&CSS in the context of ebooks. However the first real website I made and published from scratch was the first version of my personal site that I built two years ago. It was a single index.html with a static layout and very little content. The current version of my site and blog is built with a static site generator.During the last couple of years, I have accumulated a large collection of bookmarks that I find helpful when making websites. I regularly keep referring to many of them.All of these resources that I share here are relevant to most kinds of websites, regardless of what stack or framework you use. If you are building a website on your own, I hope this collection will prove to be useful.All links are from my personal collection. I have no affiliation with any of the linked resources. All linked resources are free to use.Page LayoutFlexboxTable-based layouts are a thing of the past, with Flexbox being the most common way to layout web UIs these days. A Complete Guide to Flexbox ended up being one of the resources I get back to the most.CSS SelectorsThere’s a lot of ways to apply styles to an element in CSS. I love the CSS selector reference from w3schools. It provides a short overview of each selector and lets me quickly choose the best option.HTML & AccessibilityWhile browsing Twitter one day I stumbled upon an article recommendation from @ReyTheDev for structuring HTML semantically to achieve low-effort accessibility and reader mode support. It’s a gold-mine when it comes to the basics of modern HTML.NavigationOpening external linksIt was a discovery that opening links in a new tab is unfriendly to accessibility and mobile usage. This is usually achieved with target=""_blank"" on links. I've never looked at it in such a way that the user can always opt-in to open something in a new tab, but they can never opt-out. UX Collective wrote a comprehensive article on opening links.SEOTo make a site searchable through search engines, it is essential to get several meta properties right. Shout out to @MarinaHuber for introducing me to this comprehensive SEO check tool. It checks not only the technical side, but also the content itself.Canonical URLs help avoid duplicate content on the web. They are useful even if you post only in one place. Check out rel=canonical: the ultimate guide.ArtIt’s hard to avoid needing graphic resources, even when building a simple website. There are many copyright-free collections out there, for example Unsplash, Undraw and Black Illustrations.FaviconsThe quickest way to get favicons is to use an online generator. favicon.io lets you make favicons from text, emojis, and images. For example, I made my favicon from the text “MG” — creative, right! Files will be ready-to-go along with a code snippet.Favicon checker is super handy for verifying that all favicons and manifests are in place.IconsSimple Icons has a comprehensive catalog of free SVG icons for popular brands.ColorsI’ve tried several color scheme generators before ending up with Coolors. You can pick a palette from a large catalog, modify or create your own, even based on an uploaded image.Social SharingButtonsTwitter’s sharing widget and similar components from other social networks have tracking embedded, so I opted out of using them. I am also avoiding using unnecessary cookies or any kind of local storage, so I wouldn’t have to show the infamous cookie banner.Social Media share buttons without javascript documents sharing links for many popular social apps and networks.Sharing button generator is a great starting point for rolling your own buttons. I had to tweak the CSS, but it was still easier than starting from scratch.Preview cardsMost social networks use Open Graph metadata to generate preview cards. Open Graph Protocol homepage gives a nice overview of the generic webpage properties and directions to dig deeper.Twitter has its own meta properties inspired by Open Graph. The main addition is that you can specify the style you want your cards to follow. Here’s the link to Twitter’s Documentation on Cards. Other social networks such as LinkedIn and Facebook rely on Open Graph protocol and don’t have their own properties sans rare exceptions.Testing preview cardsTesting preview cards is something that I did a lot of, making sure I like how my site looks when shared. I certainly did send messages to myself, nothing wrong with that :)Each of the major social networks has its own card validator, which lets you easily preview the cards. I only have Twitter Card Validator bookmarked, but here’s also LinkedIn Post Inspector and Facebook Sharing Debugger.Card metadata is heavily cached on the social network’s side, so they don’t have to hit your webpage every time someone is looking at a post with your link. Card validators have a hidden perk: they also invalidate the respective caches. This article goes in-depth on cards and caching: How to Clear Facebook Cache, Twitter Cache, and LinkedIn Cache so Your Content Looks Right.TrackingI care about privacy, so having Google Analytics on the previous version of my site was bugging me.

I’d looked at a few things online which sounded like good skills to have that were flexible and that could be done remotely. At first, I was jumping around the internet trying out different sites, youtube tutorial videos, coursera, and others I can’t recall. I never really got anywhere with these to start with but the programming things got me interested. But it wasn’t until I met a freeCodeCamp.org. It is a non-profit organization helping thousands of people learn how to code for free, from zero to become a Full Stack Developer.There are about ten or more certifications, but only six that you needed to get The Full Stack Development Certificate on freeCodeCamp, and they’ve laid them out the way they recommend going through them.This story captures my personal project’s solutions to the first curriculum ever, responsive web design projects. The fact that this is just like 0.00001/10 learning process and I still have a long wayyyyy to go, but as Mark Zuckerberg said :“But let me tell you a secret: no one does when they begin. Ideas don’t come out fully formed. They only become clear as you work on them. You just have to get started.”ProjectsThese projects are made for the freeCodeCamp.org Responsive Web Design Certification.

Top 7 most expected JS features in recent years,https://medium.com/dev-genius/top-7-most-expected-js-features-in-recent-years-54b8ef775182?source=tag_archive---------32-----------------------,"Js,JavaScript,Ecmascript,Programming,Web Development","Since the release of ECMAScript 2015, it has become more difficult to track new features in JS.And in this article, I want to talk about 7 features that the community expected the most.Lets dive in!1. Dynamic importThis function adds an import(specifier) syntactic form, which acts in many ways like a function (but see below). It returns a promise for the module namespace object of the requested module, which is created after fetching, instantiating, and evaluating all of the module's dependencies, as well as the module itself.Here you can see how import() enables lazy-loading modules upon navigation in a very simple single-page application:import() can be used from scripts, not just from modules.If import() is used in a module, it can occur anywhere at any level, and is not hoisted.import() accepts arbitrary strings (with runtime-determined template strings shown here), not just static string literals.The presence of import() in the module does not establish a dependency which must be fetched and evaluated before the containing module is evaluated.Read more: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import2. Async FunctionsThere’s a special syntax to work with promises in a more comfortable fashion, called “async/await”. The word “async” before a function means one simple thing: a function always returns a promise. Other values are wrapped in a resolved promise automatically. The keyword await makes JavaScript wait until that promise settles and returns its result.Error handlingIf a promise resolves normally, then await promise returns the result. But in the case of a rejection, it throws the error, just as if there were a throw statement. In real situations, the promise may take some time before it rejects. In that case there will be a delay before await throws an error. We can catch that error using try..catch, the same way as a regular throw:Read more: https://github.com/tc39/ecmascript-asyncawait3. Asynchronous IteratorsAsync iterators and async iterablesAn async iterator is much like an iterator, except that its next() method returns a promise for a { value, done } pair. As noted above, we must return a promise for the iterator result pair because both the next value and the ""done"" state of the iterator are potentially unknown at the time the iterator method returns.The async iteration statement: for-await-ofA variation of the for-of iteration statement is introduced which iterates over async iterable objects.Async generator functionsAsync generator functions are similar to generator functions, with the following differences:When called, async generator functions return an object, an async generator whose methods (next, throw, and return) return promises for { value, done }, instead of directly returning { value, done }. This automatically makes the returned async generator objects async iterators.await expressions and for-await-of statements are allowed.The behavior of yield* is modified to support delegation to async iterables.This function then returns an async generator object, which can be consumed with for-await-of as shown in the previous example.Read more: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-async-iteration4. Object Rest/Spread PropertiesECMAScript 6 introduces rest elements for array destructuring assignment and spread elements for array literals.This feature introduces analogous rest properties for object destructuring assignment and spread properties for object literals.Rest PropertiesRest properties collect the remaining own enumerable property keys that are not already picked off by the destructuring pattern. Those keys and their values are copied onto a new object.Spread PropertiesSpread properties in object initializers copies own enumerable properties from a provided object onto the newly created object.Read more: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-object-rest-spread5. Optional ChainingThe Optional Chaining operator is spelled ?.. It may appear in three positions:If the operand at the left-hand side of the ?. operator evaluates to undefined or null, the expression evaluates to undefined. Otherwise the targeted property access, method or function call is triggered normally.Read more: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-optional-chaining6. Nullish CoalescingIf the expression at the left-hand side of the ?? operator evaluates to undefined or null, its right-hand side is returned.Read more: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-nullish-coalescing7. BigIntBigInt is a primitive that provides a way to represent whole numbers larger than 253, which is the largest number Javascript can reliably represent with the Number primitiveSyntaxA BigInt is created by appending n to the end of the integer or by calling the constructor.OperatorsYou can use +, *, -, ** and % with BigInts, just like with Numbers.The / operator also work as expected with whole numbers. However, since these are BigInts and not BigDecimals, this operation will round towards 0, which is to say, it will not return any fractional digits.Comparisons and ConditionalsA BigInt is not strictly equal to a Number, but it is loosely so.Read more: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-bigintYou can read more about all new features since 2015 here https://github.com/tc39/proposals/blob/master/finished-proposals.mdP.S.

Berkenalan dengan React,https://medium.com/@fitrapujo/berkenalan-dengan-react-78b8fd2ccae0?source=tag_archive---------33-----------------------,"React,Web Development,JavaScript,Beginners Guide,Javascript Frameworks","Saya disini tidak menjelaskan mengenai sejarah dan track record React, karena saya rasa sudah banyak artikel yang membahas hal tersebut. Saya akan mencoba mengenalkan beberapa esensi dan kapabilitas React. karena ini adalah publikasi pertama saya di medium, untuk semua pembaca jika ada kritik dan saran boleh banget ditambahkan di kolom komentar, terimakasihReact Secara SederhanaReact adalah sebuah library dari bahasa pemrograman javascript yang dapat memudahkan kita dalam mengembangkan sebuah aplikasi berbasis website. Wah jadi semudah apa nih, gaperlu ngoding lagi? Eits, bukan gitu cara ya mainnya. Umumnya, pembuatan aplikasi berbasis web memiliki kebutuhan yang cukup kompleks, sehingga jika dibuat secara manual tanpa bantuan library seperti React akan membutuhkan waktu, tenaga dan pikiran yang lebih banyak lagi, puyeng deh developernya %$#!Untuk mereduksi kebutuhan waktu, tenaga dan pikiran yang dibutuhkan selama mengembangkan sebuah aplikasi, sebagian developer berinisiatif mengembangkan sebuah library ataupun framework, salah satunya adalah React. Nah, React disini menyediakan berbagai fitur dan template yang dapat digunakan developer untuk membuat aplikasi dengan lebih cepat, tesrtruktur dan konsisten.Apa saja sih kira-kira yang dapat dilakukan dengan React? Kok bisa membuat proses pengembangan lebih cepat dan mudah? Kita bahas satu persatu yaBongkar Pasang UI dengan KomponenDalam mengembangkan sebuah aplikasi web, sudah pasti ada banyak elemen aplikasi kita yang memiliki fungsionalitas dan tampilan yang mirip, contoh-nya seperti: tombol, form, header, navigasi, dsb. Dengan banyaknya elemen dengan fungsi dan tampilan yang mirip, otomatis akan banyak kode yang mirip juga di workspace kita, hal tersebut termasuk redundan dan kurang efisien. Untuk meningkatkan efisiensi pengembangan website, kita dapat membuat sebuah tempate untuk masing-masing elemen yang sama. Akan tetapi dalam implementasinya di HTML, CSS dan Javascript, melakukan hal seperti itu justru mempersulit proses pengembangan dan berujung pada waktu pengembangan yang lebih lama (CMIIW).Beruntungnya kita, React menyediakan fitur templating elemen yang mudah dan cepat untuk diimplementasikan, bahkan fitur ini menjadi salah satu fitur utama dari React, namanya komponen. Apasih komponen itu? seperti yang saya sebutkan tadi, komponen merupakan sebuah template yang berisi kode-kode Javascript (Ya, React full berbasis bahasa Javascript) yang nanti akan mengembalikan sebuah /sekumpulan elemen HTML.Komponen dapat digunakan secara berulang-ulang di berbagai sudut aplikasi tanpa menulis ulang kode dari awal, cukup menuliskan nama komponennya saja. Penerapan komponen di React cukup flexibel, jadi kita bisa membentuk dan membuat komponen sesuai dengan kebutuhan dan keinginan kita. Selain itu, dengan fleksibelnya sistem komponen pada React, kita dapat mengatur arstitektur aplikasi kita dengan lebih leluasa.Demo sederhana dari komponen di React — Sekali dibuat bisa dipakai berkali-kali tanpa menulis ulang kodeNah ada yang lebih menarik lagi nih dari React, masing-masing komponen yang kita buat di React dapat menerima data yang dapat mempengaruhi bagaimana komponen tersebut ditampilkan dan berfungsi loh, mantab kan! Untuk lebih jelasnya akan saya coba jelaskan di bagian berikutnya.Manipulasi Komponen dengan State dan PropsSeperti yang saya paparkan diatas, Komponen bisa menerima sekumpulan data, dengan data tersebut, kita dapat menentukan bagaimana Komponen di tampilkan dan berfungsi. Di dalam komponen ada 2 jenis data nih, yaitu props dan state. Props adalah data yang didapatkan komponen dari luar komponen tersebut, data props diberikan ketika Komponen dipanggil, dan bisa diakses di deklarasi komponen tersebut, untuk lebih jelasnya perhatikan video berikut yaDemo penggunaan props pada komponen React — penampilan sapaan sesuai dengan props name yang diberikan ketika Komponen dipanggilDilain sisi, state adalah data internal milik komponen, state dideklarasikan, diinisiasi dan diolah didalam sebuah komponen. State mempresentasikan bagian dari komponen yang dinamis (dapat berubah-ubah) karena dia dapat diubah secara langsung saat aplikasi sedang berjalan. Jadi, jika kita ingin komponen kita interaktif dan dinamis, kita perlu menerapkan state di aplikasi kita.Demo implementasi state pada komponen di React — Text sapaan akan berubah secara dinamis sesuai dengan nilai dari state text, dan nilai text berubah secara dinamis sesuai dengan nilai inputan pada formSekilas seperti itu konsep props dan state secara sederhana, karena post ini topiknya perkenalan terhadap React, saya tidak akan membahas terlalu dalam, hehe. Yuk lanjut ke fitur selanjutnya!Single Page Application (SPA)Waduh apalagi nih SPA? Secara singkat, SPA adalah model penyajian konten di browser tanpa berpindah-pindah halaman. Dengan SPA, Browser hanya akan memuat ulang konten yang perlu dimuat ulang saja (lihat demo dibawah), fitur ini jika digunakan dengan tepat, dapat meningkatkan pengalaman pengguna ketika menggunakan aplikasi kita. Model aplikasi web yang menerapkan model ini sering kalian gunakan loh, contohnya: Gmail, Facebook, Google Maps, Twitter (tambahin sendiri ya hehe..). Nah React disini telah menyediakan arsitektur dan fungsionalitas yang banyak untuk mengembangakan aplikasi web berbentuk SPA. Dengan begitu, pengembangan aplikasi web bermodel SPA dapat dilakukan dengan lebih mudah dan cepat.Contoh SPA — Ketika menekan tombol navigasi, halaman tidak berpindah dan hanya bagian tertentu saja yang di muat ulangNah itu tadi adalah beberapa dari esensi React library secara singkat. Sebenarnya masih banyak yang bisa dibahas dari React, tapi karena ini hanyalah sebuah perkenalan saja, jangan sampai kebanyakan ya! Bukannya makin sayang malah kabur semua karena pusing hehehe.Belajar adalah perjalanan panjang, jadi pakai cara marathon, step by step , bukan saling sprint berlomba mana yang tercepat, karena pada akhirnya adalah bukan siapa yang paling cepat tapi seberapa banyak ilmu yang membekas dan bermanfaat, take it slow~Setelah ini kita akan belajar mengenai bagaimana membuat project sederhana menggunakan React.

Laravel Auth Tips — Disable/Enable route pada Laravel Auth,https://medium.com/@akughoni/laravel-auth-tips-disable-enable-route-pada-laravel-auth-95a16cd6ca4c?source=tag_archive---------34-----------------------,"Laravel,Laravel Framework,Route,PHP,Web Development","Kita semua tahu, bahwa laravel adalah framework yang sangat-sangat powerfull. Laravel hadir dengan banyak sekali kemampuan yang dapat mempermudah proses pengembangan aplikasi kita. Salah satunya adalah Laravel Auth.Laravel menyediakan sebuah sistem authentication lengkap, mulai dari Login, Register, Lupa password, email konfirmasi, dll. Tanpa perlu kita membuat semua itu secara manual. Semua disediakan dengan package Laravel Auth.Tentunya kita sebagai developer perlu untuk mengetahui bagaimana cara kerja dari tools/library yang kita gunakan. kita perlu mengetahui bagaimana memanfaatkan library tersebut agar dapat menyelesaikan masalah atau membantu proses pekerjaan kita.Pada tulisan saya kali ini, saya akan berbagi sebuah tips yang saya dapatkan dari dokumentasi Laravel. Tips ini adalah tentang bagaimana kita dapat melakukan custom pada route yang dibuat oleh package laravel auth.Kita dapat menentukan route mana saja yang akan kita gunakan atau route mana yang akan kita hilangkan agar kita dapat membuat sebuah route sendiri pada route/web.php kita. Oke langsung saja kita lihat bagaimana implementasinya.Biasanya ketika kita menggunakan Authentikasi bawaan dari laravel, maka kita akan menuliskan Auth::routes() pada route/web.php kita.<?phpuse Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;// Deklrasi route untuk laravel AuthenticationAuth::routes();Pemberian kode diatas pada route kita maka akan otomatis akan membuat beberapa route yang mengarah ke Controller/Auth/. jika dilihat akan terdapat 7 route mulai dari Login, Logout, Register, Password reset, Password Confirmation, dan Email verication.Pada sebuah kasus kita tidak membutuhkan semua route tersebut, misal kita hanya membutuhkan route untuk register, login, dan logout saja, maka kita dapat melakukan disable pada beberapa route yang tidak kita butuhkan. seperti dibawah ini.Auth::routes([     'login'    => true,     'logout'   => true,     'register' => true,      'reset'    => false,  // for resetting passwords      'confirm'  => false,  // for additional password confirmations     'verify'   => false,  // for email verification ]);dengan begitu method Auth::routes() akan memberikan sebuah route untuk Login, Logout, dan register saja. oke! sampai disini mungkin kita akan bertanya-tanya, bagaimana cara kerja method Auth::routes() tersebut? kok bisa memberikan sebuah route tanpa kita menulis manual masing-masing route.Sebenarnya setiap route tetap ditulis manual kok :laughing: . Namun semua itu sudah di bundle didalam package Laravel Auth. baiklah kita akan coba lihat lebih dalam, dimana letak fungsi dari pemberian route ini. Kita akan menuju class AuthRouteMethods. (bisa kalian temukan di vendor/laravel/ui/src/AuthRouteMethods.php).class AuthRouteMethods{    /**     * Register the typical authentication routes for an application.     *     * @param  array  $options     * @return callable     */    public function auth()    {        return function ($options = []) {            // Login Routes...            if ($options['login'] ?? true) {                $this->get('login', 'Auth\LoginController@showLoginForm')->name('login');                $this->post('login', 'Auth\LoginController@login');            }                        // Logout Routes...            if ($options['logout'] ?? true) {                $this->post('logout', 'Auth\LoginController@logout')->name('logout');            }// Registration Routes...            if ($options['register'] ?? true) {                $this->get('register', 'Auth\RegisterController@showRegistrationForm')->name('register');                $this->post('register', 'Auth\RegisterController@register');            }// Password Reset Routes...            if ($options['reset'] ?? true) {                $this->resetPassword();            }// Password Confirmation Routes...            if ($options['confirm'] ??                class_exists($this->prependGroupNamespace('Auth\ConfirmPasswordController'))) {                $this->confirmPassword();            }// Email Verification Routes...            if ($options['verify'] ?? false) {                $this->emailVerification();            }        };    }Pada class tersebut dilakukan pengecekan pada parameter yang kita kirim saat memanggil Auth::routes(). Misalkan, pada code sebelumnya kita memberikan kode:Auth::routes([     'login'    => true,.....maka pada claass AuthRouteMethods parameter disimpan pada variabel $options dan dilakukan pengecekan dengan apakah $options[‘login’] bernilai true, jika iya maka akan diberikan sebuah route untuk login. begitu seterusnya untuk route auth lainnya.Oke sampai disini saja tips kali ini, mungkin terlihat simple. Namun jika kita tidak memahaminya, ya terlihat percuma saja. hehehe pendapat saya seperti itu.

Don’t Forget About These Standard Features When Creating a New Software,https://medium.com/@PZogmann/dont-forget-about-these-standard-features-when-creating-a-new-software-1260b2184ac4?source=tag_archive---------35-----------------------,"Product Management,Product,Design Thinking,Prototyping,Web Development","If you’re building new software or If you want to kickstart a software side project, you have to consider some basic functionality for it.Sketching new softwareBusiness vs. Personal IdeaThere comes a time when you want to realize your idea. Maybe your idea is business-related – you have to create a new product for your company. Or the idea comes from your passion – you’ve realized something is missing out there.Where to startMany ideas are implemented with software and can be realized as web apps (like many news pages), or desktop apps (like the Microsoft Office Suite) or smartphone apps.Before you start with the coding part of your app or the search for some technical resources that can build your app, you can start with some design sketches.Design sketches are not only useful to reflect your idea, but you can also do some first tests with your family, friends or fools if they get the value of your app. Also for your technical resources, your sketches are a good map to estimate the effort.What should I sketchFirst of all, you should sketch the user story of your solution or the pain point — that’s essential.After that, you can start to sketch some basic functionality that surrounds your idea.Here are some pages that are present in most apps:Login Page (if a login is required for your app)Create AccountForgot PasswordHome Page (first page after login)Menu (do you list your navigation in the top bar or on a sidebar or do you go the popup way with a so-called hamburger menu)Search experience (how does the search look like and how are the search results displayed)Account Settings (the page to edit all kind of user data)404 Pages (what should happen if your users land on a page that doesn’t exist — also called error pages)Also, don’t forget about some core functionality:Email Notifications (account confirmation mail, forgot password, welcome mail)Account Management (user can edit its data)User Management (edit, adding, deleting, inviting users)Billing (how is the payment processed)Written byPaul ZogmannProduct Lead @ Brutkasten Media 🚀 Love building products!

Creating A Simple Spring Boot Application,https://medium.com/@seyedsahil/creating-a-simple-spring-boot-application-9a65ecacf53b?source=tag_archive---------38-----------------------,"Spring Boot,Web Development,Web App Development,Spring,Java","Welcome to my new tutorial on Spring Boot web application development. In this tutorial, I will show you how to quick start with a simple Spring Boot web application that displays a welcome message when you hit the localhost URL.Downloading Development Kit…JDK-8 is recommended for this projectDownload Amazon Corretto Open JDK from hereConfigure the path variable JAVA_HOME to the JDK pathDownloading Spring Tool Suite…Get the latest version of Spring Tool Suite IDEExtract the zip file and prepare the IDEProject Configuration…For this tutorial, I will be using Maven dependency management system and so this will be a maven project.By default, the Spring Boot has an embedded Apache Tomcat server configured. So you can directly run the application and server will be up and running in no time.Note: It is possible to change the embedded Tomcat server.Initialize the Web Application…In this tutorial, I will be using two dependenciesSpring Web (Dependency added fore web app feature support including the Apache Tomcat default embedded container)Thymeleaf (This is a templating engine)StepsGo to Spring Initializr website.Choose the above-mentioned dependenciesSet the defaults for configuration and change the project information.Click on generate project and it will generate a Maven project for you.Extract the zip file and import the project as a Maven project to your IDE.Project Structure…Starting the Web Application…Right-click on the ProjectRun As -> Spring Boot ApplicationThis will bring up the server and you can access the web application. By default, the application will run on port 8080. So to access the web application you have to form the below-given URL.http://localhost:8080/Once you hit the URL, you will see the below Whitelabel errorSpring Boot will show a default Whitelabel error page when an error occurs. In this case, it is displayed for HTTP-404 (Not Found).This means that the default root URL ‘/’ mapping is not defined in our web application. So our next step is to define that. So when the user accesses the URL, it will return an HTML page with a message.Create the HTML Page…Note: Create the HTML file under src/main/resources/templates folderCreate the Controller…To map the root URL to the index page we have to define a mapping.StepsCreate a new class and annotate with @ControllerDefine a new mapping inside the web controllerNow if you run the application again and hit the URL, you will see the welcome page.Role of Template Engine…Here we have added the thymeleaf dependency and so Spring Boot will auto-configure this in our project. By default, the templates defined in the src/main/resources/templates folder will be picked up.You can read more about auto-configuration here.If you need additional info on how to deploy the web app in Docker check this URLDocker and Spring Boot…Hello friends, in today’s session I will show you how to create a new spring boot web application and deploy the same…medium.comEnd of TutorialThank you for reading this tutorial on Spring Boot web application development.

What is a cache?,https://medium.com/@angelo-poole/what-is-a-cache-1116a7369059?source=tag_archive---------40-----------------------,"Cache,JavaScript,Coding,Website,Web Development","Photo by Markus Winkler on UnsplashA cache is a blank area of storage on your computer that is typically used to store temporary data on your computer, The way that we use caches in web development it typically to store variables or data about something that could be time-consuming to continue to fetch such as images, videos, music and the like.A common misconception with a cache is that it is used in the same way as a cookie would be when it's not. A cookie is used to store information about the end-user while a cache would be to store longer time-consuming pieces of data. This does not stop you from placing user information in the cache, you can definitely use it to pull in user information but it's against web design principals. Also do remember that all cache methods are asynchronous and should be dealt with using async-await.When using a cache you are in charge of data cleanup for your end-user as to not clutter their device, remember that you are downloading resources onto the end-users device.Written byAngelo PooleJunior Fullstack Developer with a passion for gamingFollow106 1 106 106 1 CacheJavaScriptCodingWebsiteWeb DevelopmentMore from Angelo PooleFollowJunior Fullstack Developer with a passion for gamingMore From MediumThe 3 Virtues of Good ProgrammersRobert Quinlivan in Better ProgrammingA case for ClojureScript when developing data-heavy single page applicationsColumbia RoadImplementing Langton’s Ant in Java with a Swing UISylvain SaurelMy first steps after IntelliJ IDEA CE installationTomasz Krzysztof ZieleniewskiFour Usage Scenarios  of Underscores in PythonYang Zhou in TechToFreedomGraphQL for the Beginner PythonistasVasileios Anagnostopoulos in The StartupCommunicating using RabbitMQ in Node.jsSergey Suslov in The StartupPython Name Mangling and How to Use UnderscoresAndrew Scott in Analytics VidhyaAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

Comparing Jaguar Range Rover versus Toyota websites to learn how to align website content with your future website’s business goals.,https://medium.com/@doctormuthembwa/comparing-jaguar-range-rover-versus-toyota-websites-to-learn-how-to-align-website-content-with-7e449903b078?source=tag_archive---------42-----------------------,"Rangerover,Toyota,Web Development,Web Design,Website","When creating your website, consider how to combine your business goals with your visitor’s wants. In this topic, we will talk aboutusing your site to further your business goalsthinking like a customertelling your story onlineWebsites need to meet your business needs and the needs of your visitors. You need to think like a customer and design a website accordingly without losing sight of your own goals. Web development is an evolutionary process because the original design might have to change multiple times in the future. After all, visitors’ needs and your needs are naturally evolving with time.Aim to put your number in prominent locations, on every page of your site, even highlight it and even consider adding some text, encouraging visitors to call now and making your contact page easy to find because it’s the first page they get on your website.For range rover on the left, about us and contact us are at the bottom of the home page while at the Toyota homepage, they are at the top (easier to find).It’s also a good idea to allow mobile users to view your site to call you in literally one click. Maps, along with specific directions, can make you both very happy. Meanwhile, your customers need to know where they can find you when they are to visit the showroom or whatever you sell.What else could customers be looking for when they want to visit your site? Prices, special offers, and maybe certifications to show that you are qualified to provide a service. By making sure that all these things are available, you’ll match your business goals with your visitor’s needs. To measure what visitors are doing on your website, learn about analytics, a topic beyond this story’s scope.Let us discuss website content words, images, and videos. Avoid technical jargon and chest-beating how great you are not unless this website visitors are professionals like biochemists . Instead, try to explain you can meet the needs of a customer or a problem they have. Tell a story in the about that will connect with your customers. Testimonials or videos staring satisfied customers whose issues you have solved or letting people write reviews about products or services directly on your site.People won’t be on your site for long, so every second count.Images, headlines, and straightforward navigation can help people find what they are looking for before moving on.About us story, write it in a secure but not intimidating way. For a business like a bakery, use our everyday language, but for companies such as biotech engineering, use professional language. The tone you use should tell the story of the company and what it offers. For tech startups use business jargon and mention its type, for example.About Jaguar Land RoverToyotaPetrol and Electric powered Range RoverWritten byMuthembwaVictorBachelors Degree in Clinical Medicine and Community Health .Software Developer .Director at Visitbook mobile AppFollowRangeroverToyotaWeb DevelopmentWeb DesignWebsiteMore from MuthembwaVictorFollowBachelors Degree in Clinical Medicine and Community Health .Software Developer .Director at Visitbook mobile AppMore From MediumHow To Market Yourself Without Marketing YourselfJosh Spector in For The InterestedThe Optimal Copywriting Anatomy of a B2B Landing PageMartinEdic in Better MarketingFighting Words: Writing Like a ChallengerPrentice Howe in The StartupInbound Marketing: Why Long-form Content is King and How to Write ItMieke van der Merwe in The Startup37 Resources to Go From Basic SEO to an Advanced LevelJibreel Naqvi in Better MarketingHow to Write Killer Email Subject LinesJason McBride in Escape MotivationWe the Content CreatorsNatalie SportelliIs It Dangerous for Your Brand to Get Political?Jayson DeMers in The StartupAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

I made the school’s webpage using basic HTML. I remember having to submit the sight to Lycos and other search engines (Google was not one of them).It was the Wild West. Flash was big, VRML was going to be the future, dial up at 56K was considered blazing. If you had an ISDN line, well, you were a king.At that point, design was also whatever worked. Buttons looked like 3D buttons. You could have tiled images as the background. Heck, you want a midi file to play while people visit your palace? Mulder wouldn’t mind.I like how new technologies, like voice, seem to have this amateurish feel to them at the start. It brings out those people who are willing to try something new and different.

Hugo라는 블로그 프레임워크로 손쉽게 블로그를 만들 수 있습니다. 또한, 다양한 블로그 테마가 있어서 원하는 테마를 골라서 쓸 수 있습니다. 여러므로 편한 블로그 프레임워크인 것 같습니다.Github Pages란?깃헙 페이지란 깃헙에서 무료로 웹 호스팅을 해주는 서비스 입니다. 간혹 가다가 블로그 중에 <github username>.github.io 형식의 URL을 발견 할 수 있는데, 이게 바로 깃헙 페이지로 만든 블로그라는 뜻입니다.깃허브 페이지에서 두가지 서비스를 제공해 줍니다.사용자 페이지: github 계정당 하나씩 주는 사용자 페이지, 저장소는 username/username.github.com의 구조를 가집니다프로젝트 페이지: 프로젝트마다 만들 수 있는 페이지, 주소는 username.github.com/projectname 의 형태를 가집니다더 자세히 들어갈 수 있지만 일단 간단하게 (귀찮으니깐) 여기까지 하겠습니다 ㅎㅎHugo — Github pages 연동 방법Host on GitHub공식 문서를 참고해서 만들었습니다일단 이 3가지가 완료되었다는 가정하에 시작하겠습니다Git 2.8 이상을 설치했다Github 계정이 있다공식문서의 Quickstart를 완료했거나, Hugo를 설치했고 테마 설정에서 Configure까지 다 했다저는 깃허브에서 제공해주는 사용자 페이지에 호스팅을 할꺼니 만약 프로젝트 페이지에 호스팅을 하고 싶다면 공식 문서를 참고해 주세요.깃허브에 블로그 프로젝트를 위한 Repository를 하나 만들어 주세요 (편의상 이 Repo를 Blog Repo라고 부르겠습니다). 이 Repo에는 휴고의 Content와 다른 Source 파일들이 올라갈 겁니다. (이때 Repo URL을 복사해 둡시다)새로운 Repository를 하나 더 팝니다. 이때 Repository이름은 반드시 username.github.io 형식을 따라야 합니다 (제 github username이 daniel2231이니 daniel2231.github.io로 repo를 만들었습니다). 이 Repository에는 나중에 렌더된 파일이 올라갈 겁니다.터미널 창에 들어가 여때까지 만든 프로젝트를 아까 처음 만든 Blog Repo에 push해줍시다.이제 원하는 작업을 해주고 다했으면 hugo server을 쳐 로컬로 서버를 켜 잘 돌아가는지 한번 확인해 줍시다.만족했으면 서버를 꺼주고 git submodule add -b master [git@github.com](<mailto:git@github.com>):<USERNAME>/<USERNAME>.github.io.git public를 쳐주세요. 이때 저희가 해준건 Git의 Submodule을 만들어 빌드된 Public 폴더가 다른 remote origin을 가지게 해주는 겁니다.이걸 스크립트를 써서 간단하게 해줄 수 있습니다. root folder에 deploy.sh라는 파일을 만들어 밑에 코드와 똑같이 써줍시다.#!/bin/bashecho -e ""\\033[0;32mDeploying updates to GitHub...\\033[0m""# Build the project.hugo # if using a theme, replace with `hugo -t <YOURTHEME>`# Go To Public foldercd public# Add changes to git.git add .# Commit changes.msg=""rebuilding site `date`""if [ $# -eq 1 ]  then msg=""$1""figit commit -m ""$msg""# Push source and build repos.git push origin master# Come Back up to the Project Rootcd ..이때 쓰고 있는 테마 이름만 넣어주면 됩니다.이제 코멘드창에 ./deploy.sh ""커밋할 메세지""만 적어주면 사용자 페이지 repository로 자동으로 커밋되고 푸쉬가 될겁니다.그럼 끝~! 여러분들의 블로그가 <username>.github.io에 뜹니다!더 자세히 쓰고 싶은데, 해야 할께 많아서 많이 못썼네요 ㅠㅠ 다음에는 더 열심히 적어보도록 하겠습니다!이전 블로그에서 가져온 글입니다.Daniel’s Dev BlogDaniel’s Dev Blog | 강동헌의 개발 블로그FollowWeb DevelopmentKorean PostsWritten byKang DanielFollowFollowDaniel’s Dev BlogFollowThis is Daniel’s main dev blog | 강동헌의 개발 블로그입니다.FollowWritten byKang DanielFollowDaniel’s Dev BlogFollowThis is Daniel’s main dev blog | 강동헌의 개발 블로그입니다.More From Medium인터넷 동작 원리Kang Daniel in Daniel’s Dev BlogSKKLUB 개발 후기Kang Daniel in Daniel’s Dev Blog네이비씰 승리의 기술 후기Kang Daniel in Daniel’s Dev BlogA python IDE that you can use anywhere PostKang Daniel in Daniel’s Dev Blog2020년 회고Kang Daniel in Daniel’s Dev BlogUsing Voice Commands In ReactAidan McBride5 Fun APIs for Your Next JavaScript ProjectsMehdi Aoussiad in JavaScript In Plain EnglishDonald Trump Won, No Matter What Happens NextJessica Wildfire in The Apeiron BlogLearn more.Medium is an open platform where 170 million readers come to find insightful and dynamic thinking."

8 Must-Have Qualities of Any Websites,https://medium.com/@globaltechpie04/8-must-have-qualities-of-any-websites-70b96175b512?source=tag_archive---------51-----------------------,"Website Design,Website Development,Web Design,Web Development","How do you know your website is of high quality or not? We have covered the top eight must-have qualities, which helps you to make your website of high quality. These tips will help you to rank your website high. It will also help you to generate high-quality leads.High-quality websites are essential to appeal to your customers. If your website is well developed and well designed, then customers are more likely to stay on the website for a long time and more likely to convert into paying customers. As a Reputed Website development company in Pune, we are going to share some must-have qualities to make your website more useful.Use Images and Videos on the website:According to search metrics, the top-ranking website has roughly seven images in them. Attractive images keep users on the website for a long time. Images also help to understand any concept easily. Videos make it easier to grasp the content because users do not read the all content of your web page they just scan your website.Deep and Relevant Content:Google hates thin content. If you offer relevant and throw content then it will help you to rank your website higher in any search engine. As an erupted SEO company in Pune we suggest you write relevant and deeper content instead of stuffing keywords forcefully on your web page.Longer content:Most of the site which is ranking high on SERP has more than 900 words on a webpage. As per our experience Google rank webpages who have longer content like 1500 to 2000 words.Readability:Most of the business write to impress rather than engaged and inform users. So we suggest you use simpler words and simpler sentences. So users can easily understand your content.Scannable web formatting:As we discuss earlier users love to scan your website rather than reding. According to research approx 80 users only scan your website rather than reading. So you need to make pages by keeping in mind these things. You should have to design pages that are easy to navigate.Show your expertise:Show your expertise, because this is one of the most important ranking factors for Google. People love content from authoritative sources. Hence you have to show the expertise with your website. You can use case studies, you can use external links to show expertiseSocial media share and integration:You should have to optimize and integrate your social media pages with your website. Because social shares is also a ranking factor for Google. You can embed the share button on your post so users can easily share your post or web page on social media.Cleaver Linking:Cleaver internal link helps you to rank well on search engine result pages. You can add a hyperlink on the keyword which tells Google that this page is related to hyperlinked text or topic. When you set proper internal linking for your website it will help to send visitors on another page. This means we can say that proper linking helps you to reduce your bounce rate.Written byGlobaltechpieGlobal techpie is an IT company. it has apporox 20+ employee with more than 5 years experience.FollowWebsite DesignWebsite DevelopmentWeb DesignWeb DevelopmentMore from GlobaltechpieFollowGlobal techpie is an IT company. it has apporox 20+ employee with more than 5 years experience.More From MediumHow to market a business that shouldn’t existSam Wiltshire in The StartupSocial Media & SEO Relationship Status: It’s Complicated!Himanshu Rauthan in The StartupHonest Bob’s Simple Guide to Affiliate MarketingBob Beacham in The Pro Writers GroupHow Much Does SEO Cost? | A Guide for B2B BusinessesJesse Kerema in The StartupUp-Sell, Down-Sells, Cross-Sells, and Fist-Bumps — Oh My!August Birch in The StartupAn Editorial Approach to Marketing: Shifting from ‘Brand Story’ to ‘Brand Perspective’Kyle Monson in Cover StoryThe most effective marketing channels?

What would be the correct way to code this to ensure the page loads the smallest image required to fill the space?the code below uses the matchMedia method on the DOM window interface in order to query the client’s window size. this sounds heady, but if you’re in a place where you want to save a few kilobytes or so per image by archiving differently sized versions of the same image, then this shouldn’t be too complicated. consider the code below:hardcorelines 23–27 could be replaced withsuper hardcoreor if you want to do it the easy way that i wish i knew about before writing all the above code, try this js-free snippet instead:easy modesee, look how easy that is to understand now! YOU’RE WELCOME.if you want the source — and a perfect explanation — of the last snippet:mdn article on responsive imagesthe srcset attribute contains various image-size versions, followed by a space and then the image’s actual width in pixels, and the sizes attribute contains each media query (max-width: 600px)) followed by a space and then the width of the slot to be filled on your page. the browser will ignore each media query after the first truthy one, so order matters (notice this serves the same purpose as the else...if statement in my javascript code block above). lastly, the last size you specify (without a media query next to it, such as 800px in the above snippet) is the default one which will be used when none of the media queries return true.When should you npm and when should you yarn?yarn and npm are basically the exact same thing. yarn was facebook’s attempt in 2016 to address the weaknesses of npm such as how slow it was to install modules, how it did not keep track of which version your dependencies were at time of package creation, and just the little things like more convenient commands which give a finer aspect of control when managing your package (giggity). in the past 4 years however, npm has made leaps and bounds in improvement and the gap is smaller than ever before. does that mean it’s just as useful as yarn? no, yarn still has many advantages such as speed (though not as glaring as before), better security (since you can be a bit more specific about which dependencies are upgraded and to which version if at all), and generally more control still over your modules. does this mean yarn is the obvious choice? no, because yarn is simply built on top of npm and it can never truly replace it. so a huge benefit to npm will always be simplicity, since one package manager is always simpler than two. but if you have more eccentric needs when it comes to controlling your dependencies (such as caching your dependencies so they are much quicker to install and can easily maintain their same version), yarn might be the way to go. yarn is actually in the midst of a major overhaul (code name berry), so npm will have to continue to keep up with competitors; the debate will be ongoing. on a final note, check out pnpm and other package managers, as yarn vs. npm does not cover all the alternatives.How can you make sure your dependencies are safe?the most basic thing you can do is be completely sure you are installing the exact module you mean to install, as there are malicious individuals who make similarly-named modules in order to backdoor into your computer (what a world, isn’t it?). you should also keep track of your dependencies to an extent (which is nigh-impossible as your dependencies have sub-dependencies and these add up quick to a filespace that no man should have to track. but what you could do is use a command such as depcheck which searches through your requires statements and returns stuff like: /proj/Hardy $ depcheckUnused dependencies* cucumber* selenium-standaloneUnused devDependencies* jasmine-node^credit to https://blog.risingstack.com/controlling-node-js-security-risk-npm-dependencies/ which is also worth checking out. you could also run npm audit fix to install updates to vulnerable dependencies (which may or may not break some code).and unless you’re a devNinja then i would suggest not using less popular or experimental frameworks/modules/libraries as these are the first targets of malicious attackers. use well-established, popular, highly-documented, and heavily-debugged modules, and let the ninjas guinea pig the new shinies.you could also pay a service like “snyk” to monitor your app consistently, if you got it like that.What are the differences between CHAR and VARCHAR data types (MySQL)?so CHAR(x) is a variable that whatever value you pass as an argument to x will always be that length, whereas in VARCHAR(x) x is just a maximum and its value is determined by the actual value of its content. i know this sounds confusing, but it’s simple. CHAR(50) will always represent 50 bytes (even if its content = “michael” but VARCHAR(50) could potentially represent 7 bytes if its content = “michael”.How else can the JavaScript code below be written using Node.Js to produce the same output?console.log(“first”);setTimeout(function() { console.log(“second”);}, 0);console.log(“third”);// Output:// first// third// secondwhile there might be several ways, an immediate one that comes to mind (you’ll get that joke in a second) is this:console.log(“first”);setImmediate(function(){console.log(“second”);});console.log(“third”);ok it didn’t come to mind immediately either, i had to google it a bit.now i’ll explain how it works, but it’s complicated and i’m tired so i’ll just quote from nodejs.dev:Any function passed as the setImmediate() argument is a callback that’s executed in the next iteration of the event loop.How is setImmediate() different from setTimeout(() => {}, 0) (passing a 0ms timeout), and from process.nextTick()?A function passed to process.nextTick() is going to be executed on the current iteration of the event loop, after the current operation ends. This means it will always execute before setTimeout and setImmediate.A setTimeout() callback with a 0ms delay is very similar to setImmediate(). The execution order will depend on various factors, but they will be both run in the next iteration of the event loop.does it seem like they didn’t even answer the question and just looped back around to eventually saying “it depends.”? yeah i’d agree. but i was also able to find this in their docs:setImmediate() is designed to execute a script once the current poll phase completes. setTimeout() schedules a script to be run after a minimum threshold in ms has elapsed.so basically, setImmediate is the same as setTimeout() with a 0ms delay, since it doesn’t wait at all and just takes the very next turn. but i wouldn’t worry about all the tiny specifics between these, as MDN web docs had this to say about setImmediate():Non-standardThis feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.so just keep using setTimeout() and be happy about it (or be upset about it i guess, but how could anyone be upset while writing JavaScript??).Written byMichael Scogginsstudent of Austin Coding Academy. looking for a full-stack (MERN... with a flexible M) web dev position.FollowCodingWeb DevelopmentAustin Coding AcademyLubbock Coding AcademyMore from Michael ScogginsFollowstudent of Austin Coding Academy. looking for a full-stack (MERN... with a flexible M) web dev position.More From MediumA Quick Vue3 Infinite Scrolling Component — Daily Vue Tips #4Matt Maribojoc in JavaScript In Plain EnglishCool Custom Cursors With React + Framer Motion: Part 1Levon Arakelyan in The StartupA place for every mapper!Jon RistaWhat you need to know about Sails.jsLauren Adam in Upstate InteractiveUsing DataLoader to batch API requestsColloque Tsui in The StartupAngular 6 is Out!

There are many good examples from Next.js and the community that are worth to see in this link.There are several of ORM engines in Node.js ecosystem such as Sequelize, TypeORM and Objection. I had working with Sequelize before and I want to share to you about how I have managed to combine it with Next.js.Request and Response can be used in the API pages in your project without any addition of custom server like Express.js. This is the explanation from Next.js API route support./** ./pages/api/hello.js **/export default (req, res) => {   res.statusCode = 200;   res.json({ name: ""John Doe"" });};So far this is one of my favourite features from the latest Next.js version. This feature can be use as a Full-Stack Development, and could be an effective replacement to custom servers in Next.js app such as express. It can be use to connect into external API or backend system to access databases like MongoDB / NoSQL or MySQL / SQL.Next.js with Sequelize web applicationRequirements are Sequelize-cli, Database drivers, JWT (jsonwebtoken) and of course Next.js with the React library. For this project purpose this is the complete package.json setup :package.json for Next.js and SequelizeSetup Note: This application uses SQLite in local development and PostGres in production for the RDBMS. It is up to you if you want to use MySQL both in local and production. You can skip to install SQLite parts and take a look at the table schema files for the database structure.Next.js Setupnpx create-next-app or just create-next-app and type your project name nextjs-sequelize or any name.

Generated files will be used to make Sequelize modules run with the project.Sequelize init generated filesThese files and directories generated via Sequelize-cli command. If you want to move and organise into a different directory, use .sequelizerc like the one I used in this project.Using .sequelizerc fileSequelize have a project setup file that you can you use to organised your project directory. Meaning that you can put and setup your Sequelize files in a specific directory like the way you want it to be in a file called .sequelizerc. Below is the sample that Sequelize files and directory will be generated in a directory named /db in your project root. Just type sequelize init to generate Sequelize project from a .sequelizerc file.const path = require('path');module.exports = {   'config': path.resolve('db/config', 'config.js'),   'models-path': path.resolve('db', 'models'),   'seeders-path': path.resolve('db', 'seeders'),   'migrations-path': path.resolve('db', 'migrations')};Initialing Sequelize in our Next.js project rootGenerated Sequelize files and directory in /db/ directory inside Next.js project rootOpen up config.js in editor and add an export default to the files like these one and replace the config and put your env variables from .env.local :Sequelize config.jsSequelize config.js with Node .env variablesSetup install for Sequelize, Sqlite3 and Mysql2 modulesSequelize-cli will be use for generating migrations and models setup.

Build your own website as a complete beginner: No nonsense guide,https://towardsdatascience.com/build-your-own-website-as-a-complete-beginner-no-nonsense-guide-45f6db28880f?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Web Development,Static Site Generator,Hugo,Github,Netlify","Image by StartupStockPhotos from PixabayI have always wanted to blog and have my own website and I finally did! It feels so good!I never imagined myself being a web developer. Honestly, web development itself along with all the technical things behind it sounds boring to me. what actually excites me is the designing part of the website. How you do the graphics, the interactivity, the colors, the layout. You name it. I think a web designer should not only be technically proficient but also be a creative and artistic individual who can think out of the box :)Apparently I have no clue about web development and the idea of learning CSS, HTML and JS from scratch does not sound very ideal. I have been Googling around and feel overwhelmed by all the languages, platforms and learning resources out there. If you feel the same, no worries. You are not alone. And trust me, you don’t have to be a HTML and CSS expert to start building things. Once you know a few fundamentals, you can learn as you build.My learning style is more towards video tutorials. When you learn things, you probably don’t learn from one single source, Freecodecamp and Edureka are greats places to pick up fundamentals css, js and html if you are a beginner. You can also find this amazing CSS and HTML free course by Edwin Diaz on Udemy. These are my favorites.In this article, I will show you how to build and deploy a static website using a combination of Hugo + Github + Netlify. Actually I got to know about static site and using Netlify thanks to a friend who built her own website using Gatsby.What is a static site generator?A static site generator is an application that applies data and content written in Markdown language to templates, and generates a view of a page in the form of static html files, ready to be delivered to visitors. The application itself can be written in any languages, for example, Ruby (Jekyll), JavaScript and React (Gatsby). I tried Gatsby at the beginning because it seems to have a very thriving community. After one week constantly encountering bugs and debugging, I finally succeeded in installing Gatsby and downloading a Gatsby site’s template. However, I, in the end, decided to go for Hugo, which is a Static Site Generator written in Go, because it is very user friendly and it wasn’t really necessary for me to understand Go. You can find a detailed comparison between Gatsby and Hugo in this article.Alright, enough talking. Let’s get started!Part 1. Building your static site with HugoA.Hugo installation#1.Install ChocolatelyTo get Hugo installed on your Windows Operating System, you need to make sure you install Chocolately, which is a package manager for Windows.#2. Install Hugo Once Chocolately is installed, you can simply install Hugo with this command in your terminal:choco install hugo -confirmFor Mac and Linux users, please see the installation guidelines here.Great! Now you should have Hugo installed on your system. Let’s start building your website!B.Building your website#1. Generate Hugo siteThe next thing you need to do is to generate your site with Hugo CLI. Open up your terminal and type the following command:hugo new site your_project_nameA folder will be created with the same name (your_project_name) you provided. You should now have a directory at C:\User\Hugo\Sites\your_project_name. The default folder structure will look like this:The following is a high-level overview of each of the directories:Config.tomlThis is the main configuration file for a Hugo site. This is where you can specify information about your site like the site title and description. Check out the config docs for more detail.ContentThe content of your website, for example, your blog posts, photos will live inside this directory. Each folder in Hugo is considered a content section. For example, if your site has three main sections — blog, fashion, and art — you will have three sub-directories including blogs, fashion and art in the Content directory.LayoutsYou can define really complex layout for your website. There’s is a lot you can do. The layout folder stores templates for each section from the content in the form of .html files that describes how views of your content will be rendered into a static website.StaticThis directory stores all the static content — things that don’t change: like images, css and JavaScript.ThemesYou can just download a prebuilt template and put it in the themes folder and boom! You have your website. You can adapt the theme in the way you want your website to look like.#2. Get the site run locallyIn the directory of your website on the terminal, type the following command: hugo serverWhat this command does is it starts a local development server that hosts your website on your machine.Note: If you get an error message: Error: Unable to locate config file or config directory. Make sure you are inside the folder that contains the config.toml file.Now if you go to your browser: http://localhost:1313/, you should see your website there. You will get a white page though because the server is running but there is no theme/content yet.#3. Select a themeAs a beginner, I find it extremely helpful to have a template and work with well-structured and formatted code. You can always adapt the code in the way you want your website to look like. Hugo is very user friendly and it allows you to use pre-built themes. You can go to the hugo’s theme site and there are hundreds of themes you can choose from. They are all open source. Click on the demo and you can see how the website looks like and select the one of your choice.Let’s say, you want to install hugo-scroll theme, from your terminal within your Hugo project directory, type the following command:git clone https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-scroll.git .\themes\hugo-scroll(Note: if the development server is still running, you need to hit Ctrl-C to kill it so that you can come back to the Hugo directory)You should now see a directory with the name “hugo-scroll” inside the themes directory of your website folder.#4.ConfigurationNext we need to tell Hugo that we want to use the newly installed theme. Add the following line to your config.toml:theme = “hugo-scroll”If you now view your website hosted on localhost, you will see that the theme is applied directly. This is because Hugo tracks all the files needed to build your website and will rebuild the website and force a reload of the page in your web browser whenever you edit a file.I am sure you will want to change things in the website’s template, for example, the name of your website ! Let’s go to the config.toml file again in your text editor platform, in my case I use Sublime. You can also use another platform like VisualStudio. You can add the title of your site.By the way, make sure you read the license file. What it basically says is that the person who created the theme is not going to be liable for anything you change in the theme if you get trouble with that.Part 2. Host your website with Github and netlify#1. Find a place to host your codeYou need a GitHub account for this. If you have not made it yet, please create one here. The next thing to do is to create a repository on Github. Go to the repository and click “New”:Next, upload your website folder there by going to the directory of your website and typing the following commands:git initgit add .git commit –m “first commit”git remote add origin <url_of_your_repository>git push –u origin masterBy now, you should see all the subfolders in your website folder on your git repository.#2. Deploy your website with NetlifyNetlify is a web-developer platform that offers hosting and serverless backend services for web applications and static websites. The way it works is that Netlify connects to your github accounts, goes through your git repository and copies all those codes over to Netlify and processes and publish the site. Follow these steps below:Step 1. Create a Netlify accountStep 2. Connect your Netlify account with your Github account.Step 3. Deploy your site on Netlify.You can find a detail instruction on Netlify’s website. After this process, Netlify will create a funny defaulted url — random_name.netlify.app for you. In my case, the name is: Affectionate-hermann-8298bf. Click on the link to see that your website is now live! Congratuuuuulations!#3.Create Custom DomainOf course, you would want to have your own domain name rather than a fun random name from Netlify! Find in this post a step by step guide to creating a custom domain for your website.Update your websiteTo update your site, first, you need to make changes to your website locally. You can also see how the website looks like before pushing it to Git Repo at http://localhost:1313/ by running:hugo serverI was amazed to see the changes get updated on your local machine in less than a second! How cool huh? To push your changes to your website, you first need to add changes, commit and push them to your Git repository using the following commands:git add .git commit -m ""Updates website""git push origin masterNetlify will detect the changes you push to your git repo immediately and go back to the Netlify site to deploy the new changes which will happen in just a matter of few seconds! See in the snapshot below, Netlify builds, processes and publishes in the same minute.ConclusionA Hugo template doesn’t build a perfect website. However, as a beginner, you can set up a site based on the template first, and build upon it as you learn more HTML, CSS, and GO skills. Take baby steps. Practice makes perfect.I hope that this helps with learning and give you some motivation to build your own website. I would be happy to look at your website once you are done building it.

9 Things I Wish I’d Known When I Started as a Web Developer,https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/9-things-i-wish-id-known-when-i-started-as-a-web-developer-6ff55928cda6?source=tag_archive---------2-----------------------,"Web Development,JavaScript,Technology,Tech,Programming","Photo by Joshua Aragon on UnsplashWeb Development is an amazing career that is in demand right now and there is no sign of decline instead the demand has been skyrocketing!Along with high job satisfaction you also get paid well as a web developer, but there are many more perks. Some I have listed down below.Highly satisfying profession 🖥️Pays you good bucks 💲You get to build cool stuff 🔨You can work remotely from your home 🏡It has been reported that the employment of web developers is projected to grow 13 percent from 2018 to 2028, much faster than the average for all occupations. Demand will be driven by the growing popularity of mobile devices and ecommerce.I have been developing websites for around 5 years and what a journey it has been! But while learning web development it is important to know some things beforehand so that you don’t face frustration and disappointment. You can possibly waste your time and might take longer to become a web developer.I have listed down 9 lessons that I believe every developer needs to know.That being said let's dive into further.1. You won’t become a good developer 💻 in 3 monthsA lot of online courses make these crazy promises that you’ll be a great developer after 10–12 weeks and it’s not true.You will probably have a good foundation to start on, but it won’t be enough to do the really complex things from day one. It’ll take a lot of practice, time, and frustration in the beginning. Be prepared to tackle it!2. Don’t just read 📖, implementI’ve often seen developers read through tutorials or sometimes even whole books without practicing what they have learned. Learning by practicing works best while learning to code. Do a lot of projects, these will help you solidify your concepts better.If you want to learn React js, try to develop a small application as you are going through the documentation or a set of tutorials. If you want to try the MERN stack, get it running in your local machine and explore the different options — that’s the best way to learn!3. JavaScript first, framework laterPeople often first learn the tricks of a framework and then move on to the language. That’s actually not the right way to go.The simple reason here is that if you know about the underlying JavaScript, it helps you understand how the framework works. If you have no idea about the trades of a language, there is no way you will understand why something is done a certain way in the framework.Avoid Frameworks and Plugins until you have an intermediate understanding of JavaScript.4. Write Clean Code 💎The first thing you realize when you start making large applications is that a huge amount of time is required for debugging. Often, you’ll spend more time debugging than writing new code. You are going to spend 25% of your time writing code, and 75% debugging that code.In such a situation, it’s highly important you write properly indented and commented code, which adheres to best practices.Code without comments and indentations will lead you in big trouble. Imagine you have hundreds of lines of code, and you have no idea what’s causing a small bug. What’s worse is that if you write an unreadable code, you’ll probably fail to understand what each snippet does after a few days.5. Design PatternsOne of my biggest mistakes was that I never learned any design patterns early on. So, I approached each new project with a blank slate.Not leaning Design Patterns leads to a lot more work, a lot more frustrating, and leads to poorly written code (usually).Invest some time in learning a design pattern and become a master of implementing it. Believe me, it is worth all the effort.6. Learn version controlIn today’s world, it’s very rare that you work on a project alone or you will need to in the future. To collaborate with others, you need to learn something called version control!Developers usually don’t dive into version control until they absolutely need to do so. However, as version control is necessary to work in a team, it’s a good idea to understand how it works and the basic commands that get you started early on.The most popular one is Git from GitHub, literally I haven't seen a professional developer who doesn't use Git.7. Jack of all trades, master of noneIt’s good to explore new technologies, but one must remember to stick to one language for most purposes. I prefer to use JavaScript, I love it a lot.It’s always tempting to learn multiple languages at the same time, but it’s advisable to stick to one until you develop a certain level of mastery over it.8. Learn from the work of othersMastering a technology on your own is great, but sometimes you learn a lot by just looking at the code of others. Be it your colleagues or random tutorials on the internet, try to find why someone approaches a problem in a certain way, and ask questions if necessary, don't be shy, developers are friendly and willing to help.9. Google is your best friend ⌨️As a developer, we have to learn a lot and we as humans suck at it. That's why Google was built for. Like learning to learn is important, the skill of googling is a must In a developer's life.There are many ways to submit a search query on google. Try to google and find out.The life of a developer is not easy, and becoming one is tough but not impossible. But there is tremendous satisfaction, joy, and glory on the other side but first, you need to endure the frustration and difficulties.The feeling that you will get, the first time you build a project from scratch is breathtaking. There are many friendly developers waiting for you on the other side.Until then take care!JavaScript In Plain EnglishDid you know that we have three publications and a YouTube channel?

"Just Finished a Paid Career Path, Am I a Web Developer Now?",https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/just-finished-a-paid-career-path-am-i-a-web-developer-now-85ff53b7580c?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"JavaScript,Work,Programming,Web Development,Web","WebSuck behind the paywall? Click here to read the full story with my friend link!So, 3 months ago, I woke up at 3 pm, earlier than usual, thinking about which movie to watch. Opened Facebook, saw some people posting about CodeCademy offering free Pro Memberships for Covid-19. Was kinda amazed and applied right away.Web Developer Career PathNow, after reading many reviews and articles, I decided that I’d study Web Development form the platform. Then, there were either courses that I’d have to enroll and complete or the whole Career Path. Not gonna lie, the career path seemed like a ton of work in the start but I eventually made up my mind to go for that rather than to manually choose what to study. Also, I feel like its easier when someone does the tough job for you i.e. The curriculum-making, etc. So, as y’all would’ve guessed, I decided to go with the Career Path.Ah, shit!Well, the Curriculum starts off easy peasy, with HTML. I was like ‘HTML, dat easy!’, and it was. But along the way, I kinda started getting the gist of the platform, i.e. you read one line, write four. It became cool to practice the concepts right after learning about them.It was all pieces of cakes until I reached to JavaScript.JavaScriptNow, nothing so special about this, but the Whole Curriculum consists of 7 modules of Javascript out of 14.For discussing the reason, let’s talk about Js now. Web Development is mainly Front End & Back End.Front End is the part that we, the users, see and interact with and Back End being the one with which we, the developers, interact. ‘What role Js plays in’ you might ask, so, lemme tell y’all that React.js is considered to be the best Front End Library to be used. And what do you think the ‘js’ means in the name? C’mon, give it a try!........Tried? ‘JavaScript’, is that what you say? Damn! you’re intelligent.ClapLet’s switch to Back End. The language taught for Back End on the platform is Node.js. There’s also SQL, but that’s just for making changes to the data. And what is ‘js’ in Node.js? — Bruh! what you doing, Einstein. — Yeah, exactly what you think, JavaScript! YAY.Also, I must mention here that I feel like JavaScript deserves the attention given to it. Because C’mon, you won’t like a website with shows a picture of a rock, paper, and scissors, YOU WANT TO PLAY THAT! So, for the website to — :Get your clickDecide what to doRespond backbasically, THINK!— it requires JavaScript. JavaScript is like the brain of the Web Dev. It makes the website feel stuff i.e. your click, hovering, etc. It also makes the website decide on its own what to do if a certain action is undertaken i.e. OnClick(), onActive(), etc. But this is just for the Front End, talking about Back End, Boi, its Js everywhere.Enough with the Career Path talk. Let’s talk business.ThoughtsFirstly, let me tell you all that it took me 3 months to see the 100% mark. Countless all-nighters, stressful coding sessions, feeling like killing myself, but here we are, through all the thick and thin, we here.Certificate BABAYYYYYYY!Okay, enough of this BS, what I truly believe is that the Curriculum pays much lesser heed to the Back End Stuff as compared to how much it pays towards Front End. To give you an insight, 10 modules are dedicated to Front End and 4 to Back End. They must increase the content of Node.js or any other Back end library/framework in the curriculum because C’mon, there must a balance or else just call it ‘Front End Developer’.Also, the Projects! Boi of Boi were they —var interruption = [‘A pain in the *’, ‘The best thing on the platform!’];— So, Projects aye? Lemme give it a heading.ProjectsThere were a total of 77 Projects in the Career Path.Woah!!Honestly, the Projects are the best thing that is present. That is because some of them really, when I say ‘really’ I mean it, challenging. Let’s take some of the biggest Projects:LodashRevenousJammingExpressoGold Medal MetricsNeed to see all my Projects? Hop onto Github.And completing this many projects, you tend to pick up a thing or two. But the project I want to boast on is Sound Clone. But before I show you the project, tell me, ‘do you like this? → ’Particle.js← And Songs? If you answered ‘yes’, congratulations mate! you belong to a species called Human Beings, who tend to pull each other’s legs for their good. And now, you may want to visit this Repository or the Website itself. If you like the idea, give it a like, it’s free!Serious TalkNow, that I’ve mentioned Web Development several times to get high scores on the SEO chart. Let’s talk about what I can conclude and what you can learn from me.ConclusionI know those 77 projects sound like a ton deal but trust me, 20–30 of those are a joke and at-most 15 are those which actually challenge you to the bare bottom. And in my opinion, those are the ones which actually make you learn stuff. Despite the fact that I’ve studied this all for 3 months, have written thousands of lines of code in this short span but I still feel like I lack the knowledge’s implementation.Lack of ImplementationFirst, let me tell you how the projects on the platform work. All the projects are designed to test certain knowledge and they do. But doing the code when you’re told each and every line, is not really coding! I feel like, all the projects did was that I’d now read any text more attentively and would follow documentation more closely. Now, I know Documentation is important to know about and following them, as compared to watching youtube videos is considered a better coding practice but Boi, you kidding me?. Telling me each and every line I have to write won’t improve my coding skills. Now, I know people who have taken courses at CodeCademy would say ‘They don’t tell us about all the lines.’ But consider these two:‘Write a function that returns the maximum number from an array.’OR‘Write an integer returning function which would take an array as the parameter, you need to iterate over the array and save the maximum number into a new variable and then return it.’See? I know some people would say that the second one is better, but in the real world, the companies, your boss won’t use that sentence, rather her secretary would use the first sentence.And I feel like this is the thing which will keep us, the course students, from becoming confident in programming, because if we get used to being told each and every step that we need to do, we won’t be confident in doing anything from our own. For example, let’s suppose I’m asked the same task as above i.e. to find the max out of array. Now, these questions will be my enemies:Do I get the array’s size/length as a parameter?Do I have to iterate over the whole array or can I use any built-in method/function?Batman vs Superman?Do I need to create a new variable or splice all the numbers lower than the maximum number? (ik, very noob)Why use a function? use the Math.max() function instead.— etc. These are some of the questions that I’ll have to face and I, who never choose between such options, will get confused.Confused#%.So, to conclude, this is my opinion on these Career Paths. Tell me if you disagree and share your opinion in the comments below. I’d love to read it!Also, if you’re doing the career path and are stuck somewhere, feel free to check out my Github Repo.Let’s connect!

Google Cloud SQL — Tips & Tricks,https://medium.com/@koistya/google-cloud-sql-tips-tricks-d0fe7106c68a?source=tag_archive---------4-----------------------,"Google Cloud Platform,Nodejs,Web Development,Google Cloud,Sql","Google Cloud SQL, PostgreSQL EditionWhen creating a new Cloud SQL instance…Ensure that the instance name is picked wisely. You may find it helpful if it remains short, and contains the Cloud SQL edition (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server) and version number. For example, pg12.https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/Down the road, when you’ll be upgrading it to the newer version, you would create a separate Cloud SQL instance (e.g. pg14) backup data from the previous database instance and restore it in the new one. Note that renaming a Cloud SQL instance (ID) is not possible, as well as changing its region. When you delete a Cloud SQL instance, you will not be able to create a new instance with the same name, at least not within the next couple of months.Most likely you will be using a separate GCP project for each deployment environment ( prod, stading, test, dev). In which case, adding the environment (slug) into the instance name is not necessary.Enable access from public IP addresses solely for development and administration convenience. Whitelist IP addresses (or, IP ranges) from which it would be allowed to access the database. You would also need to restrict access to the database without a valid SSL certificate.If unsure, pick “micro” database instance size (shared vCPU, 0.6 GB RAM, $8/month), it should handle a small web application payload just fine unless something is misconfigured.Once the database instance (VM) is created, go to its settings > Connections, disable unsecured connections, and download client and server SSL certificates to your web application project.When creating a database…During development, it’s totally fine to use a single instance of Cloud SQL, just create a separate database per deployment environment. Adding environment name (slug) to database names would help to ensure that whenever you administer it, it would be clear to which environment the opened database belongs, right in your face 😄example — productionexample_dev — development; shared development environmentexample_test — test / QAexample_test_123 — review app; automatically created per PRexample_local — local instance of PostgreSQL databaseRight before releasing your app to the public, you would just copy the production database to a separate Cloud SQL instance.When creating these databases, ensure that the correct charset and collation are used.Connecting to a Cloud SQL instance from Node.jsYou may find it convenient to place database connection settings into .env files, this way you will be able to re-use them for different purposes — launching the app, migrating database, configuring CI/CD workflows, etc.In the case of PostgreSQL, the environment variables would look like this:# PostgreSQL# https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq-envars.htmlPGHOST=104.197.10.130PGPORT=5432PGUSER=postgresPGPASSWORD=~E7Rf][k*P/$9.%FPGDATABASE=example_devPGSSLMODE=verify-caPGSSLCERT=./ssl/client-cert.dev.pemPGSSLKEY=./ssl/client-key.dev.pemPGSSLROOTCERT=./ssl/server-ca.dev.pemPGSERVERNAME=example-dev:pg12These settings will be used for local development, and during deployment, you would inject slightly different settings:PGHOST=/cloudsql/example-dev:us-central1:pg12PGUSER=postgresPGPASSWORD=~E7Rf][k*P/$9.%FPGDATABASE=example_devIt would ensure that the app efficiently connects to the Cloud SQL instance through a Unix socket available to Cloud Functions, Cloud Run, and App Engine apps.For this to work, you just need to ensure that Cloud SQL Admin API is enabled in the project where your app is being hosted, and the service account under which the app is running (e.g. example@appspot.gserviceaccount.com) is granted the Cloud SQL Client (or, a more permissive) IAM role in the GCP project with the database.Once these environment variables are loaded into the app (see dotenv , envalid), initializing a new database client can be done without explicitly passing any connection settings other than SSL and connection pool size.Note that the servername option needs to match the server name listed on the SSL certificate. Otherwise, the connection would fail with the following error:Error [ERR_TLS_CERT_ALTNAME_INVALID]: Hostname/IP does not match certificate's altnames: Host: localhost. is not cert's CN: example-dev:pg12Do not disable certificate verification by setting rejectUnauthorized: false.Switching between environments…Ensure that you can easily specify the target database when launching the app locally as well as running any db administration scripts. For example:$ yarn start                   # Connects to `example_dev` (default)$ yarn start --env=local       # Connects to the local database$ yarn start --env=test        # Connects to the test (QA) database$ yarn db:migrate --env=local  # Migrates local database$ yarn db:migrate --env=test   # Migrates test (QA) databaseStoring db passwords…While it’s totally fine to store the (shared) dev database password in the code repository, storing production secrets must be avoided. Below is a couple of lightweight approaches that you can use for that purpose.(1) Add .env.*.override files to .gitignore and move PGPASSWORD env variables to the env files that are not being committed to the code repo..env.local           # Settings for local database.env.dev             # Settings for dev (shared) database.env.test            # Settings for test (QA) database.env.prod            # Settings for production database.env.prod.override   # Overrides for prod environmentWhich would be loaded by using dotenv like this:import dotenv from ""dotenv"";import minimist from ""minimist"";const { env } = minimist(process.argv.slice(2), {  default: { env: ""dev"" }});dotenv.config({ path: `.env.${env}.override` });dotenv.config({ path: `.env.${env}` });(2) Alternatively, store db passwords and other secrets encrypted and decrypt them at runtime by either using Google Cloud Secret Manager or a master passphrase from .env.override file that would be excluded from the repository via .gitignore.Optionally, add a script for reading/writing secrets from/to .env files:yarn env:set {name} {secret}     # Encrypt and save to .env.{env}yarn env:get {name}              # Read from .env.{env} and decryptThis can be easily implemented by using the nativecrypto Node.js module.Do not encrypt passwords for the “dev” environment. It will make it easier for everyone on your team to just clone the repo and launch the project without a need to configure or install anything (other than Node.js).Using Cloud SQL Proxy…It’s also possible to use Google Cloud SQL proxy when connecting to a Cloud SQL server from the local machine (or, CI/CD server). This way, you will not need to worry about tweaking SSL and Cloud SQL firewall settings. But, I personally find it less convenient.Using PostgreSQL CLI tools…If you’re planning to use a hosted version of SQL database most of the time, it’s possible to install just the CLI tools without installing the whole PostgreSQL server on your local machine. On macOS, psql, pg_dump, pg_restore, and other CLI tools can be installed using Homebrew:$ brew install libpqCreating backups…By default, Google Cloud SQL will write backups to a Google Storage bucket daily, you would just need to configure the backup window when these operations will be taking place.In addition to that, you need to ensure that a fresh backup of the production database is created as part of the CI/CD deployment workflow.The example source code is available on GitHub, see Node.js API Starter Kit.BTW, if you have a solid startup idea and would like to join our efforts in bringing it to life, please don’t hesitate to get in touch on Discord or Telegram, I’ll be happy to discuss it an see how we could collaborate.See you around!Written byKonstantin TarkusBringing the technical edge to early-stage companies with advice on software architecture, best practices, database design, web infrastructure, and DevOps.Follow30 1 30 30 1 Google Cloud PlatformNodejsWeb DevelopmentGoogle CloudSqlMore from Konstantin TarkusFollowBringing the technical edge to early-stage companies with advice on software architecture, best practices, database design, web infrastructure, and DevOps.More From MediumCREATE: Shop List with FlutterVeli Bacık in Flutter CommunityA crash course on integers in two’s complement in a computerAlonso Del Arte in Dev GeniusCreating Magic Functions in IPython — Part 1Sebastian WitowskiCreating ‘Qalam’Stink StudiosPython’s GIL — A Hurdle to Multithreaded ProgramRachit Tayal in Python FeaturesThe Walled Gardens within ElixirMarcel OttoHow to Find Your Mutual Connections on MediumAnupam Chugh in Better ProgrammingBuilding a Better Hybrid Data Access Solution in .NET with Entity Framework + RepoDbMichael Pendon in Dev GeniusAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
"<strong class=""bz"">13 Super Useful Chrome DevTools Tips to Speed Up Your Developing Workflow</strong>",https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/13-super-useful-chrome-devtools-tips-to-speed-up-your-developing-workflow-e9ecb60fda5c?source=tag_archive---------5-----------------------,"Javascript Tips,Web Development,Debugging,Testing,Coding","Photo by Katie Rodriguez on UnsplashDo you want to improve your developing workflow? If so, you definitely want to check out Chrome DevTools.This tool provides you amazing features to help you test, debug, and enhance your website.Below are 13 common tips when using Chrome DevTools:1. Unminify FilesEvery resource file like JS/CSS has to be minified before getting lived on production in order to reduce the project’s size. For debugging purposes, you can unminify them for better readability by click the {} symbol at the bottom left.2. Switch Between FilesAs Chrome DevTools is active in on web page, you can quickly open/switch to any project files by pressing CMD + P (Ctrl + P).3. Edit CSSIf you’re anything like me, you use this feature the most. I tend to check if the colors, spaces, font size to be perfect before putting the final code into the source.To change the CSS of an element, you need to select that element and, then you can edit the corresponding CSS properties under the Styles panel.4. Search Source CodeWant to find any piece of code? Simply press Cmd + option + F (Ctrl + Shift + F)5. Set BreakpointsIt’s helpful to insert breakpoints during debugging to know exactly what’s happening at a certain line of code. To insert breakpoints in Chrome DevTools, just decide what line you want to break and scroll to that line number and click on it. After that, press Cmd + R (Ctrl + R) to refresh the page and then the execution will pause at the breakpoint you set.6. Access a Line NumberTo quickly jump right into a certain line number, you can press Cmd + O (Ctrl + O) and type the line number and the column you want to be at. For example, :40:157. Edit HTML DirectlyWhen you want to test out a new piece of code, you can edit HTML in the DevTools. The changes happen immediately on the browser so that you can preview if it’s perfect or not. This is time-saving because you don’t have to change the source code (sometimes you need to wait for the build).To edit HTML, all you have to do is picking an HTML tag and double-clicking on it.8. Drag and Drop ElementsYou can also drag and drop elements to change their positions on the site.9. Change Device Mode“Mobile first.” It’s a term we regularly hear these days. Chrome DevTools is very supportive in this area. It provides many virtual devices with different screen sizes so that you can make sure everything is OK for most devices before going live.To test on a device, press Cmd + shift + M (Ctrl + shift + M) or click the phone/tablet icon in the tool.10. Clear CookiesWhen you make some changes from the source code but it doesn’t affect the web page, chances are cookie’s playing its role.You can clear selected cookies or even all of them in Application > Storage > Cookies.11. Add Multiple CursorsSometimes you need to change multiple lines to the same code. You can edit multiple lines of code at the same time by adding multiple cursors and start editing. To insert an extra cursor, simply press Cmd + click (Ctrl + click).12. Check Page PerformancePerformance plays a huge part in web development. You don’t want your users to walk away from your website because it’s too slow. You need to track down what makes your site runs like a snail. How?The answer is in the Performance panel. All you need to do is press Cmd + E (Ctrl + E) and then refresh the page to start recording.13. Force an Element StateAn HTML element has multiple states such as clicked, hovered,… Occasionally, you will want a state to be active without having you actually click or hover on the element. Fortunately, you can force it like below.ConclusionCan you imagine your workday as a web developer without Chrome DevTools? It’ll not easy.The above tips are not all. There’re many other features waiting for you to discover. Or you already know it. So, what are your favorite ones?

Firebase Login System for Google Chrome Extensions,https://medium.com/@anobjectisa/firebase-login-system-for-google-chrome-extensions-27906f973b66?source=tag_archive---------6-----------------------,"Programming,Chrome Extension,Web Development,Google Chrome Extensions,Learn To Code","Offload your login system to Google’s Firebase Authentication SDK.This tutorial uses a boiler-plate Google Chrome Extension setup.If you want to know how to get that setup,Check out my write-up here:How Does A Chrome Extension Work? (Web Development)There are 5 parts to a Chrome extension:medium.comOr the video tutorial here:Let’s Begin.Before we even touch a line of code, we need to setup our development environment.Navigate to ‘https://console.firebase.google.com/' and login.Click ‘Create Project’ and name it.If you need the ‘Analytics’ functionality, choose so.Once the project is created, create a new app by clicking on the ‘Web’ icon.‘Web app’Name this app.If you need the ‘Firebase Hosting’ functionality, choose so.Navigate back to the developer console and click on the ‘Authentication’ card.Click on ‘Sign-in method’ in the navigation bar.Here is where you choose which sign-in options you’ll be giving the user.For this tutorial, we’ll use Google and GitHub.Firebase Sign-in methodsClick on the Google option, enable it, provide a ‘Support email’ and save.Click on the GitHub option and enable it.Copy the ‘callback URL’ from this page.We need to retrieve a ‘Client ID’ and ‘Client secret’ from GitHub’s developer “console”.Navigate to GitHub, click on your user icon and choose Settings.Click on Developer settings > OAuth Apps > Create new application.Name the application whatever you like.The ‘Homepage URL’ can be anything you want.The ‘Authorization callback URL’ is the ‘callback URL’ provided by Firebase.Click ‘Register application’.Copy the ‘Client ID’ and ‘Client secret’ and paste these into your Firebase GitHub option.Scroll down to ‘Add domain’; we need to whitelist our Chrome extension.Add the domain, “chrome-extension://<id>”, where <id> is your Chrome extension id. This can be found @ chrome://extensions/ in your browser.Scroll down to ‘Multiple accounts per email address’. If you want, enable this ability.We can now start with some actual coding.Let’s do some web development work before we get to actual Chrome Extension work.We’ll need three pages.A ‘popup.html’ which we’ll use to give the user ‘sign in’ options.A ‘welcome.html’ which we’ll show to inform the user they’ve been successfully logged in.A ‘main.html’ which we’ll use to give the user the option to ‘sign out’.Note:Take note of all of the ‘scripts’ attached to our HTML files. We’ll fill those out as we go.Now that we have the Web Dev portion out of the way, let’s take a look at our ‘manifest.json’.Note:The “content_security_policy” is essential for this app. It allows Firebase to download its necessary files.Let’s do some actual Chrome Extension programming.We’ll start by coding the basic skeletal logic flow of our app.In the ‘main-script.js’ script, when the user clicks on the diamond, we’ll send a message to the ‘background.js’ script asking to “sign_out”.If we get a “success” from the ‘background.js’ we’ll change the page to the ‘popup.html’ page.// main-script.jsdocument.querySelector('#sign_out').addEventListener('click', () => {    chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ message: 'sign_out' },      function (response) {        if (response.message === 'success') {            window.location.replace('./popup.html');        }    });});In the ‘popup-init.js’ script, we’ll check whether or not the user is currently signed in.If they are, we’ll show them the ‘main.html’ page; if they are not, we’ll show them the ‘popup.html’ page.// popup-init.jsfunction init() {    chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ message: 'is_user_signed_in' },       function (response) {        if (response.message === 'success' && response.payload) {            window.location.replace('./main.html');        }    });}init();The ‘popup-script.js’ is where we’ll do most of our coding.Before that however, we need to download the Firebase SDK’s.So in the ‘popup.html’, we’ll include some ‘scripts’ and ‘links’ in the head.// popup.html<script src=""https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/7.19.1/firebase-app.js""></script><script src=""https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/7.19.1/firebase-auth.js""></script><script src=""https://cdn.firebase.com/libs/firebaseui/3.5.2/firebaseui.js""></script><link type=""text/css"" rel=""stylesheet"" href=""https://cdn.firebase.com/libs/firebaseui/3.5.2/firebaseui.css"" />Let’s get to the ‘popup-script.js’.We’ll be copying and pasting a lot of code fromhttps://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/firebaseuiNavigate to the settings of your Firebase Web App.Scroll down until you find the ‘Firebase SDK snippet’. We just need the ‘Config’.Copy and paste that into your ‘popup-script.js’ and make sure to initialize.// popup-script.jsconst firebaseConfig = {    apiKey: """",    authDomain: """",    databaseURL: """",    projectId: """",    storageBucket: """",    messagingSenderId: """",    appId: """"};firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);Next, we’ll…initialize the ‘Firebase Auth UI’,setup the options for the UI, then start the UI when the user clicks the ‘Sign In’ button.Note:1. In the ‘signInSuccessWithAuthResult: function (authResult, redirectUrl)’ of our ‘uiConfig’, we send a message to ‘background.js’ script informing ourextension that the user has successfully signed in.2. In the ‘uiShown: function()’ we make sure to hide the ‘Sign In’ button.3. We don’t need a value for ‘signInSuccessUrl’ since Chrome doesn’t allow us to redirect back to it.There you have it.

We chose Neumorphism for our app and here is how we did it,https://blog.prototypr.io/we-chose-neumorphism-for-our-app-and-here-is-how-we-did-it-80b0f4c9bc6e?source=tag_archive---------7-----------------------,"Neumorphism,UX Design,UI Design,Web Development,Development","learnbyear.ioNeumorphism (also called Soft UI) started getting traction around end of 2019/beginning of 2020 (so just a bit before the world ended).By this time we have been working on and off for about 2–3 months on our web app (learnbyear.io), we started implementing the logic, figured out the architecture, or at least we thought we did (you can read the “struggles” section in this article), and the project was approaching a point where we wanted to see some tasty visuals.It was New Year’s Eve and the few days off that follow after it when we were having intensive coding sessions and things started getting real. We knew we wanted our app to be simple, straight to the point and the main value of it is the education it gives. It doesn’t come in a form of reading resources nor with video materials, this app is purely based on hearing sounds and mastering your ear skills.Here are the first sketches we laid on a tiny whiteboard in our living room and set the first stone in the path of creating the design for our app.White board sketches of the appSince neumorphism is far from ideal in terms of accessibility, we knew that we had to use it carefully. Defining the main usage of our app and how we would implement the design was crucial. We knew we won’t have a dashboard or a control panel where the user would need to rely on visual feedback, for example like in here:Default and pressed states of a button element with neumorphismImagine you have this button on a video conferencing app to tell you if your video camera is on or off, that’s a bit confusing, isn’t it? Not to mention that users might not even see the subtle difference between the two!While it’s not perfect, it also doesn’t mean that neumorphism is bad and that we need to throw it away, forget and never use it again. It means that we need to adapt it to be functional. In this specific example we could do something like this:Improved default and pressed states of neumorphism buttonsNow you have more elements involved in the visual feedback which is a step forward. By using small alteration like these we figured that we could make it work and that we would be comfortable with using neumorphism in our app. Our first stop was Figma (which was also starting to get some buzz!), where we still have all of our designs, sketches and more.As a former architect, using this kind of programs isn’t new to me, I come from a long list of Adobe, CorelDraw, Autodesk, SketchUp, and friends. Figma to me is a mix of CorelDraw and SketchUp (if we compare interface, simplicity of usage and learning curve), but with a focus on making mocks for the web.So we got Figma (or any other software of your choice) and a design direction, now what?In Neumorphism, the main principe is that the element and the background colour of it are the same colour, you then have 2 additional colours which are essentially just shades of the main one, so you end up with 3 colours — main, shadow, highlight.At that time there was not much information around how to actually create it and use it, it wasn’t being implemented much, many were being apprehensive about using it. I found this YouTube tutorial which helped me to get started. So the first thing I went on doing was this:Neumorphism effect element and colours, light modeIt didn’t take long to assemble this, but coming up with the right colours did. You need to be careful not to go too bright or your highlight effect won’t be visible, but you (or maybe you do, I didn’t) don’t want to go too much into the “colour”, as we wanted to remain as neutral as possible. Also worth mentioning — it took us to actually apply the colours to our web elements to see better which colour works on the page when it’s all together and our Figma canvas was FULL of variations, so if you are struggling in the beginning and can’t decide, just keep going.Oh, yeah, we also knew that we are going to have a dark mode, it wasn’t even an option not to have one, so, please welcome:Neumorphism effect element and colours, dark modeIt has the same pattern — 3 colours — main, highlight, shadow. The only pitfall is, just like with the light mode and its brightness — with the dark mode you cannot go too dark or the shadow won’t be visible and in general, let’s not do pitch black dark modes, they are way too intense.After we got the first drafts of colours, we started creating digital mocks of our pages by combining the sketches from the white board and the colour patterns, here’s how they looked:First digital sketches of the appSo you get the idea, neumorphism was indeed our main design pattern! Now, while some of the parts looked too much 1995, it still gave us a base. Next we were onto creating the colour scheme of our app.We knew we already had 3 colours, but we at least needed 2 more for text and some “helper” colour so we could have some room. The way we set up those colours was again in Figma, similarly to how we chose the 3 main ones, we did the following:Main lesson: you need to name things, otherwise it’ll drive you crazy, will lead to even more confusion and if you need to communicate then it might create misunderstandings. The naming in the example above is by no means an ideal solution either, so — name things right, or the confusion won’t be solved. For example: when suddenly your Grey isn’t really grey or when your Dark looks like other darks it looses its sense.I wrote a whole article about naming those variables and how to translate them into css and use them wisely (in my very humble opinion).Let’s not digress from the neumorphism topic though, apart from the colours above we also knew we would need some others to give a stronger visual feedback if a chosen answer is correct or wrong, and another one, for various purposes, as we called it,- a “pop” colour. Because let’s admit it, it all looks a bit meh so far.Here are the colours we ended up having next:You see the naming has evolved a bit and now we have 3 topics:Text (first two)Elements (following three)Helpers (the rest)If you want to read more about the naming and how to implement it in your app — check this post.Now that we got the colours figured out (although not really, you’re still most likely going to change them, but it’s a start) we can proceed and build some elements!I’ll be showing you examples in one of the modes (dark/light), just to spare the repetitiveness, but you are very much welcomed to check them in live action.First and foremost, we have to change our main page’s background colour to be the same as our main element’s background colour, otherwise the neumorphism effect will be lost.You can see that we are using CSS Variables var(--elements--main) which correspond to the names of the colours we have in Figma.Our main Element of all is the box, which is in its core an html element, mostly a <div>, a <button> or an <a> tag with a css class we named .element__box using the BEM methodology.Here is a snippet of the style:The result:Choosing BEM as our naming methodology wasn’t something we hesitated about. We needed reusable styling (not to confuse with reusable components) and that’s a good method to achieve that. Let me show you what I mean:You see we have the main class defining the general style, and then we have modifiers, such as --round which will result in element__box--round , same goes for element__box--flat and element__box--pressed .Let’s get a closer look, for example let’s take a UI element where we are using element__box--round. One of them is Radial Progress, you can see it in many different places throughout the website and its purpose is to display your progress on a course, exercise and level scopes. You probably have seen it already in the Figma sketches from above, but here are some screenshots from the live app:Yeah, we use it A LOT and I’d dare to say it’s our main round element in the app. Below you can find a snippet of the component’s code.Check out the element__box and element__box--round , found them? We were able to apply it as many times as we needed and we didn't need to duplicate the neumorphism code in each css class.Here is the end result with some progress tracking:Swapped for a dark mode presentation as I think it looks very badass in those colours!All the elements, which aren’t round in the example above, have the same .element__box class! That's how easy it is to convert regular html element to be neumorphism elements with just one class.In a similar way you can assign state to those elements — how will they look on hover, active, focused? And the best best best thing? It’s all being changed in one place but reused everywhere!Here is the full style for the .element__box if you fancy trying it out yourself:.element__box {    color: var(--text--main);    box-shadow:         3px 3px 5px var(--elements--shadow),         -3px -3px 5px var(--elements--highlight);    border-radius: 10px;    background-color: var(--elements--main);    transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out;    // e.g. for circle elements/buttons    &--round {        border-radius: 50%;    }    // no radius (e.g. for 100% width elements)    &--flat {        border-radius: 0;    }    // ""pressed"" effect (similar to an active state for buttons)    &--pressed {        box-shadow:             inset 3px 1px 6px var(--elements--shadow),             inset -2px -5px 10px var(--elements--highlight);        transition: all 0.3s ease-out;    }    // add this class when you want to specify that the element is      interactive    &--interactive {        cursor: pointer;        transition: all 0.1s ease-out;        // - hover        &:hover {            box-shadow:                 5px 5px 15px var(--elements--shadow),                 -5px -5px 15px var(--elements--highlight);            transition: all 0.3s ease-out;        }        // - active(""selected"")        &:active {            box-shadow:                 inset 3px 1px 6px var(--elements--shadow),                 inset -2px -5px 10px var(--elements--highlight);            transition: all 0.3s ease-out;        }    }}Please note, part of accessibility means that semantics of HTML are being respected, regardless of how interactive you can make your element look. In the snippet above you can find an interactive modifier which we're using for links that we want to look like buttons, or when we use an imported from a library component (e.g. accordion from bootstrap) and you need to adjust the styling. So we need to be mindful about modifications and alteration.Speaking of accessibility, in the beginning I mentioned how neumorphism’s buttons aren’t accessible and need to be handled with care when implemented. Let me show you one element:Settings menuThis is the settings menu, when you navigate to any level of any exercise, you have a cog on the top right of the page where you can access your preferences and adjust them. It consists of:Notes intervalKeyboard pianoAuto ContinueDark Mode (this toggle is also present in the navbar on other pages)Notes interval is an input field of a type range, so this is pretty straightforward, doesn’t have much to do with challenging neumorphism’s lack of accessibility. Input range is a massive pain to style by itself already, thus in some browsers you’ll see the thumb being in our “pop” colour, in some — plain. We gave up fighting it and just let it be a wild child.Following that one, we have 3 similar in their functionality elements — they are all toggles, which in their core — are input fields of a type checkbox.This is where we decided to replace the “native” neumorphism buttons and their neutral/pressed statesfor checkboxes that look like toggles, as this is essentially what they are doing — toggling a feature on or off.Usually toggles don’t have text written on them, which was another decision we made in order to make the options more understandable (toggles can be very confusing sometimes!) and, hopefully, increase their usability and improve the overall user experience. We also included our “pop” colour there to indicate an “on” state of the feature, which I think not only helps visually to go through the settings, but also helps enliven the section a bit.Of course our app is far from being 100% accessible, there is still a lot to learn in that field but I still would like to encourage everyone who develops (be it software or web or anything for that matter) to think about every user, not only about the able bodied ones.As you can see with just small tweaks we were able to make neumorphism more accessible. Trends are cool but they aren’t worth much if a very limited amount of people can enjoy them. Also, why wouldn’t you want to make it possible for everyone to use your product?In conclusion, neumorphism was named many things and diagnosed with a very short life span, but nevertheless we took it on a journey and enjoyed working with it, a lot, although at times not without a challenge.If you’re thinking of using neumorphism, here are some main points we would recommend to keep in mind:Cons:colour selection (not too white, not too yellow/blue, not too dark) can be a painweak accessibilitydesign inconsistencies are more visible (keep your paddings and margins in line!)3 core colours can be challenging, need to be simple but not boringPros:easy to start working with as it can be used in a very modular wayyou shouldn’t get into trouble by using too many colours and them not matchingaesthetics (but that’s for each their own taste)Those points are based on designing and building an app with neumorphism as a style and while subjective, reflect the lessons/struggles we have experienced while working on it.Thank you for reading!Written by_danascript_Full-stack Web Developer who is unapologetically breaking stereotypes and boundaries in tech while advocating for womxn and juniorsFollow163 1 Sign up for By Design.By PrototyprStay in the loop with the design industry - get weekly digests of news, stories and tools. Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

How to Transform a Frontend Project Into a Chrome Extension,https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/how-to-transform-a-frontend-project-into-a-chrome-extension-675d0821cc6d?source=tag_archive---------8-----------------------,"JavaScript,Front End Development,Chrome,Web Development,Programming","The Chrome extension can greatly extend the functions of Chrome and has a huge market and commercial value. As a front-end programmer, can you write a Chrome extension?Chrome extensions are written using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and we don’t need to learn a new development language. Every front-end developer can easily transform their existing project into a Chrome extension project.Suppose we now have a very simple front-end project in which there is currently only one index.html file. This file is used to display the current system time:Okay, so let’s get started with transforming this very simple front-end project into a Chrome extension.manifest.jsonChrome specifies that all extension projects must have a manifest.json file in the root directory, which identifies an extension project and performs various configurations.Now let’s add a manifest file to the root directory of the project and write the following.{  ""name"": ""My Extension"",  ""version"": ""1.0"",  ""manifest_version"": 2,  ""browser_action"": {    ""default_popup"": ""index.html""  }}The name field declares the name of our extension, which will be the name of your extension if you upload it to the Chrome Web Store in the future. version is the version number of our project. The manifest_version is what the version number of our manifest file is, and so far this value is always 2.The browser_action field is used to configure our extension’s behaviors. When we click on the extension in Chrome, we open the rendered page from the HTML file corresponding to default_popup.The GIF below is what the extension looks like for now.Install ExtensionWith the configuration complete, we are now ready to install the extension we just wrote into Chrome browser so that we can test the project.There are three steps to installing a extension:open chrome://extensions/turn developer mode onunpload unpack projectHTML ScriptCareful readers may have noticed that JavaScript scripts in HTML are not executed.We have this script in our HTML file:<script type=""text/javascript"">    let interval = setInterval(() => {      document.getElementById(""localTime"")        .innerText = new Date().toString()    }, 1000);</script>But this code is not executed. This is because Chrome dictates that JavaScript scripts from HTML files in extensions can only be placed in separate files, not embedded in HTML files. So we need to create an extra .js file and put the JavaScript code there.And in the HTML file, we cam simply reference this code.At this point, we’re reloading our extension, and we can see that the JavaScript script is working properly.Click this to reload extensionThe script works.iconNext, let’s add a nice looking icon to the extension.First we prepare an image and then put it into the project.Next we need to configure the manifest file to declare our logo. So to be specific, we could write it this way:The default_icon field is used to declare icons. Now refresh our extension and you will see that the logo has changed.The background scriptOne of the drawbacks of previous JavaScript scripts is that they don’t start running until the user clicks on the extension icon. But a lot of times, we want the script to start executing as soon as the user starts the browser, so what do we do?First, let’s simply write a new script:alert(""Hello! -- from background/main.js"")setTimeout(()=>{  alert(""Hi! -- from background/main.js"")}, 2000)Then configure the manifest file.The background/script field is used to configure the script to run in the background. It is an array that can be configured with multiple files running in the background.Next, let’s reload the extension and test how it works.it works.Content ScriptSometimes we want extensions that execute scripts after the user has opened a web page. For example, when the user opens Medium.com, “Hello Medium” will pop up. When a user opens GitHub.com, “Hi, GitHub” pops up.To do that, we need to use content script. Conten script is a script that is executed only when the user opens certain web pages.Let’s start by writing two simple script files.Then configure the manifest file.""content_scripts"": [    {      ""matches"": [""*://medium.com/*""],      ""js"": [""content/medium.com.js""]    }, {      ""matches"": [""*://github.com/*""],      ""js"": [""content/github.com.js""]    }  ]""*://medium.com/*” will match any page on the Medium, so when we open any Medium page, “content/medium.com.js” will be executed.""*://github.com/*” will match any page on the GitHub, so when we open any GitHub page, “content/github.com.js” will be executed.ConclusionWell, this article covers the basics of developing Chrome extensions, and now you can turn one of your own front-end projects into a Chrome extension.The source code for the project is available on GitHub:bitfishxyz/ChromeExtensionDemoContribute to bitfishxyz/ChromeExtensionDemo development by creating an account on GitHub.github.comJavaScript In Plain EnglishNew JavaScript + Web Development articles every day.Follow118 JavaScriptFront End DevelopmentChromeWeb DevelopmentProgramming118 claps118 clapsWritten bybitfishFollowLove reading, writing and programming.FollowJavaScript In Plain EnglishFollowNew JavaScript + Web Development articles every day.FollowWritten bybitfishFollowLove reading, writing and programming.JavaScript In Plain EnglishFollowNew JavaScript + Web Development articles every day.More From MediumHow to Solve LeetCode 1539: Kth Missing Positive Number in JavaScriptSaul Feliz in The StartupHow to create themes for your Angular 7 apps using CSS VariablesStephen McLean in freeCodeCamp.orgCross-platform Apps with Electron and React Part 1Marco Laspe in Better ProgrammingWhat’s New in React v17?Harsha Vardhan in Better ProgrammingUnderstanding Higher order functions in Javascriptaditya dhanraj tiwari in Code ShinobisHow to Avoid Prop Drilling with CompositionJustin Travis Waith-Mair in The Non-Traditional Developer20 Methods to Get to Know JavaScript Array OperationsJavascript Jeep🚙💨 in Better ProgrammingA Front-End's (good) impressions about ElixirEve Montalvão in Inside SumUpLearn more.Medium is an open platform where 170 million readers come to find insightful and dynamic thinking."
How To Build Airbnb Clone in React,https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/how-to-build-airbnb-clone-in-react-70265acf5159?source=tag_archive---------9-----------------------,"JavaScript,Programming,Web Development,React,Elasticsearch","Hello readers!Today in this article we will see how to build an Airbnb Clone using React and Elastic. As we all familiar already about what is React?. Let’s see about little bit of Elastic Search.Elastic search is a super fast open source search engine. It is used to store, search and analyze high volume of data fastly.Using Elastic search we can build a fast searching query DSL. To set up elastic search correctly requires a lot of work. In Elastic search the data mapping should be set correctly. We can add more filters along with the search query resulting in search query.How to use Elastic search with React?We are going to use ReactiveSearch an open-source components library for Elastic search. It provides a highly customizable UI components that connects with Elastic search server and provide an appropriate default search query for all use-cases.Let’s build an searchbox UI example using Elastic search by the following code:<DataSearch    componentId=""search""    dataField=""name""    placeholder=""Search housings...""    iconPosition=""left""/>PrerequisitesTo build an Airbnb like application we need set of things to gets started:Data set for Airbnb housing properties.Elastic search hosting.I have created a data set for our application. You can checkout this:SetupTo get started use the Create React App command in your local terminal. And then use yarn to import modules instead of npm.yarn global add create-react-appcreate-react-app airbedscd airbedsyarn startAt this point, your directory structure look like this:airbeds├── README.md├── node_modules├── package.json├── .gitignore├── yarn.lock├── public│   └── favicon.ico│   └── index.html│   └── manifest.json└── src    └── App.css    └── App.js    └── App.test.js    └── index.css    └── index.js    └── logo.svg    └── registerServiceWorker.jsNext install ReactiveSearch by following command:yarn add @appbaseio/reactivesearch@2.16.1Add the first ReactiveSearch component to ReactiveBaseAdd all the ReactiveSearch components inside a container component that includes the Elastic search index and the ReactiveSearch component in /src/App.js:import React, { Component } from 'react';import { ReactiveBase } from '@appbaseio/reactivesearch';class App extends Component {  render() {    return (      <section className=""container"">        <ReactiveBase          app=""housing""          credentials=""0aL1X5Vts:1ee67be1-9195-4f4b-bd4f-a91cd1b5e4b5""          type=""listing""        >          Hello from ReactiveSearch!        </ReactiveBase>      </section>    );  }}export default App;Adding UI ComponentsFirst add the calender UI that allows the users to select the range of accommodation. The following code looks like this:componentid is an important prop that requires unique string to identify component.dataField props is used to set the data that the user Search for the query either string or array of strings.queryFormat is used to set the date format for the DateRange component.Now the NumberBox UI code looks like this:import { NumberBox } from '@appbaseio/reactivesearch';<NumberBox    componentId=""GuestSensor""    dataField=""accommodates""    title=""Guests""    defaultSelected={2}    data={{        start: 1,        end: 16    }}/>Then the price filter is used for the customer to filter the accomodation based on their budget.import { RangeSlider } from '@appbaseio/reactivesearch';<RangeSlider    componentId=""PriceSensor""    dataField=""price""    title=""Price Range""    range={{        start: 10,        end: 250    }}    rangeLabels={{        start: ""$10"",        end: ""$250""    }}    defaultSelected={{        start: 10,        end: 50    }}    stepValue={10}    react={{        and: [""DateRangeSensor""]    }}/>Now we have created a RangeSlider that controls the slider bounds. It is used for add labels and select the ranges.We are using new prop to update the price dynamically depending upon the selected date and number of guests.Now we have to create Airbnb card to show the search results:import { ResultCard } from '@appbaseio/reactivesearch';<ResultCard    componentId=""SearchResult""    dataField=""name""    from={0}    size={10}    onData={this.onData}    pagination={true}    react={{        and: [""GuestSensor"", ""PriceSensor"", ""DateRangeSensor""]    }}/>Now by using all the props in our project the ResultCard data prop is used as callback function to return mapping between the ResultCard elements in our database. Now onData method code looks like this:onData(data) {    return {        image: data.image,        title: data.name,        description: (            <div>                <div className=""price"">${data.price}</div>                <p className=""info"">{data.room_type} · {data.accommodates} guests</p>            </div>        ),        url: data.listing_url,    };}We are returning an object that maps to the images, titles and descriptions to the card layout from the database in JSX.Combining The ElementsNow combine all these components together in the src/App.js file.

You can able to see the sliding function and search results. The only thing missing is an layout and style arrangements.Adding styles and layoutsNow add the styles and layouts by adding the following codes in App.css and import it to the App.js file..container {  display: flex;  padding-top: 52px;}.container .nav {  width: 100%;  position: fixed;  top: 0;  left: 0;  z-index: 1;  display: flex;  justify-content: center;  align-items: center;  background-color: #FF3A4E;  color: #fff;  height: 52px;  padding: 0 25px;}.container .left-col {  width: 320px;  height: 100%;  padding: 15px 20px;  position: fixed;  left: 0;  right: 0;  border-right: 1px solid #f0f0f0;}.container .left-col > div {  margin: 40px 0;}@media all and (max-width: 768px) {  .container .left-col {    position: static;    width: 100%;    height: auto;    border-right: 0;    border-bottom: 1px solid #f0f0f0;  }}.container .right-col {  width: calc(100% - 320px);  position: relative;  left: 320px;  padding: 25px 30px;  background-color: #fbfbfb;}.container .right-col .list {  margin-bottom: 30px;}.container .right-col .list-item {  max-width: none;  min-width: 0;  width: calc(30% - 16px);  height: auto;  background-color: transparent;  border: 0;  border-radius: 0;  box-shadow: none;  position: relative;  padding: 0;}.container .right-col .list-item h2 {  padding-bottom: 4px;}.container .right-col .list-item .image {  background-size: cover;}.container .right-col .list-item .price {  width: 70px;  height: 44px;  background-color: #424242;  position: absolute;  top: 160px;  left: 0;  color: #fafafa;  font-size: 18px;  display: flex;  justify-content: center;  align-items: center;  letter-spacing: 0.03rem;}.container .right-col .list-item .info {  color: #555;  font-size: 14px;  margin-bottom: 4px;}.container .right-col .result-stats {  text-align: right;  color: #666;  font-size: 15px;}@media all and (min-width: 1441px) {  .container .right-col .list-item {    width: calc(25% - 16px);  }}@media all and (max-width: 1024px) {  .container .right-col .list-item {    width: calc(50% - 16px);  }}@media all and (max-width: 768px) {  .container .right-col {    width: 100%;    position: static;    padding: 25px 15px;  }}@media all and (max-width: 480px) {  .container .right-col .list-item {    width: calc(100% - 16px);    margin-bottom: 20px;  }}Final resultConclusionI hope you enjoyed a lot and now you will know how to build Airbnb UI using React. You can add some more features like authentication, add more search box and sorting the different orders.Thanks for reading!JavaScript In Plain EnglishDid you know that we have three publications and a YouTube channel?

What’s new in JavaScript 2020?,https://medium.com/jspoint/whats-new-in-javascript-2020-a2e19250a774?source=tag_archive---------10-----------------------,"Javascrit,Ecmascript,ES6,Node,Web Development","(source: unsplash.com)As we know, when an ECMAScript proposal reaches stage 4, it is ready to be included in the ECMAScript standard and browsers can start implementing it in their JavaScript engines. The following table shows the stages a proposal has to go through until it is finally landed in the hands of the public.(source: gist.github.com)In 2019, I published the article “What’s new in JavaScript: Google I/O 2019 Summary” about the new JavaScript featured landed in 2019. Not sure if I can call it “popular” but it gained some good traction among JavaScript developers and I thought, why not do the same for the year 2020.Though Google I/O 2020 has been canceled, it doesn’t stop the ECMAScript (JavaScript standard) development process. This year, we are expected to see some cool new JavaScript features coming to browsers and Node. Some of these features are pretty new and might not be available in your browser, so use Firefox 80 or Chrome 85 to test them out or use Babel plugins.Optional ChainingWe have abused && operator to get around a few sneaky things. As we know, JavaScript objects can be nested, and accessing the nested property isn’t always runtime safe operation. Let me show you how.(source: gist.github.com)In the above example, the object obj is a plain JavaScript object but it is deeply nested. So accessing the value of the property p would need the traversal of it obj > a > b > c > p. Let’s what happens if any path is missing.▶ obj.a.b.c.p◁ 1▶ obj.a.b.d.p◁ undefined▶ obj.a.b.e.p◁ Uncaught TypeError: obj.a.b.e is null▶ obj.a.b.f.p◁ Uncaught TypeError: obj.a.b.f is undefinedSo in the first case, accessing obj.a.b.c.p returned 1 because it’s a valid path. Accessing property p on obj.a.b.d was also a success since obj.a.b.d is a number which also kind-of an object as we can access properties on it.However, we can’t access properties on null and undefined since they are not objects. These together are called the nullish value. Whenever you try to access properties on a nullish value, JavaScript will throw a TypeError.So how can we circumnavigate this? Well, we could use if/else statement to check if a property is non-nullish and travel deep.if(obj.a){  if(obj.a.b){    if(obj.a.b.f){      console.log( obj.a.b.f.p );    }  }}In the above snippet, we are checking if every ancestor of the property p is not nullish. Since obj.a.b.f would return undefined, the inner console.log statement would not be evaluated, therefore no TypeError.However, there is a more popular way to achieve the same.▶ obj.a && obj.a.b && obj.a.b.c && obj.a.b.c.p◁  1▶ obj.a && obj.a.b && obj.a.b.f && obj.a.b.f.p◁  undefined▶ obj.a && obj.a.b && obj.a.b.e && obj.a.b.e.p◁  nullThe Logical AND operator (&&) in JavaScript works in a very unexpected manner as you can see above. JavaScript evaluates the expressions separated by && from left to right until one expression returns a falsy value. At that point, JavaScript will no longer evaluate the next expressions and return the value of the entire expression (line) would be that falsy value.If however, no expression returns a falsy value, then the returned value would be the value returned by the last expression. Hence, the first expression (line) returned 1 and the last expression obj.a.b.c.p was evaluated. However, the second expression (line) returned undefined, since obj.a.b.f returns undefined (as property f is missing on b) which is a falsy value. You can apply the same logic for the third expression (line).💡 In JavaScript, a value falsy value when it is passed to the Boolean function and the expression returns false. Therefore, false, 0, undefined, null, """" and NaN are falsy values. When a falsy value appears in if statement (parenthesis), that if block won’t be evaluated.However, there is a huge problem with using if statement as well as && operator to safely access nested properties. Since if statement as well as the && operator short-circuits after falsy values, we can’t access properties on an empty string ("""") or 0 since they are falsy. Let’s take an example.(source: gist.github.com)In the above example, the value of property d and e are falsy values, however, we should be able to access properties on them.▶ obj.a && obj.a.b && obj.a.b.d && obj.a.b.d.length◁  """"▶ obj.a && obj.a.b && obj.a.b.e && obj.a.b.e.toFixed◁  0Well, this was a disappointment. Every string has the length property that returns the number of characters (UTF-16 code units) in that string while every number has toFixed property which is a function to format the number. The first expression (line) returns """" because obj.a.b.d evaluated to """" which is falsy and the second expression (line) returns 0 because obj.a.b.e evaluated to 0 which is also falsy.So what’s the solution. Well, JavaScript now supports optional chaining (.?) operator. We can use this operator in the place of . while accessing the property on an object. For example, obj?.a?.b?.f?.p returns undefined.The .? operator checks if the previous value (on its left side) is nullish (null or undefined). If it is, then it short-circuits the whole expression and returns undefined without moving forward. If not, then it will keep moving forward until some nullish value is encountered, else the property value is returned.▶ obj?.a?.b?.c?.p◁ 1▶ obj?.a?.b?.d?.p◁ undefined▶ obj?.a?.b?.e?.p◁ undefined▶ obj?.a?.b?.f?.p◁ undefinedNow in the above example, we did not encounter any TypeError exceptions since JavaScript did not execute e?.p and f?.p parts of the above expression since the property e is null and the property f is undefined (nullish).We do not necessarily need to replace every . with ?. but that could lead to the same problem as before. For example, obj?.a.b?.f?.p would technically work in our case, but it would fail when the property b doesn’t exist on a.When it comes to uses cases, there are many possibilities with the optional chaining operator (?.) just beside accessing the property safely. Let’s understand different syntax and different uses cases.▶ obj?.a?.['b']?.c?.p◁ 1In the above case, we used square-bracket notation ?.['b'] instead of simply ?.b. This could be useful when the property name is stored in a variable or returned from an expression such as a function call.💡 Since ?. do not evaluate any expression on its RHS if the LHS value is nullish, any expression in the square-brackets will not be evaluated. For example, the i in obj?.a?.[++i] will not be incremented if obj or obj.a is nullish.We can also use this operator to conditionally execute a method (function property) if that method exists on the object. For example, the method b will only execute in the expression obj?.a?.b() if a is not nullish. However, if b is nullish, then it will result in a TypeError exception. For that, we use the obj?.a?.b?.() expression. So the function call is only made when b is not nullish (but results in TypeError if b is not a function).Though it wasn’t the intension of this proposal, but we can use delete operator in conjugation with the optional chaining operator to achieve some cool effects. Since delete operator evaluates an expression that should return a property reference, the optional chaining operator can conditionally provide that reference for non-nullish properties.⊙ var obj = {};▶ delete obj.a.b◁ Uncaught TypeError: obj.a is undefined▶ delete obj?.a?.b◁ trueThe first expression delete obj.a.b would attempt to delete b even if the value of property a is nullish which would return in a TypeError. But the second expression does not throw and returns true since obj?.a?.b doesn’t return a property reference.Though it might sound tempting to do something like new Person?.() or obj?.a?.b = 3, but these expressions are not valid. This proposal has explicitly mentioned these points in the proposal document, check here.🐞 [proposal] [support] [babel-plugin]Nullish Coalescing OperatorLike the && operator (Logical AND), we have || operator which is called Logical OR operator since it performs logic OR operation between LHS and RHS. As && operator short circuits when a falsy value found and returns the value of the last executed expression, the || operator short circuits when a truthy value is found and returns the value of the last expression, else the value of the last expression is returned.💡 A truthy value is a value that is not falsy.▶ 0 && ""hello"" && 1◁ 0▶ 0 || ""hello"" || 1◁ ""hello""▶ 0 || """" || NaN◁ NaNIn the above example, the first expression (line) returns 0 as the first value is falsy so the && operator short circuits and returns that value. However, in the second case (line), || operator does not short circuit until ""hello"" since it is a truthy value. In the third example, the last falsy value is returned.This is all well and good. But the problem comes when we want to use it to fall back to a default value. For example, let’s imagine you have some uninitialized variables and you want to select one of them.⊙ i = undefined, j = undefined;▶ i || j || 1◁ 1⊙ j = 0▶ i || j || 1◁ 1So let’s talk about the problem. Here in the example above, we have defined variables i and j with the initial value of undefined. So basically, i and j are falsy at the moment and nullish at the same time since they are undefined. Here, 1 is acting as the default value if i and j are undefined.So the result of the expression i || j || 1 returns the value of 1 (last value) since i and j are undefined. However later down the program, we assigned 0 to j, so technically speaking, j has a value now. However since 0 is falsy, just like undefined, the expression i || j || 1 still returns the same result (last value of 1). Ideally, we need the return value of 0.This problem is more apparent when we want to fall back on a default value when an object property is missing or its value is nullish.(source: gist.github.com)In the above example, property d and e are falsy but they exist on the nested object c and they are not nullish. However, they are falsy. Why that is important? I will come to that. Also, the property f is not present in c, so accessing f on c would return undefined which is a nullish value.▶ obj?.a?.b?.c || ""default""◁ {p: 1}▶ obj?.a?.b?.c?.p || ""default""◁ 1▶ obj?.a?.b?.f || ""default""◁ ""default""▶ obj?.a?.b?.f?.p || ""default""◁ ""default""▶ obj?.a?.b?.d || ""default""◁ ""default""▶ obj?.a?.b?.d?.p || ""default""◁ ""default""▶ obj?.a?.b?.e || ""default""◁ ""default""Let’s hold our breath and go through these expressions one at a time.The obj?.a?.b?.c || “default” returns {p: 1} because obj?.a?.b?.c expression returns {p: 1} and since this is a plain JavaScript object, it is a truthy value and || operator short circuits and returns it.The same logic can be applied to the obj?.a?.b?.c?.p property path does exist and its value is 1 which is a truthy value. Therefore, the expression obj?.a?.b?.c?.p || “default” returns 1 back.The obj?.a?.b?.f and obj?.a?.b?.f?.p path doesn’t exist. Therefore, the optional chaining operator ?. safely returns undefined and undefined || ""default"" returns ""default"" since undefined is a falsy value and ""default"" is a truthy value (not that it matters in this case).Cool! Well, hold on. The expression obj?.a?.b?.d || “default” returns ""default"". That’s expected as obj?.a?.b?.d returns """" (empty string) which is falsy but it’s a problem in practical use cases. I want to fall back to a default value only when the property is missing or nullish.The same logic is applied to obj?.a?.b?.e since it returns is 0 which is falsy value. If I set e to false and use the expression obj?.a?.b?.e || true, it would return true as the value false is falsy.This is a huge problem and if you are a seasoned JavaScript developer then you know how problematic this can get. To circumnavigate this, we need to use all the tricks up our sleeves but we now have a native solution.The ?? operator called the Nullish Coalescing Operator works just like || operator (Logical OR) but it short circuits on non-nullish values. Let that sink in because that’s what it is designed to do.⊙ i = undefined, j = undefined;▶ i ?? j ?? 1◁ 1⊙ j = 0▶ i ?? j ?? 1◁ 0In the above example, i ?? j ?? 1 returns 1 because both i and j are nullish since their values are undefined. Therefore undefined ?? undefined ?? 1 returns 1. However, after setting j=0, j is no longer nullish, therefore i ?? j ?? 1 returns 0 since undefined ?? 0 ?? 1 short circuits at j and value of j is returned.So if try the earlier object properties example, we will now get satisfactory results. Let’s retry that again.▶ obj?.a?.b?.c ?? ""default""◁ {p: 1}▶ obj?.a?.b?.c?.p ?? ""default""◁ 1▶ obj?.a?.b?.f ?? ""default""◁ ""default""▶ obj?.a?.b?.f?.p ?? ""default""◁ ""default""▶ obj?.a?.b?.d ?? ""default""◁ """"▶ obj?.a?.b?.d?.p ?? ""default""◁ ""default""▶ obj?.a?.b?.e ?? ""default""◁ 0So the difference in results of the above program from the earlier one where || operator was used is with the expression obj?.a?.b?.d ?? “default” which returns """" since the value of obj?.a?.b?.d is """" (non-nullish) and with the obj?.a?.b?.e ?? “default” which returns 0 since the value of obj?.a?.b?.e is 0 which again is non-nullish.🐞 [proposal] [support] [babel-plugin]Logical Assignment OperatorsJavaScript is loaded with a ton of operators some of which are arithmetic assignment operators such as +=, -=, *=, /= and %= among many. Let’s see some examples of these operators in action.💡 BTW, we are getting new ** and **= exponent operators in JavaScript just like in Python. This proposal has reached stage 3.⊙ var i = 2;▶ i -= 1         // i = 2 - 1 (i = i - 1)◁ 1▶ i += 2         // i = 1 + 2 (i = i + 1)◁ 3▶ i *= 2         // i = 3 * 2 (i = i * 1)◁ 6▶ i /= 2         // i = 6 / 2 (i = i / 1)◁ 3▶ i %= 2         // i = 3 % 2 (i = i % 1)◁ 1The operator i -= 1 expands to i = i — 1 at runtime as shown in the comments. Focus on one more thing here. In JavaScript, assignment expression returns the assigned value. Hence the expression i -= 1 returns 1 because the value assigned to i was i — 1 which is 1.💡 JavaScript also has the comma operator. It is just like || except it doesn’t short circult and returns the value of the last expression. For example, the expression (0, 1, false, 3) returns 3. Hence var x = (0, 1, false, 3) assigns 3 to x. Read more about this on MDN.We have these arithmetic assignment operators in JavaScript since the stone age and so does the Logical OR (||) and Logical AND (&&) operators. But we didn’t have logical assignment operators such as Logical OR assignment (||=) and Logical AND assignment (&&=) operators until now.The Logical OR assignment operator ||= might seem just like += but it expands in a different fashion and so does the Logical AND assignment (&&=) operator. Let’s see how.▶ i += j       ->     i = i + j▶ i ||= j      ->     i || (i = j)▶ i &&= j      ->     i && (i = j)As you can see with the += operator, it expands into an assignment expression where the variable i will always be assigned with some value and the same goes for all arithmetic assignment operators.However, that’s not the case with the expression i ||= j. Here the assignment expression expands to i || (i = j) which only assign value to i if the initial value of i is falsy. If i is falsy, (i = j) will be executed and this expression returns the value assigned to i which is j, therefore the entire expression i || (i = j) returns the value assigned to i. If i is truthy, this expression returns the value of i.⊙ var i = undefined;▶ i ||= 0         // i || (i = 0) -> undefined || (i = 0)◁ 0 (assignment success)▶ i ||= 1         // i || (i = 1) -> 0 || (i = 1)◁ 1 (assignment success)▶ i ||= 2         // i || (i = 2) -> 1 || (i = 2)◁ 1 (assignment failed)In the above example, the last assignment fails because at that point the value of i is truthy where the || operator short circuits.The same logic can be applied to the Logical AND assignment (&&=) operator. In this case, the assignment will only work when the initial value of the variable is truthy. Let’s see an example.⊙ var i = undefined;▶ i &&= 0         // i && (i = 0) -> undefined && (i = 0)◁ undefined (assignment failed)⊙ i = 0▶ i &&= 1         // i && (i = 1) -> 0 && (i = 1)◁ 0 (assignment failed)⊙ i = 1▶ i &&= 2         // i && (i = 2) -> 1 && (i = 2)◁ 2 (assignment success)In the above example, only the last assignment expression worked since the value of i at that point is truthy and the && operator doesn’t short circuit.Well, you could ask, what if I want to assign a value to a variable only when that variable is null or undefined. This is a valid argument because technically 0, false, """" and NaN is a valid value. So this proposal also brought us the Logical Nullish assignment (??=) operator.⊙ var i = undefined;▶ i ??= 0         // i ?? (i = 0) -> undefined ?? (i = 0)◁ 0 (assignment success)▶ i ??= 1         // i ?? (i = 1) -> 0 ?? (i = 1)◁ 0 (assignment failed)▶ i ??= 2         // i ?? (i = 2) -> 0 ?? (i = 2)◁ 0 (assignment failed)In the above case, the expression i ??= 0 resulted in the assignment of 0 to i because at that point, i was undefined which is a nullish value and ?? operator doesn’t short circuit. However, after that, the value of i is 0 which is non-nullish which means i ?? expr will result in i always. Hence the assignment expression i ??= 1 and i ??= 2 did not succeed as the value of i is 0 (non-nullish) and ?? operator short circuited.🐞 [proposal] [support] [babel-plugin]String.prototype.replaceAllWe all have used .replace() prototype function on a string value to replace some characters in the string with another string using a string match or a regular expression pattern. Let me show you how.⊙ var str = ""Hello World! This World seems nice."";▶ str.replace( ""World"", ""Universe"" )◁ ""Hello Universe! This World seems nice.""The String.prototype.replace method does not mutate the string data (as strings are immutable) but returns a new string by replacing the match with the replacement. Here the match is ""World"" which is a string and replacement is ""Universe"" which also is a string.💡 The String.prototype.replace method provides far more functionalities than just replacing a string with another string, such as substituting the matched string (target) in the replacement string using $& placeholder. Check the MDN documentation to know more about this.However, look at the returned string value of the .replace() call in the above example. It only replaced one ""World"" word with the ""Universe"". Is that a mistake? Actually, not. The .replace() method only replace the first occurrence of the target when the target is a string.To replace multiple occurrences, we need to use a Regular Expression object with the global flag g turned on. Let’s modify the earlier example.⊙ var str = ""Hello World! This World seems nice."";▶ str.replace( /World/g, ""Universe"" )◁ ""Hello Universe! This Universe seems nice.""Well, now we have replaced all the occurrences of the “World” matched by the /World/g pattern with the ""Universe"". However, we had to use a regular expression to do that which is a little inconvenient.Hence we now have String.prototype.replaceAll prototype method natively in JavaScript. This method work just like .replace() but it will replace all the occurrences of the target instead of just the first one.⊙ var str = ""Hello World! This World seems nice."";▶ str.replaceAll( ""World"", ""Universe"" )◁ ""Hello Universe! This Universe seems nice.""So we didn’t have to use a regular expression to replace all the occurrences of the word ""World"" in the string which is super convenient. But we can also use the regular expression with .replaceAll just like .replace however with one caveat. Since .replaceAll supposed to replace all occurrences, a regular expression without g flags throws a TypeError exception.⊙ var str = ""Hello World! This World seems nice."";▶ str.replace( ""World"", ""Universe"" )◁ ""Hello Universe! This World seems nice.""▶ str.replace( /World/, ""Universe"" )◁ ""Hello Universe! This World seems nice.""▶ str.replace( /World/g, ""Universe"" )◁ ""Hello Universe! This Universe seems nice.""▶ str.replaceAll( ""World"", ""Universe"" )◁ ""Hello Universe! This Universe seems nice.""▶ str.replaceAll( /World/g, ""Universe"" )◁ ""Hello Universe! This Universe seems nice.""▶ str.replaceAll( /World/, ""Universe"" )◁ Uncaught TypeError: String.prototype.replaceAll called with a non-global RegExp argument🐞 [proposal] [support] [polyfill]Promise.anyIn 2019, we received Promise.allSettled static method that returns a promise which resolves when all promises are settled (either resolved or rejected). We talked about this in the earlier lesson. This year, we have received Promise.any static method. This method is similar to Promise.race method with some exceptions.The Promise.race is racing input promise until one gives a result. The result could be the resolution or rejection of the promise. Hence once one of the input promises settles, the promise returned by the Promise.race() resolves or rejects with the value of the first settled promise.⊙ const delayed = ( id, success, time = 0 ) => {  return new Promise( ( resolve, reject ) => {    setTimeout( () => {      success ? resolve( `🟢 ${id}` ) : reject( `🔴 ${id}` )    }, time );  } );}▶ Promise.race( [  delayed( 'A', true, 1000 ),  delayed( 'B', true, 500 ),  delayed( 'C', false, 1500 ),] ).then( (result) => console.log('success ->', result) ).catch( (result) => console.log('failure ->', result) );◁ success -> 🟢 BIn the above example, the delayed function returns a promise that either resolves or rejects based on the success argument after some time based on the time argument. So the result of Promise.race in the above is a promise that resolves when one of the input promises A, B or C either resolves first or rejects when one of the input promises rejects first.In the above example, the returned promise resolves with the resolved value of B since it resolves first among others. If it rejects then we would get the promise rejection with the rejected values as shown below.▶ Promise.race( [  delayed( 'A', true, 1000 ),  delayed( 'B', false, 500 ),  delayed( 'C', false, 1500 ),] ).then( (result) => console.log('success ->', result) ).catch( (result) => console.log('failure ->', result) );◁ failure -> 🔴 BThis is working as expected but sometimes we need the value of the first resolved promise, not the value of the first settled promise. For example, if you want to make sure that the user always gets a network response, then you would call three different API endpoints to get the same response and serve the response of the first API that returned a success status (just an example).This is where Promise.any comes in. This method works in the exact same manner as Promise.race but the promise returned by this method resolves when the first input promise successfully resolved with its resolved value.When none of the input promises resolves (when all are rejected), this method throws an error of the type AggregateError. This error will be caught by the catch method or the catch block if you are using the try/catch with the async/await syntax.▶ Promise.any( [  delayed( 'A', true, 1000 ),  delayed( 'B', false, 500 ),  delayed( 'C', true, 1500 ),] ).then( (result) => console.log('success ->', result) ).catch( (result) => console.log('failure ->', result) );◁ success -> 🟢 AIn the above example, though the promise B settles first but since it is rejected, Promise.any kept on waiting until other pending promises resolve. Since the promise A a successfully resolves after 1s, it will resolve immediately (after 1s) with the value of the promise A.However, when all promises are rejected, the AggregateError error is thrown which contains the reason for the rejection.▶ Promise.any( [  delayed( 'A', false, 1000 ),  delayed( 'B', false, 500 ),  delayed( 'C', false, 1500 ),] ).then( (result) => console.log('success ->', result) ).catch( (result) => console.log('failure ->', result) );◁ failure -> AggregateError: All promises were rejected🐞 [proposal] [support] [polyfill]If you want to know how promises work in TypeScript, here is the lesson.A quick introduction to “Promises” and “Async/Await” (with new features)In this lesson, we are going to learn about ES6 Promises implementation in TypeScript and async/await syntax.medium.com(thatisuday.com / GitHub / Twitter/ StackOverflow / Instagram)JsPointJavaScript and the WebFollow12 Some rights reservedJavascritEcmascriptES6NodeWeb Development12 claps12 clapsWritten byUday HiwaraleFollowSenior Software Engineer (JS • Go • Dart • Python) / thatisuday.com ☯ github.com/thatisuday ☯ thatisuday@gmail.comFollowJsPointFollowA collection of essential articles for JavaScript, WebAssembly, TypeScript, Node.js, Deno, and Web development in general.FollowWritten byUday HiwaraleFollowSenior Software Engineer (JS • Go • Dart • Python) / thatisuday.com ☯ github.com/thatisuday ☯ thatisuday@gmail.comJsPointFollowA collection of essential articles for JavaScript, WebAssembly, TypeScript, Node.js, Deno, and Web development in general.More From MediumA basic introduction to Fabric.js to draw 2D graphics on WebUday Hiwarale in JsPointA minimal guide to JavaScript (ECMAScript) Decorators and Property Descriptor of the ObjectUday Hiwarale in JsPointPug.js to make your life easier with HTML templatesUday Hiwarale in JsPointHow to write a frontend JavaScript plugin using ES6 + SASS + WebpackUday Hiwarale in JsPointWhat’s new in JavaScript: Google I/O 2019 SummaryUday Hiwarale in JsPointWorking with Axios and RxJS to make simple HTTP libraryUday Hiwarale in JsPointJavaScript rAF in a nutshell (requestAnimationFrame)Uday Hiwarale in JsPointA brief introduction to Metaprogramming in JavaScriptUday Hiwarale in JsPointLearn more.Medium is an open platform where 170 million readers come to find insightful and dynamic thinking."
"<strong class=""bt"">Creating RESTful APIs with Spring Boot 2 and MongoDB</strong>",https://medium.com/@ahmodadeola/creating-restful-apis-with-spring-boot-2-and-mongodb-3bba937cd438?source=tag_archive---------11-----------------------,"Java,Rest Api,Web Development,Mongodb,Spring Boot","Photo by Rodion Kutsaev on UnsplashIn modern day software development, It is a prevalent practice for non-static apps or websites to access content resources over the internet which could be sourced from a third-party company or developed in-house for personal use. One of the most common ways to build such a content service is via the RESTful API, REST stands for Representational state transfer, API means Application Programming Interface, RESTful is just the adjective form of REST.RESTful API is a software architectural style of exposing resources on a computer for accessing and manipulation through some set of stated operations with restrictions, basically it’s a way you can expose some data resources on your computer upon request through some endpoint defined by you.In this write up, we will be building a RESTful API to access and manipulate students data over the network using Spring boot 2, a Java framework and MongoDB, a database system.Let’s get startedWhat is Spring boot?Last year, Netflix announced they would be migrating all of their back end services to Spring boot.Spring boot is a layer built atop Spring, a popular, powerful and robust Java framework used to build Java Enterprise applications. Spring obliviates the quite stressful tasks which could be associated with building large Java applications by letting developers focus more on the business logic of the project they’re working on rather than the core technicalities of the language environment; but it requires some configuration XML files to properly enforce it’s core functionalities such as IoC(inversion of Control), dependency injection and so on. Meanwhile, spring boot removes the process of writing those mandatory configuration XML files, it uses annotations to wire our app components together to speed up development process.Why are we using spring boot?It is lightweight and easy to understand and use.It shortens development time as it handles a lot of things for us behind the scene.It lets us build highly secure apps.What is MongoDB?MongoDB is an open source, NoSQL database system used for storing data, unlike a relational database, MongoDB stores data as documents in a rich JSON (JavaScript object notation) format which is enveloped as an object in a collection. For this app, we will have a students collection which stores a student document.Why MongoDB?It has a cloud service we can utilize to store and retrieve our data rather than install and set-up locally on our PC.It’s very easy to use and work with for developers.we can store high volume of data.How exactly will we achieve our aim with them?What we will do is create a server application that lets our computer listen for incoming request from clients over the network and serves resources based upon the parameters of the request made. Spring boot handles our server creation with Apache Tomcat, so we can solely focus on the API logic. In this article, our computer will be connected to a MongoDB database, upon some http request method and perhaps payload, our student database is accessed for some data and modified, then a response is sent to the client (which could be a browser or script sending a request to our server).What tools do we need for development?Java SDK which supports nothing less than Java 8 i.e Java v1.8, Spring boot 2.X would only support Java version above 7.An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that supports Java, I will be using IntelliJ IDEA.POSTMAN, Google chrome API testing extension, rest client or any API test tool of your choice.Let’s have our database in placeFor storing students data, we will use the MongoDB cloud version, MongoDB Atlas to skip the process of setting up MongoDB on our computer. You can choose to skip this section if you have MongoDB already setup on your machine or have an existing MongoDB atlas account.So let’s create an account and have our DB up and running at https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register.Fill in your details as shown above and click on the “Get started free” button.The next page displays info about the cluster plans MongoDB Atlas offers, since we want to build a trivial app, choose the free shared cluster option and proceed.Afterward, you will have to configure your cluster with respect to your location, but I will just move on with the default options.After creating your cluster, you should see a cluster dashboard where you can setup connection to start using the database, click on the connect tab as shown belowThen an overlay displays with some connection configuration options, select the “Allow Access From Anywhere” option, then enter a username and password to create a MongoDB user for your database, then click on “Choose Connection Method”.Moving on, select the option to use MongoDB from your application, then proceed to the “Connect” tab where you will be asked to select your driver and version, you can choose to leave the values as it is, we are more interested in the connection string, so copy and save it somewhere, we will make use of it to setup our spring boot database connection soon.Once you’re done saving the connection string somewhere, we can move on with working with on the main app with Spring Boot.Getting Our RESTful API In ShapeTo get started with Spring Boot, We need to use the Spring initializr to bootstrap our app dependencies and others, so navigate to https://start.spring.io.The page contains multiple config options to select from,then a zip file containing a starting template with respect to the options chosen will be generated when we’re done.⦁ We will use maven as our project’s build tool and Spring Boot v2.3.3⦁ fill the project metadata with whatever values you feel like using but maintain consistency just as I have done above.⦁ Select JAR for packaging⦁ I will use Java 8, so as to stick with the minimum Java functionalities Spring Boot requires.⦁ For dependencies, search and select Spring WEB and Spring Data MongoDB⦁ Click on Generate, you should have the studentsData zip file downloaded on your machine.Proceed to opening the project folder with IntelliJ IDEA, your project should have its dependencies resolving which means our app’s required resources are being made available by maven, You can see the message at the mid bottom of IntelliJ. Open the studentsData\pom.xml and you should find all of the projects dependencies.If intelliJ underlines some part of the xml file in red, it means the project’s dependencies weren’t resolved successfully, so right click on the “studentsData” folder under project at the left corner, find and click on maven, then click on “Generate Sources and Update Folders”, your project errors should be fixed some while after doing that.Let’s setup our app to use MongoDBIf you have MongoDB installed on your machine and won’t be using MongoDB atlas, feel free to skip this part because Spring boot will automatically try to connect to MongoDB server at mongodb://localhost/test, just make sure you launch mongod on your terminal to start a MongoDB server on your machine.Now, open src\main\resources\application.properties and set spring.data.mongodb.uri to the connection string you had saved earlier from MongoDB atlas, replace “<password>” in the connection string with your password, and set “<dbname>” to “studentsData”Structuring Our ProjectSpring Boot has several conventions for structuring projects, we will make use of the DAO pattern. We will structure our code into 4 packages inside the com.studentsData.students package and our entry java class, studentsDataApplication.java will remain directly within the com.studentsData.students package.Understanding Our Project Structure⦁ studentsDataApplication.java is our app’s entry class, it gets launched immediately we run our app.⦁ The service package contains java class(es) related to the business logic of our application and calls the DAO to perform it’s function.⦁ model defines the structure of data to be stored in our database.⦁ DAO(Direct Access Object) defines and performs raw database operations⦁ Repository contains an interface which helps with creation of custom database queries in addition to the already available ones.⦁ api package contains REST Controller class that handles http requests made by clients and sends response.Go ahead to create the Student.java class in the model package,and type in the following lines of codepublic class Student {    private final String name;    private final String department;    @Id    private String id;    public Student(@JsonProperty(""name"") String name, @JsonProperty(""department"") String department) {        this.name = name;        this.department = department;    }    public String getName() {        return name;    }    public String getDepartment() {        return department;    }    public String getId() {        return id;    }}The class defines the Student model, it contains the name, department and id fields to store the corresponding info about the student, notice the “@id” annotation before the id field, this informs spring boot to map the MongoDB auto-generated id to this field, @JSONProperty(“name”) and @JSONProperty(“department”) maps “name” and “department” keys of the JSON included as body of a post request to the name and department parameters of our Student constructor. We then defined getter methods to be used by Spring Boot to populate the Student object.Now, move on to create the studentRepository interface inside the repository package, then type in the following codepublic interface StudentRepository extends MongoRepository<Student, String> {    public Student findByName(String name);}This interface extends the MongoRepository class provided by Spring Data MongoDB, it let’s us create custom queries on our database in addition to the ones already provided by MongoDB such as findAll(), insert(), e.t.c. In this class, we declared a custom query method to find student by name, MongoDB will create the implementation of the class at runtime.Moving forward, create StudentDAO.java interface inside the DAO package with the following codepublic interface StudentDAO{    public List<Student> getAllStudents();    public Student getStudentById(String id);    public  Student getStudentByName(String name);    public Student addStudent(Student student);    public Student updateStudent(Student student);    public void deleteStudent(Student student);}The DAO will be used to make transactions with MongoDB, so we created an interface that contained all methods that we will make use of to access and manipulate our database, you can add more if you want. Before we can make use of it, it’s implementation is crucial, still inside the DAO package, create StudentDAOImpl.java then type in the following code@Repositorypublic class StudentDAOImpl implements StudentDAO{    @Autowired    private final StudentRepository studentRepository;    public StudentDAOImpl(StudentRepository studentRepository){        this.studentRepository = studentRepository;    }    @Override    public List<Student> getAllStudents() {        return studentRepository.findAll();    }    @Override    public Student addStudent(Student student) {        return studentRepository.insert(student);    }    @Override    public Student getStudentById(String id) {        Optional<Student> student = studentRepository.findById(id);        return student.get();    }    @Override    public Student getStudentByName(String name) {        return studentRepository.findByName(name);    }    @Override    public Student updateStudent(Student newStudent) {        return studentRepository.save(newStudent);    }    @Override    public void deleteStudent(Student student) {        studentRepository.delete(student);    }}The @Repository annotation informs Spring Boot that this class is a repository and the necessary attachments should be made. @Autowired helped us create object instance of StudentRepository (i.e the studentRepository data field) without making an explicit instance creation, this is handled by Spring Boot using dependency injection. So we’ve implemented all the methods declared in the StudentDAO interface by invoking methods of studentRepository.Going further, we can now create the StudentService class which will mediate between StudentController and StudentDAO, create StudentService class inside the service package, then enter the following lines@Servicepublic class StudentService {    private final StudentDAOImpl studentDAO;    @Autowired    public StudentService(StudentDAOImpl studentDAO) {        this.studentDAO = studentDAO;    }    public List<Student> getAllStudents(){        return studentDAO.getAllStudents();    }    public Student getStudent(String id){        return studentDAO.getStudentById(id);    }    public Student getStudentByName(String name){        return studentDAO.getStudentByName(name);    }    public Student addStudent(Student student){        return studentDAO.addStudent(student);    }    public Student updateStudent(Student student){        return studentDAO.updateStudent(student);    }    public void removeStudent(String id){        Student student = studentDAO.getStudentById(id);        studentDAO.deleteStudent(student);    }}This class uses the studentDAOImpl class methods to carry out operations on our database, dependency injection is also carried out here as indicated by @Autowired, we then created methods to create, get student(s) and update student data by calling the required studentDAOImpl methods. All that is left to do is to make use of this service in our REST controller class.Create the StudentController.java class inside the api package, then input the following lines of code@RequestMapping(""api/v1/student"")@RestControllerpublic class StudentController {    @Autowired    private final StudentService studentService;    public StudentController(StudentService studentService) {        this.studentService = studentService;    }    @GetMapping    public List<Student> getAll(){     return studentService.getAllStudents();    }    @GetMapping(value = ""{id}"")    public Student getById(@PathVariable(""id"") String id){        return studentService.getStudent(id);    }    @PostMapping    public Student addStudent(@RequestBody Student student){        return studentService.addStudent(student);    }    @DeleteMapping(value = ""{id}"")    public void removeStudent(@PathVariable String id){        studentService.removeStudent(id);    }}@RestController and @RequestMapping(“api/v1/student”) annotate that this class is used to handle http requests, serves JSON, XML and custom response, and declares the request URI used to access our service which is “api/v1/student”, our app will only handle requests made to localhost:8080/api/v1/student.As usual, the studentService field is auto-wired to create it’s instance implicitly, @GetMapping indicates the method will be used to handle a GET http request, getAll() returns all the students data in our database when a GET request is sent to localhost:8080/api/v1/student, @GetMapping(value=”{id}”) will handle request with dynamic URI that includes an id, the request URI will be localhost/api/v1/{id} where id is the id of the student we want to fetch from the database and the @PathVariable injects the id in the URI as argument for the method.@PostMapping handles POST request, @RequestBody tells that the request requires a body whose values are used to create the student object which will be the argument for the addStudent method. @DeleteMapping handles the request to delete student specified by id in our database.All of our project classes have been created and populated, let’s run our code by launching the app from studentsDataApplication.java.If everything is properly set in your project files, you should have some messages logged in your console that looks like thisSo Spring Boot has started a Tomcat server to listen for http requests, let’s proceed with testing our RESTful API.Testing our REST APII will use Postman for making http requests, you can use any API testing tool you feel comfortable using.Launch Postman, open the build view, if you have another view opened, you can switch to build view by clicking on build at the bottom right of the app window.Enter the REST API URI, localhost:8080/api/v1/student, using the GET method option, hit sendNotice the “200 ok” text on the right, this is an http status code which indicates that our http request was a success. The response is the empty square brackets which should contain students info saved in our database but is empty since we haven’t added any student to our database, let’s populate our database next.Now, change the request method from “GET” to “POST”, and change the option in the Params dropdown directly below the “POST” dropdown from Params to Body, then create a JSON with the student’s name and department then hit send.At the response section on the right side of the window, you can see we got a 200 status code and also, we got a JSON response containing our student’s info with an id attached, go on to add more students, then make a GET request to localhost:8080/api/v1/student to fetch all students info.Now let’s fetch a student’s info with id, to do that, we will extend our request’s URI with the specific id and change the request method to GET, so let’s get Omooba Oreoluwa’s details using id.Next, let’s delete a student’s info. I will add a new student with the name “Howard Robert” at Biochemistry, then I will use the delete http request with the generated id to delete the student from the databaseThe student data has been added to the database, now, let’s delete the student from the database,Let’s check the list of students info in our collection, you can see Howard Robert isn’t present in our collection anymore.At this point, we’ve verified the functionality of the RESTful API we’ve created and can make request based on the operations we’ve defined. You can go further to add more operations to manipulate our database inside the REST Controller class.You can find the project’s code at https://github.com/Ahmodadeola/studentsDataApi_with_SpringBoot2.git.Congrats, you can now build RESTful APIs with Spring Boot, go explore more about Spring Boot and build greater apps.Written bySalaudeen AhmadA passion driven software developer, computer science student, tech enthusiast and a muslim.Follow13 13 13 JavaRest ApiWeb DevelopmentMongodbSpring BootMore from Salaudeen AhmadFollowA passion driven software developer, computer science student, tech enthusiast and a muslim.More From MediumCreational Design Pattern: BuilderPetey in The StartupBuilding your own MTurk-style app in R using Shiny+FlexdashboardEric Green in NiviBad API design — studying confusing AppsFlyer Server-to-server APIAlexey Strelkov in The StartupThe 439 day Journey that Changed my LifeDaniel Lemay in freeCodeCamp.orgThe Kubernetes Cluster Architecture SimplifiedLuisapreciado in Dev GeniusJava: Build Automation With MavenUday Chauhan in The StartupStrict Types in PHPJose Maria Valera Reales in The StartupBuilding Your Own WotsApp — Part 5Mark Lucking in Better ProgrammingAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Dark Mode and CSS Variables,https://medium.com/better-programming/dark-mode-and-css-variables-ed6dc250232c?source=tag_archive---------12-----------------------,"Dark Mode,Web Development,CSS,JavaScript,Programming","Photo by Mike Petrucci on UnsplashDark mode is something that many of us enjoy but not many have had the chance to implement so far. As I’ve seen my fair share of stubborn setups, I want to share with you some key points you should consider before starting or take into consideration if you’re already using it.I’ll be using the implementation of dark mode/light mode from our Learn By Ear app as an example, which you can check the live version of here.The Deep DiveLet’s dive into it.Our web app just has to have a dark mode, as we want to give the users the possibility to choose whatever fits them most during the time they interact with our product along with other preferences.Of course, implementing or having in mind that you’ll need to have two themes from the get-go is helpful, but that’s not always the case. The principles I’ll be sharing with you can be used for both — new implementations as well as refactoring. At the end of the day, it’s all about the key points.Small remark: We chose Neumorphism as our design pattern, meaning our three colours for the light mode and three for the dark mode were already established. I say established because of the way the effect of Neumorphism works, but I won’t focus on that part here, as it’s specific to Neumorphism. If you’re interested, though, you can read about it in detail.So as I was saying, Neumorphism established these two sets of colours (the screenshots below are from the project in Figma, which we’re using as a software of choice for our design mocks):Light mode base setDark mode base setAnd while we already had three colours per mode, we knew we had to at least have two more — for text and a helper colour (to start with). The way we set up those colours was similar to how we chose the three main ones, which resulted in the following:Light modeDark modeWe first put the three core colours and then followed with the helper colour — Grey — and the one for the fonts — Dark.I’d like to stop here for a moment: The way Grey and Dark are named is problematic. First of all, we can see that Grey isn’t really grey in the dark mode scenario, and Dark probably would need to be much lighter if we want to use it on dark backgrounds.This is the biggest mistake I see theme implementers making over and over again — naming the colours for their colours.What if you add 10 more of them — which include more dark ones, grey ones, and so on? It’ll most likely lead to eventually having a hot mess, not easily (or at all) useable, and forget about creating adjustable or extendable code. What if you want to have a greyscale mode? Or red? See how that can get out of hand pretty fast?You need to name the colours by the functions they represent.Let me show you what I mean:Light modeDark modeAbove, we broke down our colours into three main sections:TextElementsHelpersWe were able to break it down this way by outlining our app’s design sketches and seeing which elements of the page will need to have colours and how they differ from each other.ElementsMain, Shadow, and Highlight are from Neumorphism’s pattern but renamed; if you check, initially they were Light, Primary, and Secondary, which can be confusing once you start working with it, as Neumorphism uses those colours for shadow and highlight effects.TextMain will vary depending on its background (lighter on darker and vice versa). Dimmed as text could also represent a disabled state and may be smaller/secondary.HelpersDanger and Success are for visual feedback, letting the user know if they’re right/wrong when they’re learning the app. The colours don’t necessarily need to be red or green (they can be pink and blue or purple and yellow).We named them as per our main front-end library’s (Bootstrap) naming convention. Then, since our design is pretty minimalistic, we wanted to include one popping colour, which can again vary based on the main element’s vibe, so we named it PopColour.The ImplementationImplementing this system of naming is so, so, so much more extendable than for example having Black, Blue, and White as names. If you’re still not convinced, keep reading and I’ll show you how it is when you start actually working with it.Once we got our naming sorted (this doesn’t have to be the final result, but you’ve got the hang of it), let’s set up some native CSS variables (you can read about them in the official docs here):We set them on a root level, as per the documentation. These are our default values. Now, whenever you want to use them, you can simply do it this way:But wait, those were only the colours from the light mode, right? That’s right. In a similar way, we declare the dark mode variables:Wait, what is this [data-theme='dark']?This is the key for your theme change! It’ll apply the values of those variables when your html tag has that attribute <html [data-theme='dark']> (you can also do this through JavaScript — let me know if you want me to share the code of that too).And the body?The body stays exactly the same! And because we named the variables in a meaningful way, without unnecessary attachment to their colour value, you get so much freedom!The Hard WayLet me show you how it looks like when you do it the very hard way.We have a toggle switch on our website for the light/dark mode change, and sometimes it looks like this:Light and dark mode toggle switchesIf we were to keep the Black, Blue, and White naming convention, we’d have this as our CSS:But that’d work only for our light mode, right? So then you’d need to extend it with:And you’d need to repeat that on every single element that changes! That loses the sense of variables a bit there, and, in general, is just pure madness.You want your variables to work for your theme, not to just store some information like a safe box.Let’s go further and say you want to implement a special theme for New Years or for spring — or both!You need to cover every element and change every colour for every theme. Woah, that’s a lot of every, isn’t it?I’m pretty sure not many people would like to take on that task, and the amount of errors that can come out of it is just way too big.Instead, if we implement variables the way I suggested, we’d have only this line of code:All the assignments of colours to their respective variables will happen in another place (where your other variables are), and once you change the attribute, it’ll do the work for you.This way you keep all your colours in one place, and you need to add/change them in only one place. A much cleaner state and safer implementation:Isn’t that much cleaner and more organised?For those of you who do have an existing setup already, I’d suggest trying to break it into variables with the suggested naming convention first and then applying them throughout the code. Once you’re done with that — you can start adding themes.ConclusionIn conclusion, don’t create useless work for yourself or your colleagues. This doesn’t mean that every project has to start with variables now— use your own judgment for that.But if you do start working with themes, then I’d highly recommend sticking to that naming convention rather than just naming colours for their names.

How to Create a LitElement Web Component — Heart/Unheart,https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-create-a-litelement-web-component-heart-unheart-32a7ca8c45c1?source=tag_archive---------13-----------------------,"Litelement,Web Components,UI,Front End Development,Web Development","Icons made by Freepik from www.flaticon.comWith React and Vue being the dominant players in the frontend field, most developers are reluctant to try out other frameworks (or libraries, the line is quite blurry with the current state of the web). I have always been a fan of framework-less approaches whenever possible and reasonable, so when Web Components debuted on Chrome, I was excited to play around with them without any frameworks to see what it was about. Needless to say, it was all very vanilla and hard to scale for production apps. I then sadly decided to end my affair with Web Components and stick to React or Vue.By some chance, I got a job working with Polymer Web Components. To give some context, I am a frontend developer in love with building UI components in particular. It is such a niche in Hong Kong that there are probably only less than 20 companies in the whole market with a need for UI component specialists. After a lengthy search, my passion finally led me to my current job where I get to use Polymer and focus on UI components most of the time.Working with Polymer brought me faith in Web Components once again. I am impressed by how elegant it is to use a more native approach to build web applications. Polymer has been around for several years by now, and their team has shifted focus to LitElement, so I thought it was time to start getting into LitElement.I am sure most developers do the same when they try out new tools. We google. We stackoverflow. I did too.It is only after some googling do I realise that I live on the bleeding edge:A search of (“lit-element” OR “LitElement”) AND “component” showed about 30,400 results to date, whereas about 201,000,000 results showed up for (“React” OR “ReactJS”) AND “component”.Web components are immensely underrated. I can see why it is not used in production for many reasons, one of them being not many developers are familiar with it, and another would be it being too bleeding edge and therefore unreliable as a long-term investment until it gains more popularity. However, it won’t do developers harm to learn how to build UI components with LitElement, and that is precisely why I am writing this article to introduce the beauty of it.Today, we are going to create a heart toggle button. It is pretty standard for most web applications. Similar components are the star button, the hamburger menu button, and any kind of icon-based toggle buttons.Getting StartedTo begin, I highly recommend the JavaScript starter project and the TypeScript starter project on GitHub. In this article, we will use JavaScript instead of TypeScript to make things simpler. The prerequisites here are basic knowledge of JavaScript, Webpack/Rollup, and npm/yarn.After you cloned the project starter to your computer via git, or download the zipped folder and unzipped it, you should run the following command to install the dependencies stated in package.json:npm installORyarn installOnce it is done, go ahead and run the server!npm run serveORyarn run serveWhen the command has finished running, you should see this on your terminal.es-dev-server started on http://localhost:8000Using the starter project template available at the time of writing, http://localhost:8000 shows “Not Found”. Does that mean our app has failed to run? No, because if it is not running, you will see something like this:Nothing is running here :(Let’s have a look at the project folder structure and see where we should go.The folder structureHere we see an HTML file under the dev folder. It means that we can go to http://localhost:8000/dev/ and see this file.Right now, there is the template starter content using <my-element></my-element>. We are going to duplicate my-element.js at the root folder to create our heart toggle button element. We will go back to the index.html under /dev/ once we have finished our component.The first step is to rename the file to heart-toggle.js, all instances of MyElement to HeartToggle, and my-element to heart-toggle. If you are wondering why we name the element heart-toggle instead of heart, it is because a valid custom element name must contain at least one hyphen.Setting up the ElementThen, let’s do these:Remove all the commentsRemove all CSS inside :host {}Replace the HTML part in render() with <span></span>Now your heart-toggle.js should contain the following code:import {LitElement, html, css} from 'lit-element';export class HeartToggle extends LitElement {  static get styles() {    return css`      :host {      }    `;  }static get properties() {    return {      name: {type: String},      count: {type: Number},    };  }constructor() {    super();    this.name = 'World';    this.count = 0;  }render() {    return html`<span></span>`;  }_onClick() {    this.count++;  }}window.customElements.define('heart-toggle', HeartToggle);To make development easier, let’s go to /dev/index.html on your IDE, add <script type=""module"" src=""../heart-toggle.js""></script> within the head tag and add <heart-toggle></heart-toggle> below </my-element> so that we can see the changes made in the heart-toggle component instantly with hot reload.Your /dev/index.html will look like this:<!doctype html><html>  <head>    <meta charset=""utf-8"">    <title>&lt;my-element> Demo</title>    <script type=""module"" src=""../my-element.js""></script>    <script type=""module"" src=""../heart-toggle.js""></script>    <style>      p {        border: solid 1px blue;        padding: 8px;      }    </style>  </head>  <body>    <my-element>      <p>This is child content</p>    </my-element>    <heart-toggle></heart-toggle>  </body></html>For those of you with experience in React and Vue, the code in heart-toggle.js should look fairly familiar. For those of you without any previous frontend framework experience, this should be much less overwhelming than it was initially. With this cleaner template, we will dive deeper into each part.Styling the ElementWeb components make use of custom elements and shadow DOM, the :host selector in CSS is targeting the shadow host of the custom element. Code in the shadow DOM is scoped within the element and will not be affected by global styles or document methods like getElementById() and querySelector() without a specific selection of the shadow root of the custom element. Read more about shadow DOM if you are interested.Let’s add some CSS to our bland component.:host {  --icon-size: 16vw;  display: block;  width: var(--icon-size);  height: var(--icon-size);  cursor: pointer;}span {  display: block;  width: 100%;  height: 100%;  background-image: url(https://image.flaticon.com/icons/svg/929/929559.svg);  background-size: 100% auto;}:host span::after {  content: """";  display: block;  width: 100%;  height: 100%;  top: 0;  left: 0;  background-image: url(https://image.flaticon.com/icons/svg/929/929417.svg);  opacity: 0;  transition: opacity 0.4s;}:host([loved]) span::after {  opacity: 1;}In the :host, we are using a CSS variable to set the size of the icon. Using a CSS variable makes customization easier because you can target heart-toggle and set the variable size in global styles..homepage heart-toggle {  --icon-size: 4px;}.profile heart-toggle {  --icon-size: 2rem;)We mentioned earlier that the shadow DOM elements are scoped and cannot be targeted from the outside. It is true for both CSS targeting and JavaScript targeting. You can target the custom element itself, but nothing in the shadow DOM (in our case the <span></span>) with global CSS selectors, but you can still make all your customizations within the LitElement component and use properties to set what state and hence what styles the component should be showing.I am using the pseudo-element ::after instead of another span or the same span for the filled heart icon because of the fading visual effect. You can tweak the DOM and styles for your usage.As you can see from the above CSS, there is an attribute selector [loved] on heart-toggle. We need to add it as a property of the element and allow it to show as an attribute.Adding a Propertystatic get properties() {  return {   loved: {     type: Boolean,     reflect: true,   } }}The option reflect: true will set the attribute loved to each instance of the element heart-toggle when the property is true, and remove it when it is false for the instance of the component.The final work for our component is to make the loved property toggle upon the user’s click.constructor() {  super();  this.addEventListener(""click"", this._onClick);}_onClick() {  this.loved = !this.loved;}You can add all sorts of event listeners in the constructor, and handle the events with your event handlers in the way you would normally do with JavaScript.Great job! You have created your first LitElement web component! 👏👏👏If you haven’t had the time to set up the starter project on your computer, you can tweak my demo on CodePen to try it out.Heart Toggle LitElement Demo on CodePenThe official guide of LitElement is a great resource for learning more about building web components.

Material UI — Icons and Lists,https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/material-ui-icons-and-lists-a98c8ccbdac0?source=tag_archive---------14-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Chimene Gaspar on UnsplashMaterial UI is a Material Design library made for React.It’s a set of React components that have Material Design styles.In this article, we’ll look at how to add icons and lists with Material UI.Icon ColorWe can change the color of icons.To do that, we add the color prop to the icon.For example, we can write:import React from ""react"";import red from ""@material-ui/core/colors/red"";import MailIcon from ""@material-ui/icons/Mail"";export default function App() {  return (    <div>      <MailIcon />      <MailIcon color=""primary"" />      <MailIcon color=""secondary"" />      <MailIcon color=""action"" />      <MailIcon color=""disabled"" />      <MailIcon style={{ color: red[500] }} />    </div>  );}to add icons with different colors.The color prop lets us change the color style of the icon.We can also change it with the style prop.We set the color by import the color from Material UI.SizeTo change the size of an icon, we can change the fontSize prop.For example, we can write:import React from ""react"";import MailIcon from ""@material-ui/icons/Mail"";export default function App() {  return (    <div>      <MailIcon fontSize=""small"" />      <MailIcon />      <MailIcon fontSize=""large"" />      <MailIcon style={{ fontSize: 50 }} />    </div>  );}The fontSize can be set to small or large .To set a custom size, we can also set the style prop with the fontSize of our choice.Font iconsTo add our own icons from the Material Icons CDN, we can add a link tag to index.html :<link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons"" />Once we did that, we can use the Icon component:import React from ""react"";import Icon from ""@material-ui/core/Icon"";export default function App() {  return (    <div>      <Icon>star</Icon>    </div>  );}We can also change the color with this component.For example, we can write:import React from ""react"";import green from ""@material-ui/core/colors/green"";import Icon from ""@material-ui/core/Icon"";export default function App() {  return (    <div>      <Icon>star</Icon>      <Icon color=""primary"">star</Icon>      <Icon color=""secondary"">star</Icon>      <Icon style={{ color: green[500] }}>star</Icon>      <Icon fontSize=""small"">star</Icon>    </div>  );}We have the name of the icon in between the tags.And we set the color prop to change the color.Font AwesomeIn addition to Material Icons, we can add Font Awesome icons.We can use version 5 without signing up.We just have to add:<link  rel=""stylesheet""  href=""https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.13.1/css/all.css""/><link  rel=""stylesheet""  href=""https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.13.1/css/v4-shims.css""/>Then we can write:import React from ""react"";import green from ""@material-ui/core/colors/green"";import Icon from ""@material-ui/core/Icon"";export default function App() {  return (    <div>      <Icon className=""fa fa-close"" />      <Icon className=""fa fa-close"" color=""primary"" />      <Icon className=""fa fa-close"" color=""secondary"" />      <Icon className=""fa fa-close"" style={{ color: green[500] }} />      <Icon className=""fa fa-close"" fontSize=""small"" />    </div>  );}to add our Font Awesome icons.The props work with Font Awesome icons.ListsLists are continuous containers of text and images.For example, we can write:import React from ""react"";import List from ""@material-ui/core/List"";import ListItem from ""@material-ui/core/ListItem"";import ListItemIcon from ""@material-ui/core/ListItemIcon"";import ListItemText from ""@material-ui/core/ListItemText"";import Divider from ""@material-ui/core/Divider"";import InboxIcon from ""@material-ui/icons/Inbox"";import DraftsIcon from ""@material-ui/icons/Drafts"";export default function App() {  return (    <div>      <List component=""nav"">        <ListItem button>          <ListItemIcon>            <InboxIcon />          </ListItemIcon>          <ListItemText primary=""home"" />        </ListItem>        <ListItem button>          <ListItemIcon>            <DraftsIcon />          </ListItemIcon>          <ListItemText primary=""mail"" />        </ListItem>      </List>      <Divider />      <List component=""nav"">        <ListItem button>          <ListItemText primary=""logout"" />        </ListItem>      </List>    </div>  );}to add a list with the List component.To add items inside the list, we can add one or moreListItem components inside it.The button prop will make them render as buttons.List items can have icons beside it.Also, we can add Dividers to add dividers.Nested ListLists can be nested.To do that, we add a Collapse component within our List .For instance, we can write:import React from ""react"";import List from ""@material-ui/core/List"";import ListItem from ""@material-ui/core/ListItem"";import ListItemIcon from ""@material-ui/core/ListItemIcon"";import ListItemText from ""@material-ui/core/ListItemText"";import Collapse from ""@material-ui/core/Collapse"";import InboxIcon from ""@material-ui/icons/MoveToInbox"";import DraftsIcon from ""@material-ui/icons/Drafts"";export default function App() {  const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(true);  const handleClick = () => {    setOpen(!open);  };  return (    <div>      <List component=""nav"">        <ListItem button>          <ListItemIcon>            <InboxIcon />          </ListItemIcon>          <ListItemText primary=""home"" />        </ListItem>        <ListItem button onClick={handleClick}>          <ListItemIcon>            <DraftsIcon />          </ListItemIcon>          <ListItemText primary=""mail"" />        </ListItem>        <Collapse in={open} timeout=""auto"" unmountOnExit>          <List component=""div"" disablePadding>            <ListItem button>              <ListItemText primary=""important mail"" />            </ListItem>          </List>        </Collapse>      </List>    </div>  );}to add a Collapse component into our List .The in prop controls when the nested list is expanded.unmountOnExit will remove the nested list from the DOM.We control whether it’s opened or not with the 2nd ListItem .The handleClick component toggles the open state.Photo by Nick Fewings on UnsplashConclusionWe can add icons from various sources with Material UI.Also, we can add lists to display items vertically.JavaScript In Plain EnglishNew JavaScript + Web Development articles every day.Follow101 ProgrammingWeb

N/A,https://levelup.gitconnected.com/speed-up-your-typescript-vscode-workflow-in-1-minute-2e3c505e008b?source=tag_archive---------15-----------------------,"Typescript,Web Development,Vscode,Software Development,React","Sharing a simple tip that saved me hours of my life over the last 3 years working with TypeScript codebases (especially large ones!).I wish I knew it earlier when I was just getting started with TypeScript…🤔 The problemWe all know how TypeScript can get slow in VS Code. Especially with some codebases with complex type definitions (think polymorphic as props in UI component frameworks!).Ever found yourself waiting for the compiler to catch up with you as you type new code or fix errors?This quickly gets frustrating, slowing down your feedback loops (and fast feedback loops are great to keep you happy and motivated!).Make TypeScript work fasterHere’s the trick:Run a separate TypeScript process in watch mode in a terminal tab. Keep it running as you write code — it’ll respond to changes and highlight errors a lot faster compared to VSCode.In my experience, the difference can be striking (see the screenshot). It seems to depend on the project and npm libs it’s using, but the general pattern is pretty consistent across different projects and TS versions I worked with.Here’s how to set it up for your TypeScript project, step-by-step:Add these 2 NPM scripts to your package.json:""scripts"": {  ...  ""typecheck"": ""tsc"",  ""typecheck:watch"": ""tsc -w""  ...}2. Now run npm run typecheck:watchin a terminal tab (I like to do it in VSCode’s Terminal panel).This starts a separate TypeScript process in the watch mode.It’ll take some time to start, but it’ll be much faster to re-compile your code incrementally as you change your code.3. Use npm run typechek if only need to do the check once. It’ll run faster than the watch mode.I find it handy e.g. before deploying to make sure the build will be succesful.🙌 That’s it!I hope this tip will help you to become a more efficient and happier developer (it certainly helped me).Please share your own experiences — did it help you to speed up your workflow?Level Up CodingCoding tutorials and news.Follow152 1 TypescriptWeb DevelopmentVscodeSoftware DevelopmentReact152 claps152 claps1 responseWritten byDmitry BorodyFollowFull-stack web deverloper. 🚀 Solving problems and building products with ⚛️ React, TypeScript, Node.js, Rust.FollowLevel Up CodingFollowCoding tutorials and news.

Reasons why you should choose Flask over Django,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/why-flask-could-be-a-better-choice-than-django-c3f018edb963?source=tag_archive---------17-----------------------,"Flask Framework,Django Framework,Towards Data Science,Web Development,Programming","Flask vs Django (Image by author)As we all know or might have heard from others (only if you are into web development) that there are two very popular web frameworks. One is, of course, the most famous Django web framework, and the other which is I would say comes just below Django in the fame chart of web frameworks i.e. Flask. There are of course others in the market but for now, I’ll just talk about these two. I shall discuss some of the points that you should remember or consider while choosing either Django or Flask.What exactly is a framework?Those of you, who are into programming, you build programs that require a compiler or an interpreter to convert the source code into byte code, and thus you make command-line applications. The user will then run your script (Python) via a shell and may or may not pass arguments and/or pass the input through stdin (standard input). Now, this is a tedious job for a user because the user has to again install the proper interpreter or compiler to run such programs. Years ago, people felt the need for building standalone applications which do not require the user to install additional programs or compilers, and thus were called Desktop applications. Today with the advent of widespread internet connectivity and a handful of Operating Systems to choose from (both desktop and mobile) it has become a common practice to build web applications rather than OS-based applications. The main advantage of web apps is that users do not need to install apps on their devices to use them. They can directly access the application from their web browser.If you wish to build a web application then you would want to use Python to develop your application and use a so-called web framework. There are lots of tasks in building a web application. The two main tasks are to build the backend and the frontend along with a proper user interface. Then comes attaching everything together and hosting on a web server, so that users can easily navigate to your application in their browser. Here comes the functionality of a web framework. A web framework basically implements all the functionalities of a web application, like mapping URLs to certain blocks of python codes, so that when a user routes to a particular link the corresponding job is done which linked to that application route. We’ll see more of this so-called ‘routing’ later in this article.Difference between Flask and Django implementationFlask implements the minimum required things for a web application to actually work. All the frontend and backend implementation needs to be done by the user. But this is not the disadvantage, rather it’s best if most of the work is left for the developer because every application has its own kind of implementation and every application is different from the other. Again, as a developer, if your application is too large because of unwanted files and codes, then definitely it is not a good implementation. Therefore, Flask lets you create just what you need for your web application.On the other hand, Django gives a lot more than just the bare minimum. It creates a project structure and creates files that are of course needed but with a lot of unwanted code and data. You might be thinking that ready-to-use files will make your life easier. No, you will have to edit those files according to your needs and requirements and a change in the settings will affect your application both the good way and the bad way. Application created with the Django framework will definitely provide you with a lot of more extra features in comparison to Flask, but these features come at a cost. Your project size increases and if you decide to keep those features running in your production too, then you will definitely have a large application size which would in turn cost you extra hosting space.How would you contrast Flask and Django?FlaskFlask is a micro and lightweight web frameworkFlask framework is simple, flexible, and provides you fine-grained controlIt is unopinionated i.e., it lets you as a developer decide what and how you want to implement the various thingsIt can be used to build comparatively simpler web applicationsDjangoDjango is a full-stack web frameworkDjango provides everything in one package during your development processOn project creation, you will get an admin panel, database interfaces, an Object Relational Model (ORM), and most importantly you will get a pre-defined project/directory structureIt can be used to build large and complex web applicationsHow about I talk about the real-life scenario?Both Flask and Django are used to build web-based applications using their respective frameworks. Both are used at a large scale for several high-traffic websites.The following Quora link tells you about some of the websites that use Flask. You will be definitely surprised because I was too! (When I share this content I do not in whatsoever manner claim the ownership of this content.)What is the largest site created using Flask?Answer (1 of 5): #1 (Edit 2015): It seems the largest is probably Pinterest!, see: Steve Cohen's answer to What…www.quora.comBelow is a link clicking which you’ll be redirected to a website where they have shown a list of all the major and famous web apps that use the Django framework: (When I share this content I do not in whatsoever manner claim the ownership of this content.)Some of the best websites developed using Django FrameworkIn addition to emphasising on code readability, Python also enables programmers to express various concepts without…www.allaboutweb.bizSome statistics from the following article:This statistic has been taken from iflexion.com. This contains further information too. (When I share this content I do not in whatsoever manner claim the ownership of this content.)Here is the link: https://www.iflexion.com/blog/python-flask-vs-djangoSource: https://www.iflexion.com/blog/python-flask-vs-django (Image by iflexion)A technical comparison of both Flask and DjangoTemplate EngineFlask is developed based on Jinja2 template engine, which for your information is actually inspired by Django’s template system. It enables developers to write web templates in an expressive language thereby speeding up the application development process. As you have probably guessed, on the other hand, Django has a built-in template engine, which actually lets developers spent less time and effort on the template building part of the process. Django provides something called Django Template Language (DTL) which is used for creating custom templates for your application.Project LayoutIn Flask, developers are required to create separate projects for building separate applications. But the developers are provided with the option of adding multiple models and views to the very same application they are working on. But Django makes developers divide a single project into multiple applications. Then, developers can write individual applications, and add functionality to their main web application by adding the small applications into the project.Database SupportDjango developers generally use the ORM system. In order to implement databases like Oracle, SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, ORMs are a real necessity. The ORM system helps developers avoid writing lengthy SQL queries. This built-in ORM system unlike Django is not provided by Flask. It would require libraries like SQLAlchemy to use database functionalities in Flask. The developers can perform common database actions like, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE by writing and executing normal SQL queries.FlexibilityThe advanced features that come with Django allow the users to build a variety of web applications without using any other third-party tools and libraries. But developers lack the very needed option to make changes to the in-built modules provided by Django which is a major drawback. The modules are, as you can see are non-customizable. Therefore, the developers have to use built-in features provided by the Django web framework to create web applications. On the other hand, Flask, being a micro but extensible web framework, lets developers create web applications in a more flexible fashion by using web development tools and libraries that are open-source and can be added or removed as when required. Trust me, when I started web development, I found Flask much easier and comfortable, and I still use Flask for small projects.Shall we then move onto getting a hands-on experience?Let’s code in Django first! (All commands can be executed in shell or cmd)1. Install Django by running the following command:pip install Django==3.1.12. After a successful installation, we need to create a project. Run the following:django-admin startproject newprojectThis creates a new project named newproject using the django-admin command which was installed during Django installation. After successful creation your directory structure would look something like this:Project directory structure (Image by author)3. Next, we need to use Django to create an app. Please note one project can contain multiple apps. From the outer, newproject directory run the following:python manage.py startapp helloworldThis creates the helloworld app and makes it part of newproject4. Next, we shall configure the URL routing. Open the created helloworld/views.py and add the following:5. Now we shall create a urls.py file for this application. We shall create helloworld/urls.py and add the following:6. The above is the URL configuration for our helloworld application. We will be needing a URL configuration for our project too. We shall edit the automatically created file newproject/newproject/urls.py. This one belongs to the entire project the previous one belongs to the app alone. Add the following in this file:7. Now go back to the outer directory /newproject that contains manage.py and run the following:python manage.py runserverThis will run the Django development server at localhost. As you can see from the terminal output our server is running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ (Note that it is http and not https)Successful server run (Image by author)We can now visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello to view our “Hello, World!”. (The /hello is important because this will be a GET /hello request to the server)Browser output (Image by author)Now let’s take a look at how easier it is to do this whole job in Flask! (All commands can be executed in shell or cmd)1. Install Flask by running the following command:pip install Flask== 1.1.22. After successful installation, create a python file called helloworld.py and insert the following:This does almost all of the work first, it creates an app called app then it configures a URL route “/” which is actually index i.e. when the browser sends an http request at the website IP or the resource name (Example: example.com), there will be a GET / request sent to the server. Therefore, from our app above it will return a message “Hello, World!” in text/html document type. This is also known as the default root of the application. Finally the last line we see that on running the python script, it would trigger main and thus, app.run() will be executed which in turn will start the application.3. Run the following command to start the web application to look at the results:python helloworld.pyThis will run the Flask server at localhost. As you can see from the terminal output our server is running at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Note that it is http and not https)Successful server run (Image by author)We can now visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to view our “Hello, World!”.Browser output (Image by author)As you can it was barely a 3-step job to get a server running on your localhost and display “Hello, World!” in the case of Flask implementation whereas it took around 7 good steps to get a Django server running to do the same job. Please note that by default, Flask runs on port 5000, and Django runs on port 8000.Now comes the real question which one should you choose? Flask or Django? Both have their own perks and limitations. Choose Flask if you are focused on having more control about what components to use and what not (like databases, etc.) And, choose Django, if you are in need or want to develop basic straightforward applications such as blogs, e-stores, etc. where you would want to use all the standard things in the most obvious ways. The entire code and project are uploaded separately on Github at Link.ConclusionIn this article, I tried to provide a basic introduction to the framework, Flask and Django frameworks, followed by a good comparison between the two, and then I tried to explain to you how to create a basic application on both these frameworks.In short, I think Django is a heavy framework if you are trying to learn about frameworks and do a little web programming by developing a small app and at times it could become very difficult for you if you do not have a basic understanding of web frameworks. But yes, on the other hand, the extra work that Django does for you will be very useful and can save a lot of time.Still, confused about which one to use? Use Flask to get a hang of the entire web application development process and you’ll not find stuff that is of no use to you in Flask. Django will make things complicated for you if you’re doing it for the first time.Data Driven Investorempowering you with data, knowledge, and expertiseFollow147 Sign up for DDIntelBy Data Driven InvestorIn each issue we share the best stories from the Data-Driven Investor's expert community. Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

Node.js Best Practices — Exceptions,https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/node-js-best-practices-exceptions-3763f1a70fbf?source=tag_archive---------18-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Vasily Koloda on UnsplashLike any kind of apps, JavaScript apps also have to be written well.Otherwise, we run into all kinds of issues later on.In this article, we’ll look at some best practices we should follow when writing Node apps.Use Promises for Async Error HandlingWe should use promises for async error handling.Handling async errors in the callback style would be a mess if we have many nested callbacks.Node style callbacks don’t allow us to chain the async calls without nesting.To avoid this, we should make sure that we use promises.For example, instead of writing:getData(someParameter, function(err, result){    if(err !== null && err !== undefined)    getMoreData(a, function(err, result){          if(err !== null && err !== undefined)        getMoreData(b, function(c){                 getMoreData(d, function(e){                     //...                });            });        });    });});We have 4 nested callbacks, which is definitely hard to read even if if we omit the logic code.Instead, we write:doWork()  .then(doWork)  .then(doMoreWork)  .then(doWork)  .catch(errorHandler)  .then(verify);We can make this a long cleaner since promises has a then method which we can pass callbacks into.If we want to catch errors, we use the catch method.We can also use the async and await syntax to chang promises and use try-catch to catch errors.For instance, we can write:const work = async () =>  try {    const r1 = await doWork();    const r2 = await doMoreWork();    const r3 = await doWork();    const r4 = await verify();  }  catch (e) {    errorHandler(e)  }}Each then callback returns a promise so we can use await on them.Use Only the Built-in Error ObjectThe built-in error constructor should be used to create errors.The Error constructor has the error message and stack trace.They’re useful for troubleshooting issues which will be lost if we throw anything elseFor example, instead of writing:throw 'error';We write:throw new Error(""error"");It’ll have the stack trace up to where the error is thrown.Distinguish Operational vs Programmer ErrorsWe should distinguish operational vs programmer errors.Operational errors are errors where the impact of the error is fully understood and can be handled.Programmer errors refer to unknown code failures where we need to gracefully restart the application.For the errors we can handle, we should be able to handle them and avoid restating our app.We can throw errors, by writing:if(!product) {  throw new Error(""no product selected"");}const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();myEmitter.emit('error', new Error('error'));We can throw errors in synchronous code and event emitters.We can throw an error in a promise with:new Promise((resolve, reject) => {  DAL.getProduct(productToAdd)    .then((product) =>{       if(!product)         return reject(new Error(""no product added""));       }    })});We have a promise that calls reject with an Error instance to throw the error.These are the right ways to throw errors.Other ways that are around include listening to the uncaughtException event:process.on('uncaughtException', (error) => {  if (!error.isOperational)    process.exit(1);});Listening to the uncaughtException event changes the behavior of the event so it shouldn’t be listened to.process.exit is also a bad way to end a program because it abruptly ends the program.Photo by Kelly Sikkema on UnsplashConclusionWe should throw and catch errors in the right way.This way our app will handle them gracefully.JavaScript In Plain EnglishDid you know that we have three publications and a YouTube channel?

Implementing Web Push Notification in a MERN Stack Application.,https://medium.com/@guptachaitanya31/implementing-web-push-notification-in-a-mern-stack-application-46f70f118299?source=tag_archive---------19-----------------------,"Mern,Web Development,Web Push Notifications","Web Push NotificationsSo this is my first blog on medium.com and today I want to show you guys how to implement web push notification into your MERN stack application in a very simple manner. I also went to a lot of articles and blogs and I didn’t find them to be helpful so I thought why not create my own blog for helping you guys.There is a lot of documentation present out there explaining about service workers and how push notifications are being processed and sent but in this blog, we will dive straight and implement this feature.So after the implementation, you will be having a send function with just title and message as arguments or parameters, and boom the push notification will be sent.So let’s begin…My Folder StructurePushNotification--- push------public-------sw.js------src-------utils--------Push.js--- server.js---package.json etcSetting up React and Node application.In the root folder create a file named server.js and setup the express server by installingnpm i body-parser cors express web-pushGenerating Vapid KeysOpen the terminal and write the following command for getting VAPID keys./node_modules/.bin/web-push generate-vapid-keysAfter running the command you will get two keys, public vapid key, and private vapid key store them somewhere for now.Open server.js and put the following code…const express = require(""express"");const app = express();const port = 3001;const webpush = require(""web-push"");const cors = require(""cors"");const bodyParser = require(""body-parser"");app.use(cors());app.use(bodyParser.json());app.get(""/"", (req, res) => {res.status(200).json({ message: ""Hello express"" });});app.listen(port, () => {console.log(""Server is up and running on port"", port);});Now the endpoint for the push notification …//*****************Push notification Route *******************//const publicVapidKey =""XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"";const privateVapidKey = ""XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"";webpush.setVapidDetails(""mailto:test@test.com"",publicVapidKey,privateVapidKey);app.post(""/subscribe"", (req, res) => {const { subscription, title, message } = req.body;const payload = JSON.stringify({ title, message });webpush.sendNotification(subscription, payload).catch((err) => console.error(""err"", err));res.status(200).json({ success: true });});Boom the endpoint is ready, now we just need to find I place to fire this off.Generate React application using …npx create-react-app pushIn the public folder create a file named sw.js and enter the following code…self.addEventListener('push', e => {const data = e.data.json();console.log('Got push', data);self.registration.showNotification(data.title, {body: data.message,icon: 'favicon.ico'});});This is basically the code that will render the push notification onto the browser.Now in the src folder create a subfolder and inside it a file named utils and Push.js respectively. Then inside Push.js put the following code.Your hard work is complete now you have with you send function which you can use where ever you want.import { send } from './utils/Push'send(""Push Notifications"", ""Push notification successfully sent to the browser! Check it out!"")Push ReceivedThank You guys thought this was helpful, I tried to make it as quick and concise as possible.

Material UI — Customize Tooltips,https://medium.com/dev-genius/material-ui-customize-tooltips-4f82c7857cb2?source=tag_archive---------20-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Kate Remmer on UnsplashMaterial UI is a Material Design library made for React.It’s a set of React components that have Material Design styles.In this article, we’ll look at how to customize tooltips with Material UI.TriggersWe can change how tooltips are triggered.To disable displaying tooltip on hover, we can use the disableHoverListener prop.The disableFocusListener prop lets us disable display tooltip when we focus on an element.disableTouchListener lets us disable tooltip display when we touch an element.For example, we can write:import React from ""react"";import DeleteIcon from ""@material-ui/icons/Delete"";import IconButton from ""@material-ui/core/IconButton"";import Tooltip from ""@material-ui/core/Tooltip"";export default function App() {  return (    <div>      <Tooltip title=""Delete File"" disableFocusListener disableTouchListener>        <IconButton>          <DeleteIcon />        </IconButton>      </Tooltip>    </div>  );}to disable the focus and touch listeners.This way, we’ll see the tooltip if we hover or click on it.We can also control the opening of the tooltip the way we want.We can just make it show on click and disappears when we click away.To do that, we write:import React from ""react"";import DeleteIcon from ""@material-ui/icons/Delete"";import IconButton from ""@material-ui/core/IconButton"";import Tooltip from ""@material-ui/core/Tooltip"";import ClickAwayListener from ""@material-ui/core/ClickAwayListener"";export default function App() {  const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(false);  const handleTooltipClose = () => {    setOpen(false);  };  const handleTooltipOpen = () => {    setOpen(true);  };  return (    <div>      <ClickAwayListener onClickAway={handleTooltipClose}>        <Tooltip          open={open}          title=""Delete File""          disableFocusListener          disableHoverListener          disableTouchListener        >          <IconButton onClick={handleTooltipOpen}>            <DeleteIcon />          </IconButton>        </Tooltip>      </ClickAwayListener>    </div>  );}We added a ClickAwayListener to close the tooltip with the handleTooltipClose function when we click away.And when we click on the IconButton , the handleTooltipOpen will open the tooltip.These are done by changing the open state.We pass it straight into the open prop of the Tooltip .Also, we have disableFocusListener, disableHoverListener , and disableTouchListener to disable all the listeners.Controlled TooltipsTo make a tooltip a controlled tooltip, we can use the open , onClose and onOpen props.For example, we can write:import React from ""react"";import DeleteIcon from ""@material-ui/icons/Delete"";import IconButton from ""@material-ui/core/IconButton"";import Tooltip from ""@material-ui/core/Tooltip"";export default function App() {  const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(false);  const handleTooltipClose = () => {    setOpen(false);  };  const handleTooltipOpen = () => {    setOpen(true);  };  return (    <div>      <Tooltip        open={open}        onClose={handleTooltipClose}        onOpen={handleTooltipOpen}        title=""Delete File""      >        <IconButton>          <DeleteIcon />        </IconButton>      </Tooltip>    </div>  );}to add a Tooltip with the opening and closing of it controlled by the open prop.The prop is set to the open state.Then we have the onClose prop to set the tooltip to close when we do something like hover away to close it.It sets the open state to false .We also have the onOpen prop to open the tooltip by setting the open state to true .Variable WidthWe can change the width of the tooltip by setting the tooltip class with a custom width.For example, we can write:import React from ""react"";import Tooltip from ""@material-ui/core/Tooltip"";import Button from ""@material-ui/core/Button"";import { makeStyles } from ""@material-ui/core/styles"";const useStyles = makeStyles(theme => ({  customWidth: {    maxWidth: 500  }}));const longText = `Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nullam sagittis ullamcorper vehicula. Integer viverra est sed purus vulputate tempus. Vestibulum facilisis, metus et sollicitudin cursus, mi sapien suscipit nunc, vitae tristique diam tortor a urna. Proin auctor, ante ac viverra posuere, urna tortor semper mauris, `;export default function App() {  const classes = useStyles();  return (    <div>      <Tooltip title={longText} classes={{ tooltip: classes.customWidth }}>        <Button className={classes.button}>hover me</Button>      </Tooltip>    </div>  );}We add a longText string which we pass into the title prop.This will be displayed.classes has the classes for the tooltip.We set the tooltip property, to set the tooltip class to the customWidth class returned by makeStyles .InteractiveWe can make a tooltip interactive the interactive prop.This way, it won’t close when the user hovers over the tooltip before the delay to close it expires.For example, we can write:import React from ""react"";import Button from ""@material-ui/core/Button"";import Tooltip from ""@material-ui/core/Tooltip"";export default function App() {  return (    <Tooltip title=""tooltip"" interactive>      <Button>Interactive</Button>    </Tooltip>  );}This way, we’ll see a delay before it closes when we hover away from the button.Photo by Todd Quackenbush on UnsplashConclusionThere are many ways to customize tooltips.We can change how it’s triggered.Also, we can set leave delays, the width, and make it a controlled component.Dev GeniusCoding, Tutorials, News, UX, UI and much more related to developmentFollow124 Sign up for Best StoriesBy Dev GeniusThe best stories sent monthly to your email. Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

Understanding Javascript: Closures,https://blog.usejournal.com/understanding-javascript-closures-3c332b44e936?source=tag_archive---------21-----------------------,"JavaScript,Web Development,Front End Development,Programming,Nodejs","IntroductionUndoubtedly every javascript developer is using closure in his/her day to day life at work and failed to answer the same question once in a lifetime.“Closure is all around you in JavaScript, you just have to recognise and embrace it.” — Kyle SimpsonWhat are Closures?Closure is when a function is able to remember & access its lexical scope even when the function is executed outside its lexical scope. Closure is a behavior of functions & only functions. Closure doesn’t apply on objects, nor classes.A lexical scope in JavaScript means that a variable defined outside a function can be accessible inside another function defined after the variable declaration. But the opposite is not true; the variables defined inside a function will not be accessible outside that function.Let's take an example for better understanding -function eventCounter() {    var count = 0;    return function() {        count++;        console.log(count);    }}var counter = eventCounter();For the basic understanding eventCounter function contains a private variable count and returns a function. Now let’s see what happens when we call the counter function again and again.Want to read this story later? Save it in Journal.counter();// 1When counter function is invoked for the first time we all know that it will print 1 in console.counter();// 2Now the question arises here, when we are invoking the counter function for the second time it will console 2 not 1. Why?The reason behind this is closure, even if we are calling the counter function outside it has access to the lexical scope(basically in the outer scope of the returned function) variable count in eventCounter function through closure scope. So when we called the counter function first time its value is incremented to 1 and now when we are accessing the same variable in the 2nd call which is now incremented from 1 to 2.Benefits of Closures?Able to access the private variable & functions using closures.Maintain state between each function call.In the example, the private variable count can be accessed in the return function scope and its value was maintained in the second callWhy Closures?Imagine you have a button on a page that when clicked, should retrieve and send some data via an Ajax request. Without using a closure:var APIendpoints = {    studentIDs:        ""https://some.api/register-students"",    // ..};var data = {    studentIDs: [ 14, 73, 112, 6 ],    // ..};function makeRequest(evt) {    var btn = evt.target;    var recordKind = btn.dataset.kind;    ajax(        APIendpoints[recordKind],        data[recordKind]    );}// <button data-kind=""studentIDs"">//    Register Students// </button>btn.addEventListener(""click"",makeRequest);The makeRequest(..) utility only receives an evt object from a click event. From there, it has to retrieve the data-kind (accessed as btn.dataset.kind) attribute from the target button element, and use that value to look up both a URL for the API endpoint as well as what data should be included in the Ajax request.This works OK, but it’s unfortunate (inefficient, more confusing) that the event handler has to read a DOM attribute each time it’s fired. Why couldn’t an event handler remember this value? Let’s try using closure to improve the code:var APIendpoints = {    studentIDs:        ""https://some.api/register-students"",    // ..};var data = {    studentIDs: [ 14, 73, 112, 6 ],    // ..};function setupButtonHandler(btn) {    var recordKind = btn.dataset.kind;    btn.addEventListener(        ""click"",        function makeRequest(evt){            ajax(                APIendpoints[recordKind],                data[recordKind]            );        }    );}// <button data-kind=""studentIDs"">//    Register Students// </button>setupButtonHandler(btn);With the setupButtonHandler(..) approach, the data-kind (accessed as btn.dataset.kind)attribute is retrieved once and assigned to the recordKind variable at initial setup. recordKind is then closed over by the inner makeRequest(..) click handler, and its value is used on each event firing to look up the URL and data that should be sent.I hope this article provided a better understanding and clarity on the topic and JavaScript.📝 Save this story in Journal.👩‍💻 Wake up every Sunday morning to the week’s most noteworthy stories in Tech waiting in your inbox.

My First Impressions of React.js,https://medium.com/dev-genius/first-impressions-of-react-js-from-a-c-programmer-23986cfefe29?source=tag_archive---------22-----------------------,"React,JavaScript,Programming,Web Development,Software Development","React.js is awesome, but also kind of complicated…Photo by Med Badr Chemmaoui on UnsplashA couple of months ago I started learning React.js for a side project I’ve been slowly building in my spare time. In this post I’m going to share my initial thoughts and impressions.Hopefully this should give an idea of what to expect for anyone considering React as a framework.Learning PathSince I already have 15+ years programming experience, I decided to try learning React in the shortest time possible.I first watched Learn React JS in just 5 minutes to gain a broad overview of the topic.I then followed two crash courses from Traversy Media:JavaScript Crash Course (to refresh and update my JS knowledge)React Crash CourseI supplemented these with the official React JS documentation and Rediscovering JavaScript by Venkat Subramaniam.There are many longer, more in-depth courses available, but I found with the Traversy crash courses, after spending a couple of days in “learning mode”, I was able to start actually writing my own React code.First Impressions1. Tech stackSome of the tech a React developer might need to knowMy first impression of React was that web developers need to know a lot of tech!In my main work, I’m generally working in just one language (either C++ or Python), with perhaps a handful of supporting libraries and frameworks.Contrast with web, where even a front-end specialist needs to know at least HTML, CSS, JavaScript and one framework. That’s before we get into needing a working knowledge of APIs, JSON, testing frameworks, build frameworks, browser compatibility etc.A full-stack developer needs to know even more: databases, services, query languages, backend frameworks etc.If you’re planning to learn React, you need at least a basic knowledge of:Modern (ES6 and later) JavaScriptHTML5Modern CSSIf you don’t have these, it will be necessary to take a primer in them first.2. DependenciesDependency Graph for create-react-app from NPMGraphMy mind has been blown by the amount of dependencies involved in a React project. The above diagram shows the dependency graph for an empty project created using Create React App, and equates to over 200M of Node.js modules.The actual project I’ve been building is at a very early stage, yet already has 700M+ of development dependencies. It’s an Electron app, which makes it bigger than a typical React web app, nonetheless, the distributed app size is still over 350M.On the plus side, once you get in the spirit of it, having a lot of dependencies, becomes something of a bonus!It means the process of application development becomes less about writing everything from scratch, and more about finding and integrating the right network of dependencies to get the job done.Even at my early stage in my project, I’ve found most of the core work of my app can be done by leveraging existing modules, and this has saved a huge amount of time. Modules I’ve been impressed by include:Menubar: a high level way to create menubar desktop applications with ElectronReact Beautiful DnD: beautiful and accessible drag and drop for lists with React3. Learning resources and documentationPhoto by Kimberly Farmer on UnsplashThe amount, and quality, of documentation available for learning React is incredible. There seems to be at least one tutorial, blog post, video, or even full course for almost every imaginable topic. I haven’t encountered a single problem so far, which I haven’t been able to resolve with a quick Google search and a read through a well-written blog post.Due to the relatively large number of developers working with React, there is a large amount of online support, and many problems have already been solved.There is of course a lot of documentation available for languages like C++, too, but there are way fewer resources in terms of how to use frameworks effectively and build a working application.4. ToolingVS Code … one of the many great tools to support React developmentMost of my daily work is done in heavy IDEs like Xcode and Visual Studio. I’m also confident with vim.For my React.js journey, I decided to give VS Code a try. All I can say is… I’m impressed! VS Code has great support for web development out-of-the-box, and with a few extension installed it becomes a super-fast workhorse.Extensions I have installed currently are:ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippetsLive ServerOpen in BrowserPrettier — Code formattervscode-styled-componentsOn the browser side I have Chrome React DevTools installed, which helps with debugging.Aside from the immediate task of writing code, React has incredible tooling in the surrounding ecosystem. This is, in a sense, the upside of having a lot of dependencies.Tools I’ve been impressed by include:Watchman: a file watching serviceYarn: a package manager5. Rapid changePhoto by Marc Sendra Martorell on UnsplashMy main programming background is the world of C/C++ (and to an extent Python) where some of the common frameworks contain code written 15 or more years ago. A lot of old C++ projects will still compile and run, even with the latest tools and operating systems.Coming into the world of React, things are completely different. Code and resources made 18 months ago can potentially be out-of-date due to new changes introduced in React or supporting tools.This rate-of-change is a reflection of the constant evolution and innovation in the web community, and I sense that tools, frameworks and methodologies are generally improving. However, all of this change has the potential to create confusion and a very steep learning curve for newcomers, and a big overhead for experienced developers in staying up-to-date with latest trends.Conclusions: Development Speed Wins!Despite the steep learning curve and complex dependency graph, I’ve found React relatively straightforward to pick up.Having a lot of prior development experience has definitely helped with this, but I think even for a beginner, so long as you have a basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, you will not struggle with React. This is a credit to the large amounts of excellent online documentation, courses and tutorials. If you are not confident with modern HTML, CSS and JS, then you will need a primer in these first.In terms of development speed, compared to C++, or really any native framework, there’s really no contest. Even in the limited time I’ve been using it, with my “beginner” knowledge, I’ve been able to work an order of magnitude faster with React than any native framework I’ve used.I can only see that development will get even faster as I become more familiar with the ecosystem, and I’ll definitely be sticking with it!Dev GeniusCoding, Tutorials, News, UX, UI and much more related to developmentFollow87 Sign up for Best StoriesBy Dev GeniusThe best stories sent monthly to your email. Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

Web caching: From Web browsers to the application.,https://medium.com/programming-sharing/web-caching-from-web-browsers-to-the-application-22801ad4e7c1?source=tag_archive---------23-----------------------,"Web Development,Web Caching,Http Caching,Web Performance,Caching","Why cache?In the era of the internet, most information is transferred across the net over the world. So high-speed website becomes the key factor to make your software service growth up and bringing the value for the user and your business also. That requires developers like you and me have to spend up the web faster as much as possible. Unfortunately, in order to improve the speed of a web site is not easy. Are you thinking we can improve by optimizing source code, optimizing SQL queries? That’s is a great solution but to complete that your team has to work hard and have exceptional guys. Additionally, that solution just brought a small improvement.That’s why in this article I’m going to share about caching. All of us know that not all data are changed by the minute. It might be the same for a day or a week. Therefore we should store that data somewhere for later use. Doing cache is fast, we don’t have to change a lot of code and the SQL queries.There are two main reasons that we should use the cache is:reduce latencyreduce network trafficWhat we should cache?The answer to this question is dependent on your system. For the most part, there are some situations where the cache shows its benefits: cache result of SQL, caching a block of HTML content, cache value of a function, etc. We can’t forget to mention caching for web static resources such as CSS, JS, or images.Now, in this article, I would like to introduce to you common caching types and how we should apply them to the application.HTTP CachingHTTP caching is the way we control the cache via HTTP header. We can specify what resources should be stored and where it can be stored for how long. These caches can be grouped into two main categories: private or shared caches.Browser cache(private cache)What is browser cache? Simplify, browser cache is cache data in the web browser. Common browser cached resources are static resources such as css, javascript files, images, or fonts. It means the browser stores the web assets data directly on the user’s devices.The browser cache is closest to the web user. It reduces user internet traffic so we could consider this side to make your web be user-oriented.In order to determine what should be cached as private cached, we have to use Cache-Control: private for HTTP/1.1 or Pragma: private for HTTP/1.0. A recommend is that we should use both to make sure the backward compatibility with HTTP/1.0 clientsShared proxy cachesThis kind of cache similar to browser cache but the accessing scope is wider. This cache available for more than one user. That means it does not store cache in a personal machine. The cache is stored in a larger server in the ISPs’ data center or in your company IT room.Shared proxy caches are available more than one user such as all staff of a company or all customers of an Internet Service Provider. See the image below.The company should consider this cache to drive down internet budgets.In order to specify that the response should be cache as shared, we can do by setting Cache-Control: publicControl HTTP CachingTo control what to cache and for how long we use Cache-Control: of HTTP header. There are some values and properties we should know:no-store The cache should not store anything about client requests or server responses.no-cache The cache can be store things but it has to revalidate to the origin server.private the cache should be stored in the web browser or HTTP client.public the cache should be stored in the proxy serversmax-age=<seconds> To specify how long the cache should be stored.must-revalidate The cache must verify the status with the webserver.s-maxage= similar to max-age but this only applies for the shared cache(s stand for shared)proxy-revalidate Specify that the proxy must validate the cacheImportant note: To ensure the backward compatibility with HTTP/1.0 clients we should use Pragma beside the Cache-Control.Reverse Proxy CachingBefore introducing reverse proxy caching, we should know what a reverse proxy is.Definition from nginx.com:A proxy server is a go‑between or intermediary server that forwards requests for content from multiple clients to different servers across the Internet. A reverse proxy server is a type of proxy server that typically sits behind the firewall in a private network and directs client requests to the appropriate backend server. A reverse proxy provides an additional level of abstraction and control to ensure the smooth flow of network traffic between clients and serversWith the reverse proxy, we could cache the static content and dynamic content. This approach is really good to reduce the number of requests to the origin web application server. For example, we can cache the whole index page of your website.Application CacheAside from HTTP caching, we also could implement a cache to the application between layers. Common this kind of cache is store database result to an in-memory cache service such as Redis, Memcached. It effectively decreases the data access latency.Sometimes, not only database accessing is costly, but also value calculation is costly. For example, you have to make a feature that calculates the Fibonacci value. The cost for Fibonacci calculation is very high, it uses a lot of CPU resources and memory. So we should think about cache the value for the particular inputs.For making the cache easily, here is some popular cache system:RedisMemcachedEhcacheAmazon DynamoDBHbaseand moreThe benefit of implement cache in the application level is to reduce the latency between layers, reduce pressure to the database, reducing CPU works for costly functions.The downside of caching.Everything has two sides. The benefit of caching is clear but it increases the complexity of the application. We have to make sure that if the resources just have changed we must update the cache to the new one.Cache data is synonymous to distribute data. So be aware of sensitive resources. What should be cached? Where the cache should be stored? How long the cache should be persisted is three big questions to answer.Programming SharingNo sharing is no learningFollow50 Web DevelopmentWeb CachingHttp CachingWeb PerformanceCaching50 claps50 clapsWritten byThanh TranFollowSoftware Engineer, I am passionate about software development and love to share my knowledge with all of you.FollowProgramming SharingFollowThe publication to share programming knowledgeFollowWritten byThanh TranFollowSoftware Engineer, I am passionate about software development and love to share my knowledge with all of you.Programming SharingFollowThe publication to share programming knowledgeMore From MediumPlay with Chromebook — Install Python MinicondaRuyyiI Ditched Instagram for GitHub For 6 Weeks — My Experience in Three Acts.Katka Sabo in The StartupImplementing an Optimal Rubik’s Cube Solver using Korf’s AlgorithmBen BottoUnderstanding the basics of Elixir’s concurrency modelIlija Eftimov in Rollback-driven DevelopmentWhat Defines a Senior Software DeveloperRoman Zhukov in The Startup11 Things To Follow In Order To Improve Your Daily Stand-upsXOR in Better ProgrammingIntroduction to process handling in CMD and using Terminal multiplexers for uninterrupted…Sohit Miglani in The StartupBuilding an End-to-End Encrypted Chatbot With Stream React Chat, Virgil Security, and Google…Nick Parsons in Better ProgrammingLearn more.Medium is an open platform where 170 million readers come to find insightful and dynamic thinking."
How To Approach Algorithms,https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/how-to-approach-algorithms-5c45b91ec6b8?source=tag_archive---------24-----------------------,"Algorithms,Coding,Web Development,Software Engineering,Software Development","Photo by Michael Dziedzic on UnsplashAs someone who came into the field of Software Engineering without any previous background in Computer Science or Data Science, the idea of algorithms has always intimidated me. Just the word itself sounds so complicated and esoteric. When presented with an algorithm, I’d freeze up and feel a heavy sense of dread. Then the dreaded Imposter Syndrome would kick in hard — the problems seemed overwhelmingly difficult, making me doubt whether I am smart and capable enough to be a “real” programmer.While it’s easy to focus on the fact that algorithmic thinking seems to come more naturally to some people than it does others, you should not panic if you find yourself in the same boat as me. As with anything in the world of Software Engineering, dedication and practice go a long, long way. There is no substitute for putting in the hard work of studying algorithms, data structures, and methods as well as putting them to practice in your own code. There is a plethora of resources available to you, be it online courses, Youtube tutorials, books, discussion threads, and articles.Each algorithm is unique and requires adaptive thinking in order to be solved, so it’s not a good idea to just go through and memorize common algorithm questions you think you might be asked during a technical interview. That’s a sure-fire way for the interviewer to identify you as someone who’s not knowledgable or skillful enough to solve unfamiliar challenges. The very nature of Software Engineering requires flexibility, agility, and thoughtful problem-solving skills.Photo by Michael Dziedzic on UnsplashIn studying algorithms, I have found it helpful to go through the general flow outlined here when I get stuck or feel overwhelmed. First and foremost, you want to make sure that you take the time to actually read and then reread the problem. Refrain from jumping straight into attempting to solve the algorithm and instead make sure to take a few seconds to think the problem through. Ask any questions that you might have for clarification’s sake. From there, you want to restate the question in your own words in order to make sure you understand exactly what the problem is asking of you.Since algorithms are complex, it’s quite helpful to break the problem down into smaller bits — these smaller bits are much easier to understand and analyze than one large, complicated chunk. Then you’ll want to come up with a rough outline of how you want to approach the problem. Next comes the crucial step of writing your code. The first time around, don’t worry so much about getting it perfect as the next step in the process is to test your code with specific examples and edge cases. With these results, you can then refine your code and repeat as needed.Photo by Juliana Malta on UnsplashIn summary, when confronted with an overwhelming algorithmic problem, keep the below tips in mind:Take the time to actually read and reread the problemAsk any questions you might have for clarification’s sakeRestate the question in your own words to make sure you understand exactly what the problem is asking of youBreak the problem down into smaller bits that are much easier to analyzeCome up with a rough outline of how you want to approach the problemWrite your codeTest your code with specific examplesRefine your codeTest with edge casesRefine your code as neededJavaScript In Plain EnglishEnjoyed this article?

How to Use JWT for Express + NodeJS,https://medium.com/quick-code/how-to-use-jwt-for-express-nodejs-628ddf9f7c83?source=tag_archive---------25-----------------------,"JavaScript,Nodejs,Express,Jwt,Web Development","created by stories at www.freepik.comIn this article, we’ll learn how to implement authentication for our NodeJS + Express server using JSON Web Tokens. The article will guide you through the initial server setup all the way to a fully functioning server with working authentication.The article consists of the following sections. If you want to dive right into the code part. Skip to Project Setup:Understanding JSON Web TokensProject SetupSetting up DatabaseImplementing Auth MiddlewaresAdding RoutingSigning the TokenConnecting the DotsUnderstanding JSON Web TokensJSON Web Token or JWT is used to securely transmit information about the user between parties as a JSON object. It consists of Header, Payload, and SignatureHeader defines the type of token and algorithm used to verify it{   ""type"" : ""JWT"",   ""alg"" : ""HS256""}Payload contains information we want to transmit. For example{   id : 1   email : 'test@user.com'}Signature encodes the information in the header and payload. It also verifies that the message being sent wasn’t tampered along the wayProject SetupLet’s start by creating an empty repository and run the following commands. This will initialize npm repository and install all required dependencies. We’ll cover each of them later.npm init -ynpm install --save bcrypt-nodejs body-parser dotenv express http jsonwebtoken mongoose passport passport-jwt passport-localLet’s continue with creating a folder structureconfig will contain configuration variables such as database URIcontrollers contain an internal logic like checking JWTmodels will define our database structureroutes will define our API endpointsservices implement 3rd party integrationSetting up DatabaseOur database will only contain one model and that is User. We only need two fields for the purpose of this example. But keep in mind this model can be easily extended. The model makes sure we don’t expose user password when calling API endpoints. And that password is hash and salted when a new user is being created. It also contains a helper function to check if the password is validImplementing Auth MiddlewaresWe need exactly 3 middlewares or strategies. One will create a new user, which will be used for signup. The second one will check if the user exists and if the password is correct. This one will be used for login. And the third one to check if JWT is in fact correct. It will also extract user information from the token. This one will be used for securing our routes.Adding RoutingOur authentication routes will be pretty simple. They’ll just use middlewares that we defined in the previous step and return the response to the user. If there is some additional logic needed. It will be handled by controllersSigning the TokenWhen a new user signs up or the existing one logs in. We need to create a token for him/her. This token will be returned in the response of our API requests. You can see we’re calling generateToken function in the code snippet above. This function just simply takes the user object and creates a signed JWT token from it.Connecting the DotsNow that we have all parts the prepared. Let’s put them together and create one running machine from them. Here is the entry point of our server. It does the following things:Load environment variables (we don’t want to expose sensitive data such as the database URI)Initialize database models and connect to databaseCreates an express appAdd parsers to our requestsInitialize passport and routesAnd finally, listen for incoming requests on the specified portConclusionAnd that is in fact everything. If you want to see the whole example in action. Click here to go to the GitHub repository.And now is the time for a little wrap-up. In this article we learned:How JSON Web Tokens works (in case you didn’t skip that part)How to setup express server from scratchHow to add auth middlewares to work with JWTHow to secure API endpoints with JWT checkIf you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, feel free to let me know in the comments section below.

In Just 3 Steps: Django User Authentication With Social Accounts,https://medium.com/python-in-plain-english/why-you-should-let-the-user-to-authenticate-with-social-accounts-df30b0ba4793?source=tag_archive---------26-----------------------,"Django,Python,Programming,Web Development,Authentication","Photo by NordWood Themes on UnsplashWe have seen many popular sites allows visiting user to login through their Google or LinkedIn accounts and I gonna admit that most of the user's login using these social accounts because it is easy, everyone has those accounts and these are much more trusted.So I will show you 2 of the most popular social accounts which are Linkedin and Google using fewer words are more pics.ContentSetup a Django project.Linkedin Authentication.Google Authentication.1. Setup A Django ProjectI am using code from this Github repository. https://github.com/vgautam99/Django-Allauth.In my blog https://medium.com/python-in-plain-english/django-allauth-user-registration-login-and-logout-features-402ad1649e76?source=friends_link&sk=0a308d8dfef0aaa9994b4858bc3fa3deI have created a Django project where I have explained Django AllAuth Sign Up, Login, Logout, and other inbuilt features. Here I will take a pull of that code and proceed forward to save time. you can also this official docs https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html2. Linkedin AuthenticationWe will do this in 3 steps:Create a Linkedin App.Update Django Settings.pyCommon Errors.Create a Linkedin AppTo implement authentication through social service providers like Linkedin you will need a Key and a Secret Key and to get these we need to an app on Linkedin. Visit Linkedin developer page and to go create app https://www.linkedin.com/secure/developerLinkedin Create AppIf you already have a Linkedin page then add or you can create a new Linkedin page, I am creating a Linkedin page by selecting the small business page option.Once you have created page then you can add it, after this you will need a logo and your app will be successfully created.Check your Key and Secret Key in the Auth tab and select sign in with Linkedin in the product tab.In the Auth, Tab add Redirect URL http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/linkedin_oauth2/login/callback/Update Django Settings.pyadd social service provider in installed appsINSTALLED_APPS = [....    #social account providers    'allauth.socialaccount.providers.linkedin_oauth2',]add Linkedin as social service providers in settings.py# Linkedin Authentication SettingSOCIALACCOUNT_PROVIDERS = {    'linkedin': {        'SCOPE': [            'r_basicprofile',            'r_emailaddress'        ],        'PROFILE_FIELDS': [            'id',            'first-name',            'last-name',            'email-address',            'picture-url',            'public-profile-url',        ]    }}Here SCOPE is permissions that you have to provide, r_basicprofile is needed to read the basic profile and r_emailaddress is required to check email of the user trying to login.PROFILE_FIELDS contains the information that will be returned after successful login.Now we need to add our Key and Secret Key in Django Admin.First, we will create a superuser for our Django project.python manage.py migrate --run-syncdbpython manage.py createsuperuserThen visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin and log in using the credentials that you have used while creating a superuser.Now click on Add in Sites. Since we are running it in our local machine update Domain name 127.0.0.1 and any name for this domain.also, check the URL of this page for SITE_ID. In my case URL is http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/sites/site/2/change/ and so in settings.py file, I have updated SITE_ID=2SITE_ID = 2Now, we need to add Linkedin in Admin Social Applications. Fill details as shown below and choose 127.0.0.1 in sites.That’s all we needed, now just run makemigrationsand migratechanges.python manage.py makemigrationspython manage.py migrateRun server python manage.py runserver and visit login URL http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/loginCommon ErrorsNo Redirect URL foundUnauthorized scope r_liteprofileIf you are getting No Redirect URL or Mismatch of Redirect URL error then click on Linkedin in signup and copy URL, use an online decoder to decode and check your redirect URL https://www.url-encode-decode.com/you will see what redirect URL which Linkedin is using, copy that update redirect URL in your App dashboard Auth tab.If you are getting Unauthorized scope r_liteprofile error then you probably forgot to select sign in with Linkedin in your App dashboard Products tab.3. Google AuthenticationWe will do this in 2 stepsGet Client ID and Client Secret KeyUpdate Django Settings.pyGet Client ID and Client Secret KeyTo get these I am going to create a new project on the google developer page and from there we will get a client ID and client secret key of created project.Visit this page https://console.developers.google.com/ and create a project.After creating a project make sure the project name is selected in the dropdown as shown in the above pic and click on the OAuth consent screen and choose User Type external. A form will be shown where you need to fill the at least Application name and support email.After this click on Credentials create credentials for OAuth Client ID and choose the web application.After this, you will get a Client ID and Client Secret in a pop-up, copy and save them.Update Django Settings.pyFirst, we will add google social account service provider in installed_apps and then add google scope and extra params in SOCIALACCOUNT_PROVIDERS as we did in the case of Linkedin, But make sure SITE_ID is correct as shown in the Linkedin part.INSTALLED_APPS = [    'django.contrib.admin',    'django.contrib.auth',    'django.contrib.contenttypes',    'django.contrib.sessions',    'django.contrib.messages',    'django.contrib.staticfiles',    # custom apps    'LocalUser',    # alluth    'django.contrib.sites',    'allauth',    'allauth.account',    'allauth.socialaccount',    #social account providers    'allauth.socialaccount.providers.linkedin_oauth2',    'allauth.socialaccount.providers.google',]Add google in socialaccount_provider.# Linkedin Authentication SettingSOCIALACCOUNT_PROVIDERS = {    'linkedin': {        'SCOPE': [            'r_basicprofile',            'r_emailaddress'        ],        'PROFILE_FIELDS': [            'id',            'first-name',            'last-name',            'email-address',            'picture-url',            'public-profile-url',        ]    },    'google': {        'SCOPE': [            'profile',            'email',        ],        'AUTH_PARAMS': {            'access_type': 'online',        }    }}Now we need to add google as a social service provider in Admin also make sure you have 127.0.0.1 in Sites. http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/socialaccount/socialapp/Now let’s try!make sure you are logout http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/logout/ then visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/login/ here you will see Google.If you have followed from the beginning everything will work and you will see the Google account sign-in page.Hurrah, you made it!ConclusionMost of the social accounts authentication providers work in the same way, you will need to create an app or project in their developer page and get client key and client secret key, after that just update settings.py and add in Admin social application.LinkedIn and Google authentication is most used and trusted ones but if you want to add more social accounts then get a list of all support social accounts from here https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.htmlMy first blog was user signup, signing, logout, and other features like forgot password, email reset, and this blog is about user singing through social accounts so next will be on 2FA in Django.

Atomic Design for the Modern Web Developer,https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/atomic-design-for-the-modern-web-developer-4e21ec1fc5bd?source=tag_archive---------27-----------------------,"React,Atomic Design,Programming,JavaScript,Web Development","Photo by Ferenc Almasi on UnsplashIf you’re completely unfamiliar with Atomic Design principles, then you should 100% go and check out Atomic Design by Brad Frost. If you’re too lazy, then here’s the quick and dirty.BasicsAtomic design is broken down into 5 main categories. Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Templates, and Pages. Personally, I only go as far as creating Organisms and generally skip Templates and go straight to Pages.This is not going to be the end-all of end-all guides for Atomic Design, not by a long shot. This is simply my own interpretation and implementation of the theory. I have been using (and teaching) these principles for the past 3–4 years now.I’ll be using some real-world examples that I had to create recently for a take-home. They use styled-components which I don’t have too much experience with, personally. I prefer to use css-modules with less, sass, or stylus.Here’s the actual designs I got to work off of:AtomsThese are the most fundamental building blocks of your UI. These components never import anything other than their own stylesheets and React. They’re pure. Stateless.With one exception, though. These can import and use an external library. Something like FontAwesome or react-insta-stories or whatever. As long as they simplify the logic needed to use that library.A perfect example is a Button. Or an Icon component. Or an Input field. These are the most basic parts of your UI. Here’s a quick example:Atoms can also encompass some general/re-usable action/effect. One example I came up with is a Drawer. All it does is take in an isOpen prop. That dictates whether or not the component (and it’s children) are visible. The specific version of this component I created is attached to the bottom of the viewport. Here’s the code for it:These are components thatAll it does is move it’s children down below the fold if it’s closed. The parent container could probably benefit from a overflow: hidden.They can even be as simple as an extremely basic UI element. Like a handle:MoleculesMolecules are a composition of 2 or more Atoms. Generally, they are also stateless. A good example would be a ButtonWithIcon component. Or an InputWithLabel.For the project, I was working on I required two different drawers. One was a FooterDrawer and the other was a RounderDrawer. These two components were the reason I refactored out the functionality of the Drawer into an Atom.Here is the FooterDrawer:And here is the RounderDrawer:As you can probably tell, these two are identical in their functionality but different in their display.OrganismsThese should be complex and import some Atoms and Molecules. These are components like headers, footers, forms. All of these encompass a much larger piece of the UI and may even contain some internal logic/state. A great example would be CreditCardForm. Or ButtonWithTracking.These components are tailored more toward specific parts of the UI.The example I came up with was SlideFooter. While there is no internal logic or state, however, it uses two different atoms and one molecule.

Why Web Applications Are Becoming Popular Than Standalone Applications?,https://medium.com/deciphering-deadlocks/why-web-applications-are-becoming-popular-than-standalone-applications-7cd89aef16a0?source=tag_archive---------28-----------------------,"Technology,Programming,News,Web Development,Web","Photo by Taras Shypka on UnsplashThe Internet came into existence about 25 years ago and has become an inevitable part of our society. All of us are familiar with web sites and standalone applications that we have used in our systems for performing a different set of tasks, now those standalone software’s are being embedded into websites and one can use that software with a simple web browser application. These websites which behave and work as a native application are being called web apps (web applications).What is web application development?The process of creating software application programs that are stored on distant remote servers and render the software application program on the user’s device through the internet over a sophisticated web browser is called Web app (Web applications) development. The websites with dynamic behavior created after going through this procedure are called Web apps (Web applications).Why web applications are becoming more popular than standalone applications?Standalone applications expose companies and users to dozens of problems that can be solved if they move the application to the web development platform.ProblemsStandalone applications need to install on a system before a user starts accessing it.Standalone applications can run only if the user’s device has a good hardware configuration.Standalone applications’ vendors need to maintain large support staff because whenever a user faces any issue then support personnel has to be assigned for a specific device.If the component of a standalone application fails, then the whole application will crash.SolutionsWeb apps (Web applications) are installed on servers that can be accessed by users with a simple web browser which eliminates the installation time & complexities.Web apps (Web applications) can run on devices that can run a simple web browser. Hence the large software application can run on low configuration devices easily.Since Web apps (Web applications) are mostly deployed on vendors’ servers they need to maintain a small in-house support team to resolve issues on live Web apps (Web applications).If the component of Web apps (Web applications) fails, then on the user end that component can be rendered from a backup/alternative server.The business impact from the popularity of web application developmentWeb application development has brought improvements over antiquated methods of using monolithic architecture for software development as it demanded a different approach for architectural design. Monolithic architectural design-based software took more time to develop and if they had a bug whole application used to mess up. Now microservice-based Web app (Web application) development is quite popular as the web app can be debugged even when it is running. Chromebook is one such example which is using this technology.Web app (Web application) development has brought the facility to share software, hardware as a service that is expensive and used to remain idle for almost every user.Sharing resources reduces the cost as well as gives access to users over the latest hardware and software.With Web apps (Web applications) an IT team on the server’s location can be employed to handle backup, update and bug fixation so that end users don’t face issues.Web apps don’t crash and offer almost zero downtime due to the above-mentioned reasons therefore with high-speed internet penetrating our lifestyle we are being dragged to web platform-based computing.Originally published at https://www.decipherzone.com.Deciphering-DeadlocksDeciphering DeadlocksFollow1 TechnologyProgrammingNewsWeb DevelopmentWeb1 clap1 clapWritten byMahipal NehraFollowWorking in a leading outsourcing Java development companyFollowDeciphering-DeadlocksFollowA place for everyone to learn about software development, data analysis, data visualization, artificial intelligence.

Build a Simple Loader With CSS and HTML,https://medium.com/swlh/build-a-simple-loader-with-css-and-html-8eaa25183246?source=tag_archive---------29-----------------------,"CSS,HTML,Design,Web Development","The nice thing to do when your website isn’t fully loaded is to play a little animation.It lets the user know: “We’re working on it.”“We know if it takes more than 2 seconds, you’ll leave forever.”“My liege, we graciously offer you ~three blinking dots~.”Animations act like a mantra. Like staring into a campfire. It hits your brain jingling keys hit a baby. Something primitive is opened inside, and we’re transported to a place outside of time. And while we’re there, no one notices the load…TutorialIn this blog, I try my hand at recreating various loaders I’ve seen on the web. In doing so, I attempt to make them as simple as possible, so they can easily be imported into your project or you can use the ideas to create your own.The code on GithubPreliminary JunkI set up a file structure that is an HTML file, index.html and a CSS file, index.css. The HTML looks like this:I’ll explain each example in more detail when it’s relevant.I set up some CSS variables for colors (from Coolors.co), flexbox, and margins for the general layout of the demo.Example 1Example 1 has the HTML of one div, set up like this:Design: I give it the same size width and height and a border-radius: 50%;. By adding a border, you can see that this creates a circle.I style the border-top-color with my accent color, var(--loader-acc-color). This overwrites the initial color in border for just the top of the border.Animation: I set up @keyframes example-one so an element with this animation will rotate from 0 to 360 degrees.I give the #example-1 element an animation property. Using the shorthand, I set the duration to 2s, iteration count to infinite, and name as example-one.Example 2For Example 2, the HTML is a div container for three more divs. Each will be a “bar”.Design: #example-2 is given some width, height and flexbox properties to center the bars within.Each bar is given a margin, width, and starting height. I give them a background-color and some fancy border stuff for accent.Animation: There are four parts to the example-two animation, divided into 0%, 25%, 50%, and 100%.At 0%, the height is set to 2.5em, the same as the initial height of each bar. From 0% to 25%, the height grows to 5em. From 25% to 50%, it shrinks back to 2.5em where it will sustain until 100% when the animation restarts.I give each bar an animation property with a duration of 1.5s, iteration count of infinite, and connect it to @keyframes by name, example-two.Finally, in order to stagger the play, I grab the individual bars by their IDs. bar-1 gets a delay of 0.25s and bar-2 gets a delay of 0.5s.Example 3Example 3 is one div.Design: I give #example-3 a width: 5em; and height: 1em; to make it a long rectangle. I give it a background-color and some fancy border stuff for an accent.Animation: I use the transform property again, but this time I flip the div from 0 to 180 degrees over its y axis using rotateY(). Then I flip it to 360 degrees, back to its starting position.Example 4Example 4, most complex loader, has HTML of a container div with three children divs. Each child is also a container div for a single div that will be shaped like a ball.Design: The outer most container, #example-4 contains flexbox properties to center the loader within.Each .ball-container gets the same width as height to make it a square and a margin-right to put some space in between.Then, .ball-container gets flexbox properties to center the “ball” inside. This is important because as the ball changes sizes, I want it to remain centered.Each .ball gets an initial width and height of 0. A border-radius of 50% turns them into circles, and a background-color makes them visible.Animation: The animation follows the same logic as example-2 except I am manipulating each ball’s height and width.From 0% to 20%, they grow from 0 x 0 to 1.5em x 1.5em. I keep them at this size from 20% to 40%. From 40% to 90% they shrink down to 0 x 0, and remain there from 90% to 100%.I set each ball to have an animation property with a duration of 1.2s, iteration count of infinite, and name example-four.Finally, I grab each ball by their individual ID so I can add an animation-delay to #ball-2 and #ball-3. This staggers the animation.ConclusionThanks for reading the blog. I hope you found some of it useful.At minimum, I hope one of my loaders transported you to that timeless place where — just for a moment — you felt the balance of the universe, tasted a slice of nirvana, inner peace.

"Best of Modern JavaScript — Errors, Strings, and Arrays",https://medium.com/dev-genius/best-of-modern-javascript-errors-strings-and-arrays-8251e8af2d4?source=tag_archive---------30-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by visuals on UnsplashSince 2015, JavaScript has improved immensely.It’s much more pleasant to use it now than ever.In this article, we’ll look at the core features of JavaScript.No More Custom Error ConstructorsWe don’t have to write our own error constructors anymore with ES6 or later.Instead, we just create a subclass of Error so that we can create errors with consistent information like a stack trace.For instance, instead of writing:function FancyError() {  var parent = Error.apply(null, arguments);  copyProperties(this, parent);}FancyError.prototype = Object.create(Error.prototype);FancyError.prototype.constructor = FancyError;function copyProperties(target, source) {  Object.getOwnPropertyNames(source)    .forEach(function(propKey) {      var desc = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(source, propKey);      Object.defineProperty(target, propKey, desc);    });};to create a child constructor of Error , we write:class FancyError extends Error {}Instead of creating the FancyError constructor by calling the Error constructor with some arguments, we just use extends to create the subclass.The constructor has no properties of Error , so we’ve to copy them with the copyProperties function as we did in the first example.We get the property descriptors with the Error object and we call Object.defineProperty to create the properties.With the second example, we don’t have to do anything.The properties will be inherited automatically.Objects to MapsWe can use maps to store key-value pairs with ES6 or later.Before ES6, all we have are plain objects,.In ES6 or later, we can use the Map constructor to create our map by writing:const map = new Map();map.set('foo', 'bar');map.set('count', 1);We call the set method with the key and value as the first and second arguments to add or update their key-value pair.String MethodsES6 comes with new string methods that we can use.The startsWith method lets us check if a string starts with a given substring.For example, we can write:str.startsWith('x')Likewise, strings have the endsWith method to let us check if a string ends with a given substring.For example, we can write:str.endsWith('x')They both return true if the start or end with the given substring.The includes method lets us check if a string includes a given substring.For instance, we can write:str.includes('x')We call includes on str to check if 'x' is included.It returns true if it’s included and false otherwise.We can use the repeat method to repeat a string.For instance, we can write:'foo'.repeat(3)to repeat 'foo' 3 times.Array MethodsES6 comes with new array methods to make manipulating arrays easier.We can use the findIndex method to return the index of an array entry.It takes a callback with the condition we’re looking for.For instance, we can write:const arr = ['foo', NaN, 'bar'];arr.findIndex(x => Number.isNaN(x));We passed in a callback to check if NaN is in the arr array.This is more useful than indexOf since it doesn’t take a callback to check for.The Array.from or the spread operator lets us convert iterable objects to arrays.Before ES6, all we have is the slice method.Instead of writing:var arr1 = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);in ES5 or earlier, we can write:const args = Array.from(arguments);orconst args = [...arguments];with ES6 or later.Photo by 傅甬 华 on UnsplashConclusionES6 comes with many useful enhancements for strings, arrays, and errors.It’s hard to live without them.Dev GeniusCoding, Tutorials, News, UX, UI and much more related to developmentFollow184 Sign up for Best StoriesBy Dev GeniusThe best stories sent monthly to your email. Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

Seperti halnya kisah Asmara Cinta, Ada kalanya suka dan Duka pun juga. Lewat sebuah proses perjalanan hiduplah seseorang bisa belajar dan di paksa untuk memahami tentang apa tugas hidup ini. Begitu pula dengan KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH,merupakan sosok yang dikenal Masyarakat dengan Julukan Sang Raja Pesugihan dan Maha Pengasihan. Latar belakang keahlian beliau dalam ilmu pengasihan ini bermula dari inspirasi sosok kakek beliau yang dulunya sangat disegani di kalangan masyarakat beliau tinggal.Sosok Kakek yang di masa hidupnya selalu mengabdikan dirinya untuk setiap orang yang membutuhkan pertolongannya. Seperti mengobati orang kesurupan, gangguan makhluk halus, kena teluh dan berbagai gangguan gaib lainnya.KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH merupakan pribadi pendiam yang sukanya menyendiri dan bertirakat atau Riyadhoh (Puasa & jarang tidur di malam hari). Hobi beliau adalah mengkoleksi benda pusaka bertuah yang beliau tarik dari alam ghaib,banyak sekali jenis pusaka dan mustika berkhodam yang beliau koleksi. Seperti: Keris Omyang Jimbe, Keris Semar Piningit, Keris Naga Blorong, Mustika Merah Delima, Kristal Mani Gajah, dan Masih banyak lainnya. Kelahiran tahun 1978 di Jawa Timur,KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEHterlahir dan diberi nama RADEN SHOLEH..Beliau dilahirkan dari golongan keluarga yang tingkat religiusnya tinggi, namun kondisi ekonomi keluarga beliau pas-pasan. Atas berkah kepas-pasan ekonomi tersebut, KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH malah tambah semangat untuk menimba ilmu dari guru satu ke guru lainnya.Pernah Nyantri di Pondok PesantrenBerbekal bimbingan dari kedua orang tua, beliau di Pondokkan di pesantren. 7 Tahun lamanya KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH pernah nyantri di salah satu Pondok pesantren tertua di Kota Wali Demak. Selama nyantri di sana, beliau dikenal sebagai santri yang tak pernah letih mengaji dan mengabdi ke Bapak Kyai. Apapun arahan Sang Kyai, tanpa pikir panjang pasti beliau lakukan. Jika waktu libur tiba maka waktu itu beliau gunakan untuk tabarukan dan mengaji di Pesantren lain, seperti Pondok Pesantren Kediri dan Jombang.Mengembara Mencari Sejatining GuruSetelah diukur akan kemampuan beliau sudah cukup oleh Sang Kyai, beliau diberikan wasiat berupa pesan, yang mana beliau di suruh untuk Tirakat Lakon atau Olah Batin Mengembara mencari Sejatining Guru. Dari Makam ke Makam beliau lalui dengan Ikhlas berharap hanya mencari Ridho Alloh Sang Maha Penguasa alam semesta.Dalam perjalanan KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH tanpa membawa bekal Apapun (uang sepeserpun tidak punya) Hanya bermodal nekad dan Yakin Kalau Tuhan itu tidak tidur dan Maha Tahu akan kebutuhannya. Selama kurang lebih 3 tahun lamanya beliau mengembara dan disaat beliau Semedi di Makam / Petilasan Simbah Joko Tarub di Di Desa Tarub Kecamatan Tawangharjo Kabupaten Grobogan, tepatnya di malam jum’at kliwon bulan Suro, KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH sengaja Bersemedi dengan maksud Nyadong Pangaweruh marang Seng Kuoso, minta arahan dan jawaban akan siapa sejatinya Guru sejati ingsun.Alhasil, Beliau KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH diberikan Pangaweruh berupa jawaban dari pertanyaan yang diajukannya itu. Sadar tidak sadar beliau KYAI HASAN NUR AMIN oleh sosok Simbah berjenggot Panjang dan berjubah putih. Simbah tersebut berkata :“Sepiro duwurmu ngudi kawruh, sepiro jeromu ngangsu ngilmu, sepiro akehe guru ngajimu tembe mburine mung arep ketemu marang sejatine awake dewe. Sopo sing wus biso nemoake sedulur batine kakang kawah adi ari2 papat kiblat lima pancer, sejatine wus nemu guru sejatine. Koyo epos bimo nggoleki kayu gung susuhing angin,gigireng panglu (bibir globe), galihing kangkung, watesane langit jaladri utawa nggoleki dlamakane kuntul mabur. Utowo goleki papat napsu sing ngiring jiwo rogo siro yoiku Sufiah (putih), Mutmainah (kuning), ALuamah (abang) lan Amarah (ireng). Kabeh mau artine isoo nggulowentah sekabehane napsu sing ono jiwo lan rogone awake dewe.Yen wus iso, banjur nemu guru kang sejati, sejatine guru, yoiku awake dewe-dewe”.Pernah Singgah di Dunia GhaibSetelah KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH mendapatkan jawaban atas Sejatineng Guru, Beliau membuka mata dan menghirup udara sebentar. Tak lama kemudian beliau melanjutkan semedinya tersebut,kembali KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH di datangi oleh sosok Simbah Sepuh tadi (berjenggot panjang dan berbaju serba putih). Simbah sepuh tersebut berkata: Le…, awakmu gak usah wedi karo aku. Lalu KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH bertanya, Jenengan niku sinten….? Jawab Simbah, Aku iki Le, sing Jogo lan tugasku ngarahno awakmu…, Aku Joko Tarub, Reneo Melu aku! Beliau KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEHtersahut entah kemana, tiba — tiba beliau telah sampai di pegunungan berkawah yang tak pernah beliau kenal sebelumnya dan terbesit di hati beliau bergumam “Sebenere aku iki neng ngendi ?” tanpa jeda lama simbah Joko Tarub tersebut menjawab “iki awakmu neng alame bongso ngoib Le…, rak usah wedi, iki kabeh koncone dewe”.Asal Mula Panggilan KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH banyak mengalami pengalaman-pengalaman Gaib di saat berada di petilasan Simbah Joko Tarub. Salah satu pengalaman mistisnya yaitu saat bersemedi tiba-tiba ada suara gaib yang memanggilnya dengan sebutan “KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH”. Awalnya beliau kurang begitu menghiraukan akan panggilan tersebut, karena dalam benak beliau; mungkin ini hanyalah suara lewat saja. Namun, lama-lama suara itu begitu jelas terdengar. Anehnya tidak ada seorang pun di situ kecuali dirinya.Saat itulah ia di datangi sosok yang sama yang pernah menemuinya di Petilasan Simbah Joko Tarub Di Desa Sani Kabupaten Pati — Jawa Tengah. Dari pertemuan itu,KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH pun mendapat banyak wejangan tentang ilmu Pesugihan, ilmu batin, meraga sukma, ilmu hakikat, dan pemahaman tentang pusaka-pusaka mistis dan mustika yang ada di alam gaib.Semenjak bertemu dan belajar kepada sosok gaib Simbah Joko Tarub itu,KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH mulai memperlihatkan peningkatan kewaskitaannya. Disaat itu Beliau menemui, sosok gaib lain lagi menyendiri di bawah pohon dekat makam Joko Tarub, sosok gaib tersebut didekati KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH dan beliau bertanya:Sampean niku sinten? Kok Piyambaan ten Mriki…, sosok gaib tersebut menjawab, kulo bingung soale ibu kulo mpun tilar lan kulo mangkeh derek sinten? Lanjut KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH Berkata: awakmu entok sedih lan getuni lakonmu.Namun siji seng perlu mbok ngerteni, sedih yow sedih namun ojo Nyedihi terus terusan. Mulai sejak itulah gelar “KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH” melekat erat dengannya. Karena kemampuannya dalam memberi petunjuk dan arahan.Kelebihan yang tak kalah istimewanya,KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEHjuga mampu memanggil dan mengisi Mustika hasil tarikan Gaib Beliau dan pusaka peninggalan leluhur dengan khodam putih yang berderajat tinggi di alamnya. Akan tetapi tidak semua orang mempunyai keahlian seperti KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH, dan beliau menuturkan semua ini bukan karena saya pintar melainkan karena Kuasa Sang Pencipta Alam Semesta ini Allah SWT.Aktivitas KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH Saat iniSebagai seorang yang mempunyai kelebihan di bidang ilmu Pesugihan, Pengasihan dan Ilmu Hikmah,, keseharian KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEHdipenuhi dengan kegiatan untuk membantu masyarakat di Pondok Supranatural Inti Tunggal dan di berbagai tempat di Indonesia.Pondok Supranatural Inti Tunggal adalah tempat bertemu antara Guru dan Murid, antara KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH dengan Klien Beliau..

Oleh karena itu, tak ada kata lelah dan letih demi menolong siapapun yang membutuhkan bantuan beliau.KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH dikenal sebagai Sang Pakar Guru Pesugihan, Pengasihan Dan Ilmu Pelet.

Namen wie React, Vue und Angular geistern in Anleitungen herum und bestimmen Entwickler-Debatten. Ich kenne selbst viele Entwickler, die mich fragen, welches Framework sie benutzten sollen.

Manchmal haben die Teilnehmer Erfahrung im Bereich Desktop-Entwicklung. Manchmal haben Sie schon ein wenig Erfahrung im Web. Aber warum auch immer sie sich nun mit Web-Entwicklung beschäftigen, fast immer kommt zuerst dieselbe Frage: Welches Frontend-Framework? Eine ganze Industrie arbeitet an solchen Rahmenwerken und häufig drehen sich die Diskussionen um die Frage “dieses oder jenes”, was ist das neueste, und was kommt als nächstes? Es gibt eine unglaubliche Anzahl Artikel die solche Frontend-Frameworks vergleichen, mit Titeln wie “Die besten 8 Frameworks im Jahre 2020” (ersetze die 8 durch jede beliebige Zahl und 2020 durch ein anderes Jahr — du wirst nahezu jede Kombination finden). Es sind Hunderte derartige Artikel. Nur sehr selten wird dagegen die Frage gestellt: “Brauche ich wirklich ein Framework”?Ein Blick zurückLasst mich zuerst einen kurzen Blick in die Geschichte der Frameworks werfen, um die Bedeutung dieser Frage zu verstehen. Am Anfang ga es nur eine handvoll Bibliotheken für Aufgaben, die häufig zu erledigen waren. Diese Geschichte begann mit der wohl erfolgreichsten und immer noch beliebten Bibliothek jQuery. Sie erschien im Jahre 2006 und bot ein paar sehr hilfreiche Funktionen. Eine Auswahl-Funktion (Sizzle), die ursprünglich sogar ein eigenes Produkt war. Der Erfinder von jQuery, John Resig integrierte sie erste später nativ. Ein erstaunliches Animations-Modul zeigte durch (damals) beeindruckende Demos was die Bibliothek kann. Und sie bot eine Abstraktionsschicht für wichtige Browser-Funktionen, beispielsweise Ajax, die die unterschiedlichen Implementierungen in den Browsern ausglichen. Das war notwendig, denn um diese Zeit tobte der zweite Browser-Krieg und die Hersteller überboten sich mit inkompatiblen Erweiterungen. jQuery löste sehr viele Probleme und viel mehr brauchte man nicht, um eine interaktive Website zu bauen.Dann erschien, etwa um 2010 herum, eine neue Art der Applikationsarchitektur — die Single Page Application (SPA). Die traditionelle Arbeit mit JavaScript im Browser erforderte einen erheblichen Aufwand, um all die Funktionen einer SPA abzubilden. Viele kleinere Bibliotheken entstanden, die Teilaufgaben lösten. Meist brauchte man einen Router, der Komponenten dynamisch laden konnte, und einen Packer, der Bausteine in ein Paket zusammenführen konnte. Doch die Applikationen wurden größer, schnell und massiv. Das Zeitalter der Web-Anwendungen brach an. Sttt kleiner Seiten mit interaktiven Elementen wurden nun komplette Applikationen geschrieben. Schneller JavaScript-Laufzeiten und bessere Browser machten es möglich. Dadurch entstand der Bedarf nach einer besseren programmierseitigen Unterstützung. Die erste Antwort auf diesen Bedarf war AngularJS, das bereits 2010 erschien. Mit der Unterstützung durch Google und einem echten Bedarf wurde es vom Markt gut aufgenommen und es entstand schnelle eine große Community. Das erste globale fette Framework war entstanden. Statt direkt mit dem schwachen JavaScript zu arbeiten, wurden eine Menge Funktionen eingeführt, die in jeder Anwendung benötigt wurden. Die Antwort von Facebook war React, nur wenige Zeit später. Eine der herausragenden Merkmale war der Schatten-DOM, eine virtuelle Abbildung des Document Object Model im Speicher statt im Browser. Änderungen am DOM führen immer zum sofortigen Rendern des sichtbaren Teils der Anwendung. Das führt bei sorgloser Programmierung dazu, dass der Browser wieder und wieder rendert, wenn die Seite aufgebaut wird. Wenn du auf dem virtuellen Schatten-DOM arbeitest, wird dagegen mit einfachen JavaScript-Objekten hantiert. Später, wenn alle Schritte erledigt sind, wird ein ganzes HTML-Fragment ausgetauscht und genau einmal gerendert. Das bringt eine höhere Geschwindigkeit, einfachere Entwicklung und kürzere Lebenszyklen der Software. Was für eine wundervolle Welt. Aber Facebook ist eine unglaublich komplexe Applikation. Der Bedarf an einer professionellen Architektur war enorm. Deshalb entwickelte Facebook noch etwas anderes — die Flux -Architektur. Der Begriff “The single source of truth” (etwa “es gibt nur eine Wahrheit”) wurde geboren und eine neue Bibliothek entstand, Redux genannt (Das ist natürlich nur eine von vielen, aber wohl eine der erfolgreichsten).Aber dann entkoppelte sich der Markt ein wenig. Die Entwickler verstanden schnell, dass der Weg wie Angular funktioniert oder wie man mit React arbeitet nur ein möglicher Stil war. Deshalb starteten andere mit anderen Architekturen, anderen Wegen zum Erstellen, Übersetzen oder Verpacken. Weitere Frameworks entstanden, eines nach dem anderen. Und eine Flut von Vergleichsartikeln brach über uns herein.Die nächste WelleWas viele Entwickler dabei verpasst haben, ist die Tatsache, dass der zweite Browser-Krieg im Jahr 2017 endete. Chrome hat gewonnen — ob man das mag oder nicht. Aber darum geht es nicht. Es geht darum, dass der Browser-Krieg die Anbieter dazu bewegte, eine erstaunliche Anzahl an Funktionen und Adaptionen der Standards zu produzieren. Es wurde hart um Marktanteile gekämpft. Das führte auch zu einem signifikanten Wachstum der nativen Programmierschnittstellen (API) unter dem Dach von HTML 5, der Beschleunigung der Entwicklungszyklen von ECMAScript (JavaScript) und der Erweiterungen von CSS. Diese drei Bausteine (HTML, JavaScript, CSS) sind die Schlüsselzutaten moderner Browser-Applikationen. Sie sind mehrere Stufen weiter entwickelt als 2006. Und sie sind auch weiter als der Stand im Jahr 2010.Aber nun schreiben wir das Jahr 2020. Das ist ein sehr langer Zeitraum in der Programmierwelt. Und deshalb ist es an der Zeit, die Frage erneut zu stellen, aber vielleicht ein bisschen anders: “Kannst du dir vorstellen, dass die Browser-API ein Framework ersetzen kann”?Drei ErkenntnisseLass mich dies Schritt für Schritt erläutern.Die erste Erkenntnis ist, dass die famose Sizzle-Bibliothek tatsächlich fast komplett durch eine native API ersetzt werden kann. Fast, weil es einige exotische Funktionen gibt, die konsequenterweise nicht von der API angeboten werden. Der Vorteil damit gleich eine ganze Bibliothek einzusparen, ist überragend. Die verschiedene Ajax-APIs existieren nicht mehr, alle Browser verstehen eine einheitliche API. Und CSS 3 wurde mit einer beeindruckenden Anzahl an Animationen und Übergängen ausgestattet. Niemand braucht heute mehr jQuery.Die zweite Erkenntnis betrifft die bereits erwähnten fetten Frameworks. Der Schatten-DOM, den React uns gab, fand seine Wiedergeburt in Angular und Vue und Svelte und…Heutzutage ist er auch in der nativen API verfügbar. Das Komponentenmodell ist ein fundamentales Entwurfsmuster nahezu aller Rahmenwerke. Es ist als “Web Components” nativ verfügbar. Es passiert hier dasselbe wie mit jQuery. Die Browser-Hersteller versuchen mit der Entwicklung Schritt zu halten und bieten moderne, schnelle API-Funktionen. Die sind nicht immer perfekt und machen Methoden-Signatur sieht komisch aus, aber der wahre Grund für manche komplexe API ist, dass sie alle Szenarien unterstützen muss, während sich Bibliotheken oft spezialisieren. Nicht jede App hat 2 Milliarden Benutzer, nicht wahr? Das Ergebnis dieser Entwicklung lässt sich leicht zusammenfassen. Niemand braucht mehr ein fettes Framework im Jahr 2020.Die dritte Erkenntnis ist etwas schwerer zu fassen. React, Angular und ihre Freunde bieten ja nicht nur Komponenten und Verpackung. Zu den typischen Funktionen gehört eine clevere Datenbindung. Dies ist eine Funktion, die ich persönlich wirklich liebe. Auch die integrierte Formular-Validierung in Angular ist oft hilfreich. Da gibt es scheinbar keine direkt nutzbare API. Oder doch?Verstehe deine WeltTatsächlich bieten Browser einige APIs-Funktionen, die sich gut eignen, um Bindungsverhalten oder ähnliche Automatismen zu erstellen. Herausragend sollten an dieser Stelle Proxy-Klassen und der MutationObserver genannt werden. Proxies überwachen Objekte und reagieren auf Änderungen. Damit lässt sich beim Eintreffen eines Objekts vom Server (native API: fetch) der Schatten-DOM (native API: web components) neu erstellen. Der MutationObserver überwacht dagegen den DOM (virtuell oder nicht) und zeigt an, dass sich eine Änderung ergeben hat. Alles was ein Framework wie Angular hier bietet, ist eine smarte Templates-Sprache, die eine syntaktische Vereinfachung darstellt. Aber zu welchem Preis?Alle Frameworks haben aufgrund ihrer Komplexität ein Problem. Um überhaupt mittelfristig wartbar und weiterentwickelbar zu sein, müssen sie sich von der nativen API entkoppeln. Das führt regelmäßig zur Entwicklung einer Abstraktionsschicht. Das ist in React gut zu sehen, wo es jedes HTML-Element auch noch als JavaScript-Klasse gibt. Das sieht man bei Angular, wo ein komplettes System aus Compiler und Template-Laufzeit existiert. Aus Sicht der Entwickler ist das logisch und sinnvoll. Als Anwendungsentwickler sehe ich hunderte bis tausende Kilobytes an Bibliothek-Code, den ich mit ausliefern muss. Ich sehe komplexe Werkzeuge, Hilfsprogramme und Erweiterungen. Viel Aufwand für wenig Nutzen heutzutage.Nun wird der eine oder andere React-Fan sich möglicherweise mit JSX angefreundet haben. Man muss es nicht mögen, aber es ist schon ausgesprochen clever, HTML direkt in JavaScript einzubinden. Will ich so meine Komponenten erstellen, muss ich dann React nehmen? Tatsächlich ist JSX ein Feature, dass recht universell ist. Es ist am Besten in React implementiert (die haben es auch erfunden).class App extends React.Component {  render() {    return (      <div>        <p>Header</p>        <p>Content</p>        <p>Footer</p>      </div>    );  }}Übersetzen kann man es aber auch mit Babel, TypeScript und vermutlich einer handvoll weiteren Werkzeugen. JSX ohne React ist kein Problem und wer es mag soll es haben. Klar, da sind ein paar Zeilen Code notwendig, um es zum Laufen zu bringen. Aber es ist viel, sehr viel weniger als die ganze React-Bibliothek.Die Geburt der Thin LibrariesThin Libraries (schmale Bibliotheken) hatten wir schon mal — die erste und bekannteste war jQuery. Der Grund ist einfach. Viele Programmieraufgaben sind wiederholender Natur. Solange wir mit allgemeinen Programmiersprachen arbeiten, also solche die nicht auf einen bestimmten Zweck zu geschnitten sind, müssen wir teilweise Infrastrukturcode schreiben. JavaScript ist eine solche universelle Sprache. Die Schlüsselwörter, die wir benutzen, heißen `class` oder `function`. Aber was ist eine Klasse, was ist eine Funktion?Sprachen, die einem bestimmten Zweck dienen, sind domänenspezifisch. Wer eine Komponente erstellt, würde dort eher `component` schreiben. Wie viel Code könnte man sich sparen, wenn man eine spezialisierte Sprache hat? Thin Libraries nehmen diese absehbare Entwicklung voraus, indem sie für einige typische Funktionen Hilfsmittel bereitstellen, die den Aufwand Code zu schreiben minimieren. Für die Aufgaben, die wir immer brauchen, stellen sie Funktionen bereit, kleine und schnelle Hilfen. Um den Begriff etwas fassbarer zu machen, würde ich heute die Grenze bei 50 KByte ziehen (komprimierter Skriptcode bei der Auslieferung). Die maximale Zeit zum Laden, Parsen und starten sollten nicht mehr als 50 ms sein. 50 ms fühlen sich für den Benutzer noch wie 0 an.Das ist die 50+50 Regel. 50 KByte Bibliothek-Code, 50 ms Bereitstellungszeit.Not Yet Another FrameworkFür Web Components habe ich eine solche Bibliothek geschrieben und in drei Teile aufgeteilt, um ganz sicher diese Grenze nicht zu überschreiten.Basisbibliothek und JSX: 36 KB → 11 KB zippedBindung und Validierung: 20 KB → 5 KB zippedFlux-Store: 5 KB → 2 KB zippedDas was ausgeliefert wird, ist nun tatsächlich nur 34 KB groß. Und es enthält alles, was man für eine Single Page App braucht. Es enthält eine Template-Laufzeit basierend auf JSX und all die netten Funktionen, die die Komponenten-Entwicklung angenehm machen. Es hat einen Router. Es hat Bindung und Validierung. Es ist typsicher. Und Flux ist auch dabei. Entwickelt in und für TypeScript, damit du auch jeden beliebigen Editor benutzten kannst.Und selbstverständlich, es gibt keine, wirklich überhaupt keine Abhängigkeiten, die noch geladen werden müssen.Aber wie geht das? Ich habe einfach die drei Erkenntnisse vom Anfang dieses Artikels verinnerlicht. Was die native API eines modernen Browsers kann, wird benutzt. Keine Abstraktionsschicht, keine Funktionen, die nur mit erheblichen Aufwand nachgebildet werden müssten. Modern heißt auch, dass ältere Browser nicht einsetzbar sind, auch nicht mit Polyfills (es gibt einiges in ES2018, dass sich nicht nachbilden lässt). Was die native API hergibt, wird nicht ersetzt. Es kann einem gestandenen Web-Entwickler heute zugemutet werden, diese API zu lernen. Man muss sich nicht in eine weitere Syntax einarbeiten, nur um einen regelmäßigen Besuch auf MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) zu vermeiden. Wer sich für das Ergebnis interessiert, der findet alls sorgfältig dokumentiert und gut beschrieben via Github oder direkt auf npm. Der Name @nyaf steht übrigens für “Not Yet Another Framework”, denn fette Frameworks wollen wir nun wirklich nicht mehr haben, nicht wahr?Dieser Artikel ist auch in Englischer Sprache erschienen.This article is also available in English Language.Written byJörg KrauseFollow1 1 1 JavaScriptWeb DevelopmentAngularReactComponentsMore from Jörg KrauseFollowMore From MediumGetting Started With React | React Core Concepts | Props & Component.Nayeem UddinProp, Lock, and Drop itHugo RodriguezWhy you should be using React FragmentsAaron S in JavaScript In Plain EnglishDonald Trump Won, No Matter What Happens NextJessica Wildfire in The Apeiron BlogThe Election Should Never Have Been This Closeumair haque in Eudaimonia and Co20 Things Most People Learn Too Late In LifeNicolas Cole in Better Advice(Why) There Was no Biden Landslideumair haque in Eudaimonia and CoThis Is ‘I Wish a Motherf*cker Would’ Week for Black PeopleMarley K. in ZORAAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
"Technology Stacks of Web Applications, 2020",https://medium.com/@0snet/technology-stacks-of-web-applications-2020-217a59c3dfd5?source=tag_archive---------36-----------------------,"Web Development,Vulnerability,Web Server,Backend Development,Web Security","Developing a web application requires multiple decisions to be made at an early stage. One of those decisions is the technology stack. While, in many cases, it would boil down to a personal choice, the typical factors include developers experience, production cost and project time frame.The operating cost of a production environment can increase significantly when one has to deal with frequent security fixes on both the application and the technology stack. In this article, I have summarized the number of security vulnerabilities in the popular technology stacks in the last 3 years, ie., 2017–2020.CVEs on Technology Stacks, 2017–2020Individual Components of the StackSome of the popular technology stacks are LAMP, LEMP and MEAN. They can be split into two parts, server stack and application stack. The common server stacks are, LA which stands for Linux and Apache HTTP server, and LE which stands for Linux and nginx (Engine X). The application stacks are MP which stands for Mysql/MariaDB with PHP/Perl/Python, MN which stands for MongoDB with Node.js. There are other stacks available such as Rails, LYCE and so on, which are out of scope of this article.To summarize the vulnerabilities, we can either find the security fixes on individual components of the stack, or the security fixes that a stable linux distribution provides. In this article, we have chosen the former.A summary of the individual components, their version and vulnerabilities in the last 3 years are as follows,Component (Version)   CVEs   SourceLinux (4.9.1–.230)    90     ChangelogApache HTTPd (2.4)    34     ChangelogNginx (1.10+)         8      ChangelogMariaDB (10.2.6+)     81     CVE ListMongoDB (4.0)         4      Release NotesPHP (7.2+)            57     ChangelogPython (3.6+)         14     ChangelogNode.js (8.x–10.x)    35     ChangelogThe above numbers are likely the lower bound, and the actual number of CVEs could be higher. Additionally, there are several other dependencies that are integral part of the technology stack which can have vulnerabilities, such as OpenSSL. Hence, even if not all vulnerabilities are relevant, there will be a noticeable cost in keeping the production environment secure.ConclusionTo summarize, the number of vulnerabilities by technology stack in the last 3 years is,Stack   Components       CVEsLAMP    Linux            262        Apache HTTPd        Maria DB        PHPLEMP    Linux            193        Nginx        Maria DB        Python MEAN    Linux            137        Nginx        Mongo DB        Node.jsOne shouldn’t conclude based on the above numbers that one stack is more secure than the other. Given time, with sufficient development of the newer stacks, more and more vulnerabilities will likely be added and discovered.Hence, it is important to keep the technology stack of web applications updated regularly. Additionally, all internal sites should be protected by one of several methods, such as VPN, authentication proxies or SSL client certificates as detailed in our article on server protection.We provide a solution to protect internal sites, in an easier way, with 0th Root Secure Network — 0SNet. It uses TLS client certificate verification, along with authentication and authorization, for a triple layer security. It provides a certificate manager for seamless management of TLS certificates, a user manager for authentication and a role based access controls system for authorization.Know more at, www.0snet.comWritten byDorai Ashok S ABulding 0th Root | SSHBI | 0th Root Secure NetworkFollowWeb DevelopmentVulnerabilityWeb ServerBackend DevelopmentWeb SecurityMore from Dorai Ashok S AFollowBulding 0th Root | SSHBI | 0th Root Secure NetworkMore From Medium‘Cozy Bear’ Group Tied to Hacks on Covid Vaccine ResearchBloomberg in BloombergBotched CIA Communications System Helped Blow Cover of Chinese AgentsForeign Policy in Foreign Policy15 Tips To Improve Your Mac SecurityGuillermo Barreiro in Mac O’ClockManaging Ethereum Private KeysSeung Woo Kim in CodeChainWhy air transport is burying its head in the cyber sandThelma Etim in PredictThe AMSO CipherProf Bill Buchanan OBE in ASecuritySite: When Bob Met AliceNothing Up My Sleeve — Creating A More Trust World with the Elliptic Curve Pedersen CommitmentProf Bill Buchanan OBE in ASecuritySite: When Bob Met AliceKRACK: The Most Dangerous Hack Since Equifax & What To Do About It.David KoffAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Web Components — Part 1,https://medium.com/@d_rehal/web-components-part-1-e43cc7581ff2?source=tag_archive---------37-----------------------,"Web Development,Web Components,Front End Development","Web components logoFront-end web development has become incredibly complex over the years. Back in the day the only things you needed to become a front-end web developer was HTML, CSS and some basic JavaScript or if you were fancy then you would learn jQuery. But the issue ‘back in the day’ was that browsers would rendering of elements would be different so as web developer we would have to use hacks to make things look acceptable.Today, we have a number of front-end libraries/frameworks that offer front-end developers some incredible super powers, the problem with them is that most of us don’t utilise all the features that we import with the libraries/frameworks. To make things even worse depending on the preference of the developers working on a project you end up using different libraries for different projects. Wouldn’t it be nice if we could have a set of components that could be used across projects and across libraries/frameworks?NB: Henceforth when I libraries I am referring to libraries/frameworksEnterWeb Components title surrounded by fireworks[Insert Bollywood Explosions here]Web Components were originally introduced in 2011 and browsers started implementing them much later.What are Web Components?Web components are a set of web APIs that allow developers to make encapsulated components that have their own set of functions and styling.Web components are made up ofCustom ElementsShadow DOMES ModulesHTML TemplatesFor this article I will be focusing on Custom Elements.Custom ElementsThe need for Custom ElementsHTML provides a number of tags that have been serving the web well but the issue comes in when you try to get a consistent look and feel for various HTML tags. CSS tries to solve this by having a global style sheet that houses all the UI styles, however, this gets very difficult to manage with multiple developers since most developers would end up writing styles at the bottom of CSS files which makes it difficult to manage the styling.To address this various frameworks and libraries have come up such as React and VueJS that let you encapsulate/scope styles. This solution of course works well when you have the freedom of importing libraries but what if you would like to achieve the same without using a particular library or framework. This is where Custom Elements in. As a PoC lets look at how an ecommerce front-end would look like with Custom Elements .The DesignVery simple design of an e-commerce store that we will be implementing to figure out how Custom Elements work.Basic HTML ImplementationCodePen showing implementation using basic HTMLConverting To Custom ElementsWe have tried as much as possible to provide semantic meaning to the markup but there are places that the tag chosen doesn’t make sense. If a different developer was to continue this project they would would probably use different mark up, e.g. instead of using a p tag for the price they could use a div , this won’t cause any issues in styling since we are using the classes to do the styling but it does make our codebase very inconsistent, therefore, harder to manage.Instead we could convert the mark up to a custom element and abstract the implementation. So having a custom element such as<shop-product  image='https://source.unsplash.com/200x200/?shoes'  name='Nikey Shoes'  price='$40'  rating='1'  variants='100'></shop-product>would ensure that any developer creating a new shop page would have a consistent way of describing the elements. There is an added advantage of making our code base slightly more readable.As you can see from the Pen above both implementations look exactly the same to the end-user, but the below one has a more consistent codebase with less chances of a different developer changing markup in a different page. This also makes the code reusable across pages and even sites.The ImplementationTo register a custom element you have to JS with the window.customElements.define (or customElements.define)function which takes in 2 required arguments and 1 optional argument.The first argument is the name of the custom element that you are creating. The docs require that the name of the custom element needs to include a hyphen — in its name. This is usually a string.The second argument is the constructor that defines how the element will actually be implemented. This is usually a class.The third argument is an options object. This is out of scope for this article but in the coming articles I will be covering this more.The way JS is structured you will need to declare the implementation class before trying to register the custom element.The implementation class extends the HTMLElement class and as such inherits all the functions and events that a normal HTML element would have. Within the new class we only require to provide the constructor which starts by calling the super() function.class Product extends HTMLElement {  constructor () {    super()  }}Within the constructor you would create the HTML elements that are required for the implementation of the custom element. This code can be seen within the CodePen above.ConclusionCreating custom elements really helps have consistent and reusable code for web applications. This also lets you hide some of the inner workings which let developers who are not very familiar with front-end development still write front-end code.Written byDavinderpal Singh RehalFollowWeb DevelopmentWeb ComponentsFront End DevelopmentMore from Davinderpal Singh RehalFollowMore From MediumA Coding Writer’s Guide: A Simple Explanation to ‘this’ in JavaScriptAndrew Ly in The StartupSetting Up a New MacBook for JavaScript DevelopmentEric Elliott in JavaScript SceneJavaScript Promisessaravana kumar in The StartupImprove First Paint Timing With Pre-Rendered by Using React-SnapNaveen DA in JavaScript In Plain EnglishSecure Secret Storage using Google Cloud PlatformRhys Kentish in Weekly WebtipsStacks, Queues, and Linked Lists in JSGabriel Hicks in The StartupUse Promises over Callbacks, and how to create a new Promise in JavascriptSherlynn Tan in The StartupUnderstand call, bind and apply in JavaScriptHeloise Parein in JavaScript In Plain EnglishAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
What is JSON?,https://medium.com/@kmorpex/what-is-json-2725bb91018e?source=tag_archive---------38-----------------------,"Json,JavaScript,PHP,Web Development,API","JSON or JavaScript Object Notation is a format for storing and exchanging human-readable information. Although JSON began its distribution with JavaScript, it is supported in most languages, either natively or using special libraries. JSON is usually used for exchanging information between web clients and a web server.JSON StathamIn this article, you will learn what JSON is used for and how it can improve the performance of your site.What is JSON used for?JSON is a format that stores structured information and is mainly used for data transfer between the server and the client.A JSON file is a simpler and easier alternative to an extension with similar XML functionsJSON syntaxTo create JSON correctly, you must follow the correct syntax.There are two main elements of a JSON object: keys and values.Keys must be strings. They contain a sequence of characters that are enclosed in quotes. The best way to create keys is camelCase.Values are a valid JSON data type. They can be in the form of an array, an object, a string, a Boolean value, a number, or a null value.The JSON object starts and ends with brackets {}. Inside may be two or more pairs of keys/values with a comma for splitting them. Meanwhile, each key is followed by a colon to distinguish it from the value.For example:{“brand”:”BMW”, “model”:”320i“}We have two key/value pairs: the keys are the brand and model; the BMW and 320i are the values.Value typeThe values contain a valid JSON data type, for example:ArrayAn array is an ordered collection of values. It is enclosed in square brackets [], and each value inside is separated by a comma.The array value can contain JSON objects, which means it uses the same concept of key/value pairs. For example:""articles"":[          {""creatorId"":185, ""creatorName"":""Michael""},    {""creatorId"":186, ""creatorName"":""John""},    {""creatorId"":187, ""creatorName"":""Rob""},]The information in square brackets is an array containing three objects.ObjectThe object contains a key and a value. Each key is followed by a colon, and each value is followed by a comma, which also distinguishes each object. Both of them are inside quotation marks.The object as a value must follow the same rule as the object. For example:“airplane”: {""brand"":""Cessna"", ""model"":172}Here, airplane are the key, and everything inside curly brackets is an object.StringString — a specified sequence of zero or more Unicode characters enclosed in two double quotes.This example shows that the volume represents a string because It is a set of characters inside double quotes.""brand"":""Cessna""NumberThe number in JSON must be an integer or a floating point, for example:""model"":172Boolean typeYou can use true or false as the value, as shown below:""active"":truenullLack of information.""deletedAt"":nullStored JSON DataYou have two ways to store data: a JSON object and an array. The first one looks like this:“airplane”: {    ""brand"":""Cessna"",    ""model"":172}Curly brackets indicate that this is a JSON object. It includes two comma-separated key/value pairs.In each pair, you have keys (brand and model) followed by colons to distinguish them from values (Cessna, 172).The values in this example are strings. This is why they are also enclosed in quotation marks, similar to keys.Using ArraysAnother way to store data is an array. Take a look at this example:“airplane”: {    ""brand"":""Cessna"",    ""model"":172,    ""pilots"": [""Jack"", ""John"", ""Michael""]}What makes this method different from the previous one? So this is the fourth key/value pair. Pilots are a key, and there are several values in square brackets (Jack, John, Michael) that represent an array.ConclusionAs you can see, JSON is a useful tool for data exchange. It has many advantages:It can load information asynchronously to make your site more responsive and handle the data flow better.It has an intuitive structureJSON is simpler and weighs less than XML.(.❛ ᴗ ❛.)Written byKonstantin FedorovTech Writer | Software DeveloperFollow14 14 14 JsonJavaScriptPHPWeb DevelopmentAPIMore from Konstantin FedorovFollowTech Writer | Software DeveloperMore From Medium10 JS Shorthand TechniquesAntonija Dimoska in CodeartToppling the pyramidsNicholas Heal in Dev GeniusStopPropagation vs. StopImmediatePropagation in JavaScriptMoon in Better ProgrammingIntroduction to currying in JavaScriptHicham Benjelloun in DailyJS10 Important Hacks About ES6 Block Bindings & FunctionsKawser Ahmed in The StartupBuild Your Pokédex: Part 2 — @ngrx/entityCarlos Caballero in Better ProgrammingUploading Files and Serve Directory Listing Using NodeJSBilguun Batbold in Quick CodeHow to Convert Keynote KEY to PPTX in Node.JSCloudmersiveAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Quieres Redux pero con esteroides?

Sin querer, he encontrado una variante del create-react-app donde viene una herramienta muy interesante, llamada Redux Tool Kit.Toda persona que ha hecho el setup de Redux en un app React por la primera vez, y que también ha tenido sus primeras peleas con Redux por temas de immutability, entiende que el ritmo de trabajo con Redux en el inicio puede ser bastante lento. El concepto de immutability en Javascript es muy importante conocer, pero ni siempre, tenemos tiempo para invertir en comprender bien el tema.¡Vale! ¿Pero como lo pruebo?Fácil, utilizando el comando mencionado en este tutorial de quick start: https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/quick-startCool! ¿Como lo utilizo?El bootstrap te ofrece ya todo configurado. Con este, puedes empezar inmediatamente con Redux. Métodos importantes que comprendas:En store.js > configureStore() : Este es una versión mucho simplificada del createStore de Redux. Todo que necesitas pasar son los objetos llamados Slices dentro del objeto de configuración reducers y ya está.?¿Que son Slices?¿Son objetos donde se configuran actions y reducers todo a la vez utilizando una sintaxis súper sencilla, básicamente pasando nada más que functions de Javascript.  Aquí es donde está la salsa secreta que da el tempero tan chulo a el Toolkit. Utilizándose de una librería llamada Immer, tu puedes crear tus reducers utilizando lógica muteable, es decir, cuando entras en una función reductora dentro del slice, immer te pasa una copia del estado actual de la store, así que tu puedes manipular y cambiar los datos en esta copia que no estarás realmente rompiendo con la imutabilidad!!!!¿¿¿¿No es genial???? ?¿Necesitas un ejemplo?¿Busca dentro del template por counterSlice, ahí tendrás el otro método importante de comprender que es el createSlice().Probando este Toolkit os aseguro que se puede reducir el tiempo de desarrollo de la mayoría de los escenarios comunes y frecuentes en cualquier app que utiliza Redux como State Container.Quieres un ejemplo completo y funcional?

BackboneFinal WordFrameworks have become an essential part of web development, as the standards of web applications are always rising, so does the complexity of the technology needed. It’s completely unreasonable to reinvent the wheel for such sophisticated techniques -assuming that you can reinvent all that. That’s why using frameworks endorsed by thousands of developers around the world is a very sensible approach for building rich and interactive web applications. A web app has a backend (server-side) and a frontend (client-side), so we discuss both best Backend frameworks as well as frontend frameworks. Here goes the list of best web development frameworks in 2020:Best Backend FrameworksFrom RESTful APIs to complete MVC frameworks, here are some of the most robust backend frameworks in 2020 that you might be interested to learn.1. ExpressThanks to the skyrocketing popularity of Node.js, Express is quickly becoming one of the most trending frameworks nowadays. It is popular amongst Accenture, IBM and Uber, and many other companies, and it’s also compatible with other frameworks such as Kraken, Sails, and Loopback.Express prides itself as a minimal, fast, and unopinionated framework. It provides some core framework functionalities without obscuring the features of Node and leverages the robust performance of the asynchronous Node.js. It’s also quite flexible and supports full applications as well as REST API, as well. Perhaps the biggest drawback of Express is the fact that there’s no defined way of doing things, at least for beginners.2. DjangoDjango is a Model-View-Template framework that uses Python for web development. Big names such as Google, Youtube, and Instagram use this framework. Django boasts its batteries-included feature, which is a bunch of features such as authentication and messaging that Django has. It follows the Convention Over Configuration pattern and the DRY pattern as well. Security in Django is essential. Django provides techniques and tools for developers to build a secure website or implements the security features in the framework itself, like preventing code execution in the template layer. Here is our detailed post on Django: What is Django? Advantages and Disadvantages of using Django3. RailsRails is a Model-View-Controller framework that uses Ruby, and it’s a popular framework that is loved by many developers. Airbnb, GitHub, Hulu, and Shopify are primary users of Rails. Rails is considered a beginner-friendly framework, and the fact pros and cons are debated, helps beginners get started with web development quite quickly. There are many useful gems for rails, which are library-like dependencies that extend the functionalities of your application and helps you develop even faster and more efficiently. The Rails community is quite reliable and friendly, and there are many tutorials, screencasts, and resources that can help you become a rails expert in no time.The main disadvantage of rails lies in the fact that they take quite some effort to deploy and run in a production environment, and the learning curve of rails becomes steep once you dive deeper into the framework to unravel the magic behind it.4. LaravelLaravel is a Model-View-Controller framework that uses PHP, which is one of the most popular languages of the web. It’s relatively young compared to other frameworks on this list.Laravel comes with API support out of the box, and it also possesses a decent amount of packages that could extend its reach. Laracasts is a screencasts tutorials website with over a thousand videos on PHP, Laravel, and frontend technologies in the Laravel ecosystem that could be considered to be a beginner’s heaven. In terms of performance, however, Laravel doesn’t compare to Django or Express, which might be a drawback for massive projects.5. SpringSpring is a Model-View-Controller framework that uses Java, the all-time popular language. Websites like Wix, TicketMaster, and BillGuard are users of this framework. Spring possesses many sister projects that boost its performance and let you scale your business quickly. The fact that it uses Java, a strongly typed language, is a severe pro to many web developers. The learning curve might be quite steep tho, especially if you don’t know Java.Frontend Javascript Frameworks6. AngularAngular is a front-end framework that specializes in building rich Single-Page applications. It’s a vibrant framework able to build complete client-side applications, and there’s so much to do and learn in Angular. Angular 1.x used Javascript, but later releases adopted Typescript, which is a superset of Javascript. Angular’s main cons are its size compared to other frameworks, and the fact it’s not SEO friendly by nature, though it can be SEO optimized. Google developed angular, and Google, Microsoft, and Paypal use it.Here is our detailed post on Angular: Why should you learn Angular in 2020?7. ReactReact is not a framework, it’s a frontend library, but many developers consider it a framework and it’s usually compared in that context. React was the first to adopt the component-based architecture that Angular and Vue, and many other frameworks started to adopt later on. React’s virtual dom makes the dom-manipulation much faster, and it’s quite easy to pick up, mainly thanks to its JSX syntax. React could be used server-side or client-side. It was developed and maintained by Facebook, and Facebook and Instagram use it.8. VueVue.js is the new rising star; it started as an individual project and quickly grew into becoming one of the most trending JS frameworks out there. There are many cool things about Vue. First, it’s a progressive framework, which means that if you have an existing project, you can adopt Vue for one portion of the project, and everything would work just fine. Second, it also brings along the component architecture to play, and the Vue ecosystem can help you build complete frontend applications. Some people are wary of using Vue since big companies like Facebook or Google do not support it, but that’s quickly changing as big names are starting to invest in Vue.9. EmberEmber was named the best Javascript framework back in 2015. Today, the Ember community is enormous, and it’s ever-expanding, with new features, and releases added regularly. Ember possesses the two-way data binding that Angular boasts, and it comes with a lot of features and components that you can use out of the box. Google, Microsoft, Heroku, and Netflix use this framework often. Ember revolves around the developer’s productivity and attempts to maximize it by either eliminating the need for time-wasting activities or adopting some JS best practices in its core design.10. BackboneBackbone is an extremely light front-end framework that’s fit for building rich Single-Page applications. It follows an MV* pattern and partly implements the MVC design. Backbone only has one core dependency, which is the Underscore library, and it has a vibrant ecosystem, that when added to Mustache and Marionette, allows you to build complete client-side applications.Final WordI hope you find our list of most popular web frameworks useful. Don’t be scared to pick up a framework and start working on it, it gives you an insight into how to do things, and you’ll find many similarities between frameworks, even across different languages in the same category. Remember that big companies are always migrating and trying new stuff all the time, so there’s no such thing as a dead end.Written byKishan MauryaDeveloperFollow1 2 1 1 2 Web DevelopmentWeb DesignCodeProgrammingDevelopmentMore from Kishan MauryaFollowDeveloperMore From MediumUsing the Zip function in Python Part 1Aaron S in Analytics VidhyaDomain-Driven Design and MicroservicesNitesh Malviya in The StartupPython’s Raise KeywordSohaib Ahmad in Code PythonDepth First Search algorithm in Python (Multiple Examples)macnuxSaving Data From Your Web Pages to Google SheetsKent SmothermanWeb Optimization: Increasing FPS by Disabling Hover EffectCharis Theodoulou in Better ProgrammingPair ProgrammingSteven Curtis in The StartupPython’s super() methodFábio Molinar in The StartupAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Introduction to Git and GitHub,https://medium.com/@pjarz/introduction-to-git-and-github-57ac9059d429?source=tag_archive---------41-----------------------,"Git,Github,Programming,Software Development,Web Development","Photo by Yancy Min on UnsplashGit is a useful tool for programmers, data scientists and everybody else who works on a project that requires writing code. Git is a version control system that enables to take a snapshot of your code that you can revert back to in the future if you need it.GitHub, on the other hand, is a code repository in the cloud where you can store your Git code in a private or public repository. With GitHub, you can also safely collaborate on the code with others. GitHub not only stores the current version of your code but also all the previous versions.In this tutorial, I will explain the essential steps that will enable you to create your GitHub repository, add and commit your local files to Git and push them to an online repository on GitHub.There are many different applications that can help you manage your Git and GitHub projects. For the sake of simplicity, in this tutorial, we will use text commands in Terminal/Command Prompt.If you work on the Mac you have already Git preinstalled on your computer.If you want to check if you have Git installed on your computer or not you can use the following command:$ git --versionIf you have Git installed this command will display the version of your Git on your screen.If you don’t have Git installed on your computer, go to this URL:https://git-scm.com/downloadsOn this page, you will find instructions on how to install Git on macOS, Windows and Linux.Once the installation is complete you are ready to go.After opening Terminal/Command Prompt, navigate to your project folder or create a new project folder anywhere on your computer and you can start your Git repository with the following command:$ git initThe folder can be empty but if you already have some project files in this folder that is fine too.To add new files to your Git repository you use the following command:$ git add <file name>To add all new files to Git repository (new versions of existing files or completely new files) just use the command:$ git add .When you add the files these files are only added to the staging area of your project and you need to commit these files to your project to create another version of the project or like we said before a snapshot.To commit your files you use the following command:$ git commit -m ""new files added""As you have probably noticed, we use an additional -m flag here that enables us to add a message to our commit that will enable us to identify what changes this commit included. Therefore, try to make these messages brief but meaningful.To complete the basic setup we need to add our name and email to our local Git repository. This will be particularly useful when working with GitHub.To add your name use the following command:$ git config --global user.name “Your name”To add your email use the following command:$ git config --global user.email “my@email.com”These are all the basic commands that you need to use Git but once you have familiarised with them fully I recommend you to learn more about Git like rolling back changes or working with branches,To push these changes to GitHub repository you need to have a GitHub account. If you don’t have one go to https://github.com and enter your details to create an account.Once your account is ready and you are logged in, click on the + button in the upper right-hand corner and from the menu select “New repository”.Enter the repository name and description and click “Create repository” button.The confirmation page will give you exactly the steps you need to follow in order to push your local Git project to the GitHub repository.In our case, because we already have a project with Git on our local machine we just need a couple of steps.We need to tell our local Git repository where is our project on GitHub.$ git remote add origin https://github.com/my-project-name.gitAnd then push all committed locally files to GitHub by running the following command.$ git push -u origin masterNow you can continue creating or modifying files, committing them to Git and pushing to your GitHub repository.I hope this tutorial enabled you to learn the basics about Git and GitHub.Written byPrzemyslaw JarzynskiFull Stack Web Developer / PHP / Laravel / JavaScript / React / Vue.js https://pjonline.me/linkedinFollowGitGithubProgrammingSoftware DevelopmentWeb DevelopmentMore from Przemyslaw JarzynskiFollowFull Stack Web Developer / PHP / Laravel / JavaScript / React / Vue.js https://pjonline.me/linkedinMore From MediumI’ve Been Coding for One Year — This Is What I’ve LearnedJoel P.

RDBMS는 RDB에 MS(Management System)이 붙은 형태로, RDB에 CRUD를 가능하게 해주는 관리 시스템입니다. 대표적인 RDBMS에는 오라클(Oracle), MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite 등이 있습니다.이러한 RDBMS에서 CRUD는 “SQL”을 통해 이루어집니다. 대표적인 RDBMS 이름에서도 많이 보이는, 이 SQL이란 건 뭘까요?SQLSQL이란 Structured Query Language로 구조화된 질의 언어를 의미합니다. RDBMS의 CRUD를 구현하기 위해서 설계된 특수한 목적의 언어입니다. 보통 SQL의 기능은 세가지로 나누어 설명합니다.DDL(Data Definition Language)은 데이터 정의 언어로, RDB의 구조(테이블, 행, 열, 파일 위치 등)를 정의합니다. 관련 명령어로는 CREATE, DROP, ALTER, TRUNCATE가 있습니다.DML(Data Manipulation Language)은 데이터 조작 언어로, 데이터 검색, 등록, 삭제, 갱신 등 실질적인 데이터 처리를 위해 사용됩니다. 관련 명령어로는 SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE가 있습니다.DCL(Data Control Language)은 데이터 제어 언어로, 데이터에 대한 권한을 관리합니다. GRANT로 특정 데이터베이스 사용자에게 권한을 부여하고, REVOKE로 권한을 취소합니다.*SQL을 직접 연습하고 싶다면 w3schools.com의 SQL Tutorial을 추천드립니다. 직접 실행하면서 해당 명령들의 기능을 확인할 수 있습니다.NoSQLNoSQL는 Not Only SQL 또는 Not SQL의 줄임말로, 위에서 계속 사용해온 RDB가 아닌 다른 모든 데이터베이스를 지칭합니다. 뭐든지 여집합이 더 큰 것처럼, NoSQL도 제한적인 RDB에 비해 종류가 굉장히 많습니다. 이번 글에서는 NoSQL의 대표적인 유형 3가지만 다뤄보겠습니다.Document DB: 아무 데이터나 저장할 수 있고, 이때의 데이터는 같은 형태일 필요도 없는 Document DB의 데이터는 보통 json 형태로 저장됩니다. 대표적인 예로는 MongoDB가 있습니다.Key-Value DB: 데이터 저장과 읽기가 매우 매우 빠른 Key-Value DB는 Key와 Value의 쌍으로 데이터를 저장합니다. 이 데이터베이스의 장점을 살리기 위해서는 데이터 처리가 매우 빨리 이루어져야하는 곳에서 사용되는 게 좋겠죠? 그래서 보통 검색 엔진 같이 많은 데이터를 빠르게 읽어야하는 곳에서 많이 사용된다고 합니다. 대표적인 예로는 CassandraDB와 DynamoDB가 있습니다.Graph DB: 저장되는 데이터 사이의 관계가 중요한 경우 사용되는 Graph DB는, 실제로 페이스북이나 인스타그램과 같은 소셜 네트워크 서비스의 구축에 많이 사용된다고 합니다.글을 마치며.DB-Engines Ranking을 참고해보면 NoSQL이 등장한 이후에도, 여전히 RDB가 상위 랭크를 차지하고 있는 것을 확인할 수 있습니다. 그 이유를 짐작해보자면 SQL이 주는 편의성 때문이 아닐까, 라는 생각이 듭니다. NoSQL은 위에서 볼 수 있듯이 특수한 목적이 있을 때는 사용하는 것이 확실히 좋지만, 딱히 특별한 목적이 없다면 아무래도 SQL이 존재하는 RDB이 편리성에서 뛰어나므로 많이 사용되는 거 같습니다.그리고 아직 RDB가 많이 사용되는 만큼 여전히 SQL Injection의 위협에서 벗어나기는 힘든 거 같습니다. 다음 글에서는 SQL Injection을 포함하여, 데이터베이스의 보안 상의 취약점에 대해서 알아볼까 합니다.각종 피드백과 오류 수정 및 오탈자 지적 등의 댓글은 언제나 환영입니다🎉 앞으로도 저는 OCOL에서 보안과 관련된 글을 토요일 저녁 8시(GMT+9)에 꾸준히 올릴 예정입니다.

Google Drive API In NODE.JS,https://medium.com/@kamalhossain_me/google-drive-api-in-node-js-c25ffbf90679?source=tag_archive---------44-----------------------,"Nodejs,JavaScript,Web Development,Google Drive Api,Expressjs","Let’s go straight to the point. Here we are going to do the followings:Create a node.js server by using express.jsGet authentication for Google DriveUpload an image file to Google Drive from node.js serverIf you don’t want to follow the tutorial download the Source codeCreate a node.js server by using express.jsRun the followings in your terminal:mkdir google-drive-api-v3 && cd google-drive-api-v3npm init -y && npm install express --saveNow let’s create a server.js file in your project folder. And fill the file with the followings:const express = require('express');const app = express();const PORT = 5000;app.get('/testRoute', (req, res) => res.end('Hello from Server!'));app.listen(PORT, () => {  console.log(`Node.js App running on port ${PORT}...`);});Let’s go through what we have done!At first, we have imported express.js in our server. Then we created a brand new application by calling express().Then we initialized our port variable to 5000.And then we have created a test route called /testRoute to check if our server is working properly or not. Finally, we have started to listen to our server by calling app.listen().Start the server from your terminal by:node server.jsCongratulations! we have started our server successfully. So now we can check this route via postman with a get request to localhost:5000/testRouteGet authentication for Google DriveAt first, we need to enable our Drive API to get the requried credentials.json file. So let's jump into this page.Click on Enable the Drive API. If you are not logged in, then logged in with your account.If you are already logged in then it will open up a modal with the heading of Enable the Drive API Let the project name to be default or enter a suitable name. Click NEXT.Now it will say Configure your OAuth client. I will leave it as Desktop app and create. Click on the DOWNLOAD CLIENT CONFIGURATION.That’s it you are all set for now.Now save the credentials.json file in the root directory of your server folder.In order to get the token for google drive, add the following lines:const express = require('express');const app = express();const PORT = 5000;const fs = require('fs');const readline = require('readline');const { google } = require('googleapis');Here we are importing fs to access the local file system of node.js server.The readline module provides an interface for reading data from a Readable stream (such as process.stdin) one line at a time.googleapis is a node.js client library for using Google APIs. Support for authorization and authentication with OAuth 2.0, API Keys, and JWT tokens is included.We have included the required libraries. Now let’s use it in action. Add the following lines.const fs = require('fs');const readline = require('readline');const { google } = require('googleapis');// If modifying these scopes, delete token.json.const SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive'];// The file token.json stores the user's access and refresh tokens, and is// created automatically when the authorization flow completes for the first// time.const TOKEN_PATH = 'token.json';let auth;// ...Let’s take a look at what have we added so far.The SCOPES variable contains what type of permission we are getting for google drive. For example, if we want read-only permission for metadata then we should add */drive.metadata.readonly* at the end of the link.For TOKEN_PATH read the comment lines above. (Hope you have already read it)auth will contain the authentication that we will get soon from google to accomplish our tasks.Now that we have successfully imported what we need so far. Let’s use them in action now.// ...let auth;// Load client secrets from a local file.fs.readFile('credentials.json', (err, content) => {  if (err) return console.log('Error loading client secret file:', err);  // Authorize a client with credentials, then call the Google Drive API.  authorize(JSON.parse(content));});The credential.json file that we have stored in the root folder of our server, in order to read the file we are taking the help of the fs module of node.js.So, by using this above function we will read the file and call the authorize function to get the authorization from google. So, let’s write the function called authorize.// .../** * Create an OAuth2 client with the given credentials, and then execute the * given callback function. * @param {Object} credentials The authorization client credentials. * @param {function} callback The callback to call with the authorized client. */function authorize(credentials) {  const { client_secret, client_id, redirect_uris } = credentials.installed;  const oAuth2Client = new google.auth.OAuth2(    client_id,    client_secret,    redirect_uris[0]  );  // Check if we have previously stored a token.  fs.readFile(TOKEN_PATH, (err, token) => {    if (err) return getAccessToken(oAuth2Client);    oAuth2Client.setCredentials(JSON.parse(token));    auth = oAuth2Client;  });}Woo! Wrote a huge amount of codes ha? Don’t worry let’s take a look at what we have done so far in this function.At first, we have extracted three values from the credential.json file & stored them in three separate variables. After that, by using these variables we have called the google OAuth2 method to get the oAuth2Client to get the real authorization below.Now with the help of fs module, we are reading the token.json file. For the first time we haven't any token.json file, so we are calling getAccessToken function to get the token from google. After getting the token.json for the first time will just set the credentials with oAuthClient each time whenever the server gets started.Now let’s write getAccessToken function which will get the token from google, in case if we don't have the token.json file in the root of our server.// .../** * Get and store new token after prompting for user authorization, and then * execute the given callback with the authorized OAuth2 client. * @param {google.auth.OAuth2} oAuth2Client The OAuth2 client to get token for. * @param {getEventsCallback} callback The callback for the authorized client. */function getAccessToken(oAuth2Client) {  const authUrl = oAuth2Client.generateAuthUrl({    access_type: 'offline',    scope: SCOPES,  });  console.log('Authorize this app by visiting this url:', authUrl);  const rl = readline.createInterface({    input: process.stdin,    output: process.stdout,  });  rl.question('Enter the code from that page here: ', (code) => {    rl.close();    oAuth2Client.getToken(code, (err, token) => {      if (err) return console.error('Error retrieving access token', err);      oAuth2Client.setCredentials(token);      // Store the token to disk for later program executions      fs.writeFile(TOKEN_PATH, JSON.stringify(token), (err) => {        if (err) return console.error(err);        console.log('Token stored to', TOKEN_PATH);      });      auth = authoAuth2Client;    });  });}This getAccessToken() will do the following:It will show a link in the console to get the drive permissionIt will receive a code in the console that google drive providesIt will store the token.json file in the root folder of the serverNow let’s start the server.node server.jsThis will provide us a URL to get permission from google. Open the link in the browser. Select your account if you have multiple accounts. If this shows you this app isn’t verified then skip this by > advance > Go to Quickstart(unsafe).Now allow permission. This will a code to copy. Copy it and paste it to the console.That’s it! Check the root folder of your server. A token.json file is already has been saved. From now there is no need to do this same procedure if you have your credentials.json and token.json file saved in the root folder of your server.Upload an image file to Google Drive from node.js serverWe are not going to upload the image from any kind of request from the UI/postman. Instead, we are going to upload the image from our existing server folder.Let’s manually save an image to ./demo-files/kamal-hossain.jpg. You can change the folder and image name if you want, but don't forget to change them in the code.Now let’s define a post route in our node.js server by these following lines:// ...app.post('/uploadAFile', (req, res) => {  var fileMetadata = {    name: 'kamal-hossain', // file name that will be saved in google drive  };  var media = {    mimeType: 'image/jpg',    body: fs.createReadStream('./demo-files/kamal-hossain.jpg'), // Reading the file from our server  };  // Authenticating drive API  const drive = google.drive({ version: 'v3', auth });  // Uploading Single image to drive  drive.files.create(    {      resource: fileMetadata,      media: media,    },    async (err, file) => {      if (err) {        // Handle error        console.error(err.msg);        return res          .status(400)          .json({ errors: [{ msg: 'Server Error try again later' }] });      } else {        // if file upload success then return the unique google drive id        res.status(200).json({          fileID: file.data.id,        });      }    }  );});Please read the comments in the code, hope everyting wil be clear to your. If the file image upload is successfull then this kind of reponse will come probably. (I am using postman to send this post request){ ""fileID"": ""1w-wsh2nJsT0cldTf_fJnOsfdJwsuPpWzp"" }In Sha Allah (if Allah wills), Maybe in my another blog I will try to post how to download, delete or do other operations in google drive from node.js server.

Seperti halnya kisah Asmara Cinta, Ada kalanya suka dan Duka pun juga. Lewat sebuah proses perjalanan hiduplah seseorang bisa belajar dan di paksa untuk memahami tentang apa tugas hidup ini. Begitu pula dengan KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH,merupakan sosok yang dikenal Masyarakat dengan Julukan Sang Raja Pesugihan dan Maha Pengasihan. Latar belakang keahlian beliau dalam ilmu pengasihan ini bermula dari inspirasi sosok kakek beliau yang dulunya sangat disegani di kalangan masyarakat beliau tinggal.Sosok Kakek yang di masa hidupnya selalu mengabdikan dirinya untuk setiap orang yang membutuhkan pertolongannya. Seperti mengobati orang kesurupan, gangguan makhluk halus, kena teluh dan berbagai gangguan gaib lainnya.KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH merupakan pribadi pendiam yang sukanya menyendiri dan bertirakat atau Riyadhoh (Puasa & jarang tidur di malam hari). Hobi beliau adalah mengkoleksi benda pusaka bertuah yang beliau tarik dari alam ghaib,banyak sekali jenis pusaka dan mustika berkhodam yang beliau koleksi. Seperti: Keris Omyang Jimbe, Keris Semar Piningit, Keris Naga Blorong, Mustika Merah Delima, Kristal Mani Gajah, dan Masih banyak lainnya. Kelahiran tahun 1978 di Jawa Timur,KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEHterlahir dan diberi nama RADEN SHOLEH..Beliau dilahirkan dari golongan keluarga yang tingkat religiusnya tinggi, namun kondisi ekonomi keluarga beliau pas-pasan. Atas berkah kepas-pasan ekonomi tersebut, KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH malah tambah semangat untuk menimba ilmu dari guru satu ke guru lainnya.Pernah Nyantri di Pondok PesantrenBerbekal bimbingan dari kedua orang tua, beliau di Pondokkan di pesantren. 7 Tahun lamanya KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH pernah nyantri di salah satu Pondok pesantren tertua di Kota Wali Demak. Selama nyantri di sana, beliau dikenal sebagai santri yang tak pernah letih mengaji dan mengabdi ke Bapak Kyai. Apapun arahan Sang Kyai, tanpa pikir panjang pasti beliau lakukan. Jika waktu libur tiba maka waktu itu beliau gunakan untuk tabarukan dan mengaji di Pesantren lain, seperti Pondok Pesantren Kediri dan Jombang.Mengembara Mencari Sejatining GuruSetelah diukur akan kemampuan beliau sudah cukup oleh Sang Kyai, beliau diberikan wasiat berupa pesan, yang mana beliau di suruh untuk Tirakat Lakon atau Olah Batin Mengembara mencari Sejatining Guru. Dari Makam ke Makam beliau lalui dengan Ikhlas berharap hanya mencari Ridho Alloh Sang Maha Penguasa alam semesta.Dalam perjalanan KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH tanpa membawa bekal Apapun (uang sepeserpun tidak punya) Hanya bermodal nekad dan Yakin Kalau Tuhan itu tidak tidur dan Maha Tahu akan kebutuhannya. Selama kurang lebih 3 tahun lamanya beliau mengembara dan disaat beliau Semedi di Makam / Petilasan Simbah Joko Tarub di Di Desa Tarub Kecamatan Tawangharjo Kabupaten Grobogan, tepatnya di malam jum’at kliwon bulan Suro, KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH sengaja Bersemedi dengan maksud Nyadong Pangaweruh marang Seng Kuoso, minta arahan dan jawaban akan siapa sejatinya Guru sejati ingsun.Alhasil, Beliau KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH diberikan Pangaweruh berupa jawaban dari pertanyaan yang diajukannya itu. Sadar tidak sadar beliau KYAI HASAN NUR AMIN oleh sosok Simbah berjenggot Panjang dan berjubah putih. Simbah tersebut berkata :“Sepiro duwurmu ngudi kawruh, sepiro jeromu ngangsu ngilmu, sepiro akehe guru ngajimu tembe mburine mung arep ketemu marang sejatine awake dewe. Sopo sing wus biso nemoake sedulur batine kakang kawah adi ari2 papat kiblat lima pancer, sejatine wus nemu guru sejatine. Koyo epos bimo nggoleki kayu gung susuhing angin,gigireng panglu (bibir globe), galihing kangkung, watesane langit jaladri utawa nggoleki dlamakane kuntul mabur. Utowo goleki papat napsu sing ngiring jiwo rogo siro yoiku Sufiah (putih), Mutmainah (kuning), ALuamah (abang) lan Amarah (ireng). Kabeh mau artine isoo nggulowentah sekabehane napsu sing ono jiwo lan rogone awake dewe.Yen wus iso, banjur nemu guru kang sejati, sejatine guru, yoiku awake dewe-dewe”.Pernah Singgah di Dunia GhaibSetelah KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH mendapatkan jawaban atas Sejatineng Guru, Beliau membuka mata dan menghirup udara sebentar. Tak lama kemudian beliau melanjutkan semedinya tersebut,kembali KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH di datangi oleh sosok Simbah Sepuh tadi (berjenggot panjang dan berbaju serba putih). Simbah sepuh tersebut berkata: Le…, awakmu gak usah wedi karo aku. Lalu KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH bertanya, Jenengan niku sinten….? Jawab Simbah, Aku iki Le, sing Jogo lan tugasku ngarahno awakmu…, Aku Joko Tarub, Reneo Melu aku! Beliau KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEHtersahut entah kemana, tiba — tiba beliau telah sampai di pegunungan berkawah yang tak pernah beliau kenal sebelumnya dan terbesit di hati beliau bergumam “Sebenere aku iki neng ngendi ?” tanpa jeda lama simbah Joko Tarub tersebut menjawab “iki awakmu neng alame bongso ngoib Le…, rak usah wedi, iki kabeh koncone dewe”.Asal Mula Panggilan KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH banyak mengalami pengalaman-pengalaman Gaib di saat berada di petilasan Simbah Joko Tarub. Salah satu pengalaman mistisnya yaitu saat bersemedi tiba-tiba ada suara gaib yang memanggilnya dengan sebutan “KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH”. Awalnya beliau kurang begitu menghiraukan akan panggilan tersebut, karena dalam benak beliau; mungkin ini hanyalah suara lewat saja. Namun, lama-lama suara itu begitu jelas terdengar. Anehnya tidak ada seorang pun di situ kecuali dirinya.Saat itulah ia di datangi sosok yang sama yang pernah menemuinya di Petilasan Simbah Joko Tarub Di Desa Sani Kabupaten Pati — Jawa Tengah. Dari pertemuan itu,KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH pun mendapat banyak wejangan tentang ilmu Pesugihan, ilmu batin, meraga sukma, ilmu hakikat, dan pemahaman tentang pusaka-pusaka mistis dan mustika yang ada di alam gaib.Semenjak bertemu dan belajar kepada sosok gaib Simbah Joko Tarub itu,KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH mulai memperlihatkan peningkatan kewaskitaannya. Disaat itu Beliau menemui, sosok gaib lain lagi menyendiri di bawah pohon dekat makam Joko Tarub, sosok gaib tersebut didekati KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH dan beliau bertanya:Sampean niku sinten? Kok Piyambaan ten Mriki…, sosok gaib tersebut menjawab, kulo bingung soale ibu kulo mpun tilar lan kulo mangkeh derek sinten? Lanjut KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH Berkata: awakmu entok sedih lan getuni lakonmu.Namun siji seng perlu mbok ngerteni, sedih yow sedih namun ojo Nyedihi terus terusan. Mulai sejak itulah gelar “KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH” melekat erat dengannya. Karena kemampuannya dalam memberi petunjuk dan arahan.Kelebihan yang tak kalah istimewanya,KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEHjuga mampu memanggil dan mengisi Mustika hasil tarikan Gaib Beliau dan pusaka peninggalan leluhur dengan khodam putih yang berderajat tinggi di alamnya. Akan tetapi tidak semua orang mempunyai keahlian seperti KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH, dan beliau menuturkan semua ini bukan karena saya pintar melainkan karena Kuasa Sang Pencipta Alam Semesta ini Allah SWT.Aktivitas KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH Saat iniSebagai seorang yang mempunyai kelebihan di bidang ilmu Pesugihan, Pengasihan dan Ilmu Hikmah,, keseharian KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEHdipenuhi dengan kegiatan untuk membantu masyarakat di Pondok Supranatural Inti Tunggal dan di berbagai tempat di Indonesia.Pondok Supranatural Inti Tunggal adalah tempat bertemu antara Guru dan Murid, antara KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH dengan Klien Beliau..

Create your First Model DB Django!,https://medium.com/@diegobustos1229/create-your-first-model-db-django-cf662735e36?source=tag_archive---------46-----------------------,"Web,Web Development,Python,Django,Database","photo by @mybibimbaplifeAs you might know, Django supports different databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQLite, or MariaDB. Using Django ORM (Object. Relational-Mapper) we can use them by typing the same code in our models.py. In this case, we are gonna use MySQL, the default database provided by Django for local development. Then we will have a look at the Admin interface, which helps us to control visually our data. So, let’s get it started!.1- Create a projectWe are going to create a simple quote display app, to post and delete short quotes. First, let’s create a new project. These lines of commands will help you, to set-up your project quickly. For more information, you can refer to my previous post Hello World post. When we cover in detail every step to create an initial Django project.Create a Django project from the terminalIf you feel curious about Terminal command, This is a helpful Cheat Sheet by Cheatography. First, create a directory and cd into it, then install Django in the virtual env using pipenv. After that, we activate the pipenv by “shell” and create the project (Be aware of the . it helps you to avoid an unnecessary subfolder) and the first app.$ mkdir quotes $ cd quotes $ pipenv install django==3.0.1 $ pipenv shell (quotes)$ django-admin startproject quotes_app .(quotes)$ python manage.py startapp quotesRegister our new app#quotes_project/settings.py                  INSTALLED_APPS = [         'django.contrib.admin','django.contrib.auth','django.contrib.contenttypes','django.contrib.sessions','django.contrib.messages','django.contrib.staticfiles',          'quotes',#new         ]Run the server(quotes)$ python manage.py runserverCheck the project is running in the localhost http://127.0.0.1:8000/. If everithing is correct you will find Django default page.2- TemplateLet’s configure our templates and add a new HTML file to display our quotes. For more information about templates refer to Django and Templates. By default, Django always looks inside every app to run the template. To make things more organized, we create a generic template folder that will work with all apps.(pages)$ mkdir templates(pages)$ touch templates/home.html(pages)$ code .Finally some HTML#templates/home.html     <h1>  HOME PAGE</h1>Update settingsIn the setting.py specify which folder Django should look first to get the templates. In this case in the templates folder.#project_quotes/settings.py          ...     TEMPLATES = [         {             'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',             'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')], #New           'APP_DIRS': True,             ....   ]3-Class-Based-ViewYou might be familiar with the function-base views. However, once you start building more apps you will find yourself coding the same pattern again and again. That's why Django introduced the Class-Based View (CBV) model a collection of generic classes that compact these abstract patterns, making it easy for us to implement and extend. You can always check the code behind github repo. Remember that Name of classes should always be capitalized unlike functions.#quotes/views.py      from django.views.generic import TemplateView #Get the generic view class HomePageView(TemplateView):   template_name = 'home.html'Create URLFirst include in project_quotes/urls.py all urls that we will create in our pages.url.py, then create our first URL in url.py of pages app#project_quotes/urls.py  from django.contrib import admin from django.urls import path, include from django.views.generic.base import TemplateView    urlpatterns = [ path('admin/', admin.site.urls), path('', include('quotes.urls')), ]Create a new file called urls.py(quotes)$touch pages/urls.pyCreate the URL in (If you are using VS, use Cmd+p to quickly change files). By adding the * we’ll include all classes from our views model.#quotes/urls.py from django.urls import path from .views import *  urlpatterns = [ path('', HomePageView.as_view(), name = 'home'), ]4- DATABASE MODELWith everything ready to start, let's create our first database model in quotes/models.py by adding the class Quote extending the models.Model class provided by Django.#quotes/models.py from django.db import models  # Create your models here.  class Quote(models.Model):        text = models.TextField()        author = models.CharField(max_length = 200)  #Tell django to display text in our admin site we are gonna configure in the next step        def __str__(self):              return self.text[:50]As you noticed, the author field shouldn`t be longer than 200 characters using the restriction max_length = 200. Now let’s activate the model we just created. First, apply all changes made in models to our database and then Sync the database with the current state. It's possible to migrate just the changes for specific apps telling the apps name after migrate, in this case, it could be `python manage.py migrate quotes` but we just have one model so it doesn't matter🙄, if you don't call the app it will migrate all models.(pages)python manage.py makemigrations (pages)python manage.py migrate Django AdminOne of the features of Django compares to other frameworks, is it’s visual admin system an easy way to interact with data, that can be used even for those who don't want to get involved in code. In order to access, first stop the server by running by crtl+c and create first a super user by:#Stop the server: ctrl+c (pages)python manage.py createsuperuser  #Fill the form  Username (leave blank to use 'administrador'):  Email address:  Password:  Password (again):Register ModelWe have to tell our admin to display the model we just created. Go to admin.py in the quotes folder and:from django.contrib import admin from .models import * # Register your models here.  admin.site.register(Quote)Run the server again.(quotes)$python manage.py runserverGo to you http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/, signin with the user you just created and you will get this glorious page:Click on ➕add in Quotes and create your first quote5- Display QuotesThe final step is to display the quotes we just created in our home.html. First, let’s define the data to use for our template in quotes/views.py and then add the content inside of templates/home.html. We’ll use Django Tags to display the content in a for loop. Working with CBM approach we just extend ListView from Django generic classes, tells the model to use, the template to display, and how we want to call the list of quotes. That's it will wrap all the quotes for you and display them as your desired.#/quotes/models.py # Create your views here. from django.shortcuts import render from django.views.generic import ListView #Get the generic view from .models import *  class HomePageView(ListView):      model= Quote          template_name = 'home.html'          context_object_name = 'quotes_list'Add content in template/home.html#templates/home.html     <h1>  QUOTES BOARD HOMEPAGE</h1>     <ul>         {% for quote in quotes_list %}             <li>                   <p>""{{ quote.text }}"" <i> by {{ quote.author }}</i></p></li> {% endfor %}     </ul>Go to your http://localhost:8000/ and you will seeTo Sum UpWe created our first app using a database model by following the URL -> View -> Model -> Template methodology, as usual, we created the URL and view class to link to our model. Then, we had a first look at the admin interface, very useful to handle the content. Remember to run makemigrations first and then migrate to apply all changes in models. And finally, we displayed the content using Django HTML tags.I hope this tutorial had been useful for you, follow the final code in this repository if you have any comment sdon’t hesitate to contact me in DIEGOBUSTOSDEV.COM or Linkedin. clap clap clap as many times as you want! 👏🏼👏🏼Written byDiego Bustos$ ~/ Web developer based in Vancouver!

Seperti halnya kisah Asmara Cinta, Ada kalanya suka dan Duka pun juga. Lewat sebuah proses perjalanan hiduplah seseorang bisa belajar dan di paksa untuk memahami tentang apa tugas hidup ini. Begitu pula dengan KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH,merupakan sosok yang dikenal Masyarakat dengan Julukan Sang Raja Pesugihan dan Maha Pengasihan. Latar belakang keahlian beliau dalam ilmu pengasihan ini bermula dari inspirasi sosok kakek beliau yang dulunya sangat disegani di kalangan masyarakat beliau tinggal.Sosok Kakek yang di masa hidupnya selalu mengabdikan dirinya untuk setiap orang yang membutuhkan pertolongannya. Seperti mengobati orang kesurupan, gangguan makhluk halus, kena teluh dan berbagai gangguan gaib lainnya.KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH merupakan pribadi pendiam yang sukanya menyendiri dan bertirakat atau Riyadhoh (Puasa & jarang tidur di malam hari). Hobi beliau adalah mengkoleksi benda pusaka bertuah yang beliau tarik dari alam ghaib,banyak sekali jenis pusaka dan mustika berkhodam yang beliau koleksi. Seperti: Keris Omyang Jimbe, Keris Semar Piningit, Keris Naga Blorong, Mustika Merah Delima, Kristal Mani Gajah, dan Masih banyak lainnya. Kelahiran tahun 1978 di Jawa Timur,KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEHterlahir dan diberi nama RADEN SHOLEH..Beliau dilahirkan dari golongan keluarga yang tingkat religiusnya tinggi, namun kondisi ekonomi keluarga beliau pas-pasan. Atas berkah kepas-pasan ekonomi tersebut, KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH malah tambah semangat untuk menimba ilmu dari guru satu ke guru lainnya.Pernah Nyantri di Pondok PesantrenBerbekal bimbingan dari kedua orang tua, beliau di Pondokkan di pesantren. 7 Tahun lamanya KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH pernah nyantri di salah satu Pondok pesantren tertua di Kota Wali Demak. Selama nyantri di sana, beliau dikenal sebagai santri yang tak pernah letih mengaji dan mengabdi ke Bapak Kyai. Apapun arahan Sang Kyai, tanpa pikir panjang pasti beliau lakukan. Jika waktu libur tiba maka waktu itu beliau gunakan untuk tabarukan dan mengaji di Pesantren lain, seperti Pondok Pesantren Kediri dan Jombang.Mengembara Mencari Sejatining GuruSetelah diukur akan kemampuan beliau sudah cukup oleh Sang Kyai, beliau diberikan wasiat berupa pesan, yang mana beliau di suruh untuk Tirakat Lakon atau Olah Batin Mengembara mencari Sejatining Guru. Dari Makam ke Makam beliau lalui dengan Ikhlas berharap hanya mencari Ridho Alloh Sang Maha Penguasa alam semesta.Dalam perjalanan KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH tanpa membawa bekal Apapun (uang sepeserpun tidak punya) Hanya bermodal nekad dan Yakin Kalau Tuhan itu tidak tidur dan Maha Tahu akan kebutuhannya. Selama kurang lebih 3 tahun lamanya beliau mengembara dan disaat beliau Semedi di Makam / Petilasan Simbah Joko Tarub di Di Desa Tarub Kecamatan Tawangharjo Kabupaten Grobogan, tepatnya di malam jum’at kliwon bulan Suro, KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH sengaja Bersemedi dengan maksud Nyadong Pangaweruh marang Seng Kuoso, minta arahan dan jawaban akan siapa sejatinya Guru sejati ingsun.Alhasil, Beliau KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH diberikan Pangaweruh berupa jawaban dari pertanyaan yang diajukannya itu. Sadar tidak sadar beliau KYAI HASAN NUR AMIN oleh sosok Simbah berjenggot Panjang dan berjubah putih. Simbah tersebut berkata :“Sepiro duwurmu ngudi kawruh, sepiro jeromu ngangsu ngilmu, sepiro akehe guru ngajimu tembe mburine mung arep ketemu marang sejatine awake dewe. Sopo sing wus biso nemoake sedulur batine kakang kawah adi ari2 papat kiblat lima pancer, sejatine wus nemu guru sejatine. Koyo epos bimo nggoleki kayu gung susuhing angin,gigireng panglu (bibir globe), galihing kangkung, watesane langit jaladri utawa nggoleki dlamakane kuntul mabur. Utowo goleki papat napsu sing ngiring jiwo rogo siro yoiku Sufiah (putih), Mutmainah (kuning), ALuamah (abang) lan Amarah (ireng). Kabeh mau artine isoo nggulowentah sekabehane napsu sing ono jiwo lan rogone awake dewe.Yen wus iso, banjur nemu guru kang sejati, sejatine guru, yoiku awake dewe-dewe”.Pernah Singgah di Dunia GhaibSetelah KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH mendapatkan jawaban atas Sejatineng Guru, Beliau membuka mata dan menghirup udara sebentar. Tak lama kemudian beliau melanjutkan semedinya tersebut,kembali KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH di datangi oleh sosok Simbah Sepuh tadi (berjenggot panjang dan berbaju serba putih). Simbah sepuh tersebut berkata: Le…, awakmu gak usah wedi karo aku. Lalu KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH bertanya, Jenengan niku sinten….? Jawab Simbah, Aku iki Le, sing Jogo lan tugasku ngarahno awakmu…, Aku Joko Tarub, Reneo Melu aku! Beliau KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEHtersahut entah kemana, tiba — tiba beliau telah sampai di pegunungan berkawah yang tak pernah beliau kenal sebelumnya dan terbesit di hati beliau bergumam “Sebenere aku iki neng ngendi ?” tanpa jeda lama simbah Joko Tarub tersebut menjawab “iki awakmu neng alame bongso ngoib Le…, rak usah wedi, iki kabeh koncone dewe”.Asal Mula Panggilan KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH banyak mengalami pengalaman-pengalaman Gaib di saat berada di petilasan Simbah Joko Tarub. Salah satu pengalaman mistisnya yaitu saat bersemedi tiba-tiba ada suara gaib yang memanggilnya dengan sebutan “KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH”. Awalnya beliau kurang begitu menghiraukan akan panggilan tersebut, karena dalam benak beliau; mungkin ini hanyalah suara lewat saja. Namun, lama-lama suara itu begitu jelas terdengar. Anehnya tidak ada seorang pun di situ kecuali dirinya.Saat itulah ia di datangi sosok yang sama yang pernah menemuinya di Petilasan Simbah Joko Tarub Di Desa Sani Kabupaten Pati — Jawa Tengah. Dari pertemuan itu,KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH pun mendapat banyak wejangan tentang ilmu Pesugihan, ilmu batin, meraga sukma, ilmu hakikat, dan pemahaman tentang pusaka-pusaka mistis dan mustika yang ada di alam gaib.Semenjak bertemu dan belajar kepada sosok gaib Simbah Joko Tarub itu,KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH mulai memperlihatkan peningkatan kewaskitaannya. Disaat itu Beliau menemui, sosok gaib lain lagi menyendiri di bawah pohon dekat makam Joko Tarub, sosok gaib tersebut didekati KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH dan beliau bertanya:Sampean niku sinten? Kok Piyambaan ten Mriki…, sosok gaib tersebut menjawab, kulo bingung soale ibu kulo mpun tilar lan kulo mangkeh derek sinten? Lanjut KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH Berkata: awakmu entok sedih lan getuni lakonmu.Namun siji seng perlu mbok ngerteni, sedih yow sedih namun ojo Nyedihi terus terusan. Mulai sejak itulah gelar “KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH” melekat erat dengannya. Karena kemampuannya dalam memberi petunjuk dan arahan.Kelebihan yang tak kalah istimewanya,KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEHjuga mampu memanggil dan mengisi Mustika hasil tarikan Gaib Beliau dan pusaka peninggalan leluhur dengan khodam putih yang berderajat tinggi di alamnya. Akan tetapi tidak semua orang mempunyai keahlian seperti KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH, dan beliau menuturkan semua ini bukan karena saya pintar melainkan karena Kuasa Sang Pencipta Alam Semesta ini Allah SWT.Aktivitas KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH Saat iniSebagai seorang yang mempunyai kelebihan di bidang ilmu Pesugihan, Pengasihan dan Ilmu Hikmah,, keseharian KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEHdipenuhi dengan kegiatan untuk membantu masyarakat di Pondok Supranatural Inti Tunggal dan di berbagai tempat di Indonesia.Pondok Supranatural Inti Tunggal adalah tempat bertemu antara Guru dan Murid, antara KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH dengan Klien Beliau.. Beliau juga sering mendapat undangan khusus untuk memimpin ritual dan ruwatan di berbagai tempat. Bagi beliau, semulia-mulianya manusia adalah manusia yang bisa bermanfaat bagi manusia lainnya. Oleh karena itu, tak ada kata lelah dan letih demi menolong siapapun yang membutuhkan bantuan beliau.KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH dikenal sebagai Sang Pakar Guru Pesugihan, Pengasihan Dan Ilmu Pelet. Beliau juga menjabat sebagai Pengasuh Pondok Supranatural Inti Tunggal di Desa Tampaksiring, Susut Gianyar Kota Malang Jawa Timur.Sekarang.. Jika Anda Punya Masalah Seputar Keuangan ??

Atas berkah kepas-pasan ekonomi tersebut, KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH malah tambah semangat untuk menimba ilmu dari guru satu ke guru lainnya.Pernah Nyantri di Pondok PesantrenBerbekal bimbingan dari kedua orang tua, beliau di Pondokkan di pesantren. 7 Tahun lamanya KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH pernah nyantri di salah satu Pondok pesantren tertua di Kota Wali Demak. Selama nyantri di sana, beliau dikenal sebagai santri yang tak pernah letih mengaji dan mengabdi ke Bapak Kyai. Apapun arahan Sang Kyai, tanpa pikir panjang pasti beliau lakukan. Jika waktu libur tiba maka waktu itu beliau gunakan untuk tabarukan dan mengaji di Pesantren lain, seperti Pondok Pesantren Kediri dan Jombang.Mengembara Mencari Sejatining GuruSetelah diukur akan kemampuan beliau sudah cukup oleh Sang Kyai, beliau diberikan wasiat berupa pesan, yang mana beliau di suruh untuk Tirakat Lakon atau Olah Batin Mengembara mencari Sejatining Guru. Dari Makam ke Makam beliau lalui dengan Ikhlas berharap hanya mencari Ridho Alloh Sang Maha Penguasa alam semesta.Dalam perjalanan KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH tanpa membawa bekal Apapun (uang sepeserpun tidak punya) Hanya bermodal nekad dan Yakin Kalau Tuhan itu tidak tidur dan Maha Tahu akan kebutuhannya. Selama kurang lebih 3 tahun lamanya beliau mengembara dan disaat beliau Semedi di Makam / Petilasan Simbah Joko Tarub di Di Desa Tarub Kecamatan Tawangharjo Kabupaten Grobogan, tepatnya di malam jum’at kliwon bulan Suro, KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH sengaja Bersemedi dengan maksud Nyadong Pangaweruh marang Seng Kuoso, minta arahan dan jawaban akan siapa sejatinya Guru sejati ingsun.Alhasil, Beliau KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH diberikan Pangaweruh berupa jawaban dari pertanyaan yang diajukannya itu. Sadar tidak sadar beliau KYAI HASAN NUR AMIN oleh sosok Simbah berjenggot Panjang dan berjubah putih. Simbah tersebut berkata :“Sepiro duwurmu ngudi kawruh, sepiro jeromu ngangsu ngilmu, sepiro akehe guru ngajimu tembe mburine mung arep ketemu marang sejatine awake dewe. Sopo sing wus biso nemoake sedulur batine kakang kawah adi ari2 papat kiblat lima pancer, sejatine wus nemu guru sejatine. Koyo epos bimo nggoleki kayu gung susuhing angin,gigireng panglu (bibir globe), galihing kangkung, watesane langit jaladri utawa nggoleki dlamakane kuntul mabur.

Kabeh mau artine isoo nggulowentah sekabehane napsu sing ono jiwo lan rogone awake dewe.Yen wus iso, banjur nemu guru kang sejati, sejatine guru, yoiku awake dewe-dewe”.Pernah Singgah di Dunia GhaibSetelah KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH mendapatkan jawaban atas Sejatineng Guru, Beliau membuka mata dan menghirup udara sebentar.

Jawab Simbah, Aku iki Le, sing Jogo lan tugasku ngarahno awakmu…, Aku Joko Tarub, Reneo Melu aku! Beliau KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEHtersahut entah kemana, tiba — tiba beliau telah sampai di pegunungan berkawah yang tak pernah beliau kenal sebelumnya dan terbesit di hati beliau bergumam “Sebenere aku iki neng ngendi ?” tanpa jeda lama simbah Joko Tarub tersebut menjawab “iki awakmu neng alame bongso ngoib Le…, rak usah wedi, iki kabeh koncone dewe”.Asal Mula Panggilan KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH banyak mengalami pengalaman-pengalaman Gaib di saat berada di petilasan Simbah Joko Tarub. Salah satu pengalaman mistisnya yaitu saat bersemedi tiba-tiba ada suara gaib yang memanggilnya dengan sebutan “KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH”. Awalnya beliau kurang begitu menghiraukan akan panggilan tersebut, karena dalam benak beliau; mungkin ini hanyalah suara lewat saja. Namun, lama-lama suara itu begitu jelas terdengar. Anehnya tidak ada seorang pun di situ kecuali dirinya.Saat itulah ia di datangi sosok yang sama yang pernah menemuinya di Petilasan Simbah Joko Tarub Di Desa Sani Kabupaten Pati — Jawa Tengah.

Disaat itu Beliau menemui, sosok gaib lain lagi menyendiri di bawah pohon dekat makam Joko Tarub, sosok gaib tersebut didekati KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH dan beliau bertanya:Sampean niku sinten? Kok Piyambaan ten Mriki…, sosok gaib tersebut menjawab, kulo bingung soale ibu kulo mpun tilar lan kulo mangkeh derek sinten? Lanjut KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH Berkata: awakmu entok sedih lan getuni lakonmu.Namun siji seng perlu mbok ngerteni, sedih yow sedih namun ojo Nyedihi terus terusan.

Karena kemampuannya dalam memberi petunjuk dan arahan.Kelebihan yang tak kalah istimewanya,KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEHjuga mampu memanggil dan mengisi Mustika hasil tarikan Gaib Beliau dan pusaka peninggalan leluhur dengan khodam putih yang berderajat tinggi di alamnya.

Selama nyantri di sana, beliau dikenal sebagai santri yang tak pernah letih mengaji dan mengabdi ke Bapak Kyai. Apapun arahan Sang Kyai, tanpa pikir panjang pasti beliau lakukan. Jika waktu libur tiba maka waktu itu beliau gunakan untuk tabarukan dan mengaji di Pesantren lain, seperti Pondok Pesantren Kediri dan Jombang.Mengembara Mencari Sejatining GuruSetelah diukur akan kemampuan beliau sudah cukup oleh Sang Kyai, beliau diberikan wasiat berupa pesan, yang mana beliau di suruh untuk Tirakat Lakon atau Olah Batin Mengembara mencari Sejatining Guru. Dari Makam ke Makam beliau lalui dengan Ikhlas berharap hanya mencari Ridho Alloh Sang Maha Penguasa alam semesta.Dalam perjalanan KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH tanpa membawa bekal Apapun (uang sepeserpun tidak punya) Hanya bermodal nekad dan Yakin Kalau Tuhan itu tidak tidur dan Maha Tahu akan kebutuhannya. Selama kurang lebih 3 tahun lamanya beliau mengembara dan disaat beliau Semedi di Makam / Petilasan Simbah Joko Tarub di Di Desa Tarub Kecamatan Tawangharjo Kabupaten Grobogan, tepatnya di malam jum’at kliwon bulan Suro, KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH sengaja Bersemedi dengan maksud Nyadong Pangaweruh marang Seng Kuoso, minta arahan dan jawaban akan siapa sejatinya Guru sejati ingsun.Alhasil, Beliau KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH diberikan Pangaweruh berupa jawaban dari pertanyaan yang diajukannya itu. Sadar tidak sadar beliau KYAI HASAN NUR AMIN oleh sosok Simbah berjenggot Panjang dan berjubah putih. Simbah tersebut berkata :“Sepiro duwurmu ngudi kawruh, sepiro jeromu ngangsu ngilmu, sepiro akehe guru ngajimu tembe mburine mung arep ketemu marang sejatine awake dewe. Sopo sing wus biso nemoake sedulur batine kakang kawah adi ari2 papat kiblat lima pancer, sejatine wus nemu guru sejatine. Koyo epos bimo nggoleki kayu gung susuhing angin,gigireng panglu (bibir globe), galihing kangkung, watesane langit jaladri utawa nggoleki dlamakane kuntul mabur. Utowo goleki papat napsu sing ngiring jiwo rogo siro yoiku Sufiah (putih), Mutmainah (kuning), ALuamah (abang) lan Amarah (ireng). Kabeh mau artine isoo nggulowentah sekabehane napsu sing ono jiwo lan rogone awake dewe.Yen wus iso, banjur nemu guru kang sejati, sejatine guru, yoiku awake dewe-dewe”.Pernah Singgah di Dunia GhaibSetelah KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH mendapatkan jawaban atas Sejatineng Guru, Beliau membuka mata dan menghirup udara sebentar. Tak lama kemudian beliau melanjutkan semedinya tersebut,kembali KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH di datangi oleh sosok Simbah Sepuh tadi (berjenggot panjang dan berbaju serba putih). Simbah sepuh tersebut berkata: Le…, awakmu gak usah wedi karo aku. Lalu KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH bertanya, Jenengan niku sinten….? Jawab Simbah, Aku iki Le, sing Jogo lan tugasku ngarahno awakmu…, Aku Joko Tarub, Reneo Melu aku! Beliau KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEHtersahut entah kemana, tiba — tiba beliau telah sampai di pegunungan berkawah yang tak pernah beliau kenal sebelumnya dan terbesit di hati beliau bergumam “Sebenere aku iki neng ngendi ?” tanpa jeda lama simbah Joko Tarub tersebut menjawab “iki awakmu neng alame bongso ngoib Le…, rak usah wedi, iki kabeh koncone dewe”.Asal Mula Panggilan KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH banyak mengalami pengalaman-pengalaman Gaib di saat berada di petilasan Simbah Joko Tarub. Salah satu pengalaman mistisnya yaitu saat bersemedi tiba-tiba ada suara gaib yang memanggilnya dengan sebutan “KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH”. Awalnya beliau kurang begitu menghiraukan akan panggilan tersebut, karena dalam benak beliau; mungkin ini hanyalah suara lewat saja. Namun, lama-lama suara itu begitu jelas terdengar. Anehnya tidak ada seorang pun di situ kecuali dirinya.Saat itulah ia di datangi sosok yang sama yang pernah menemuinya di Petilasan Simbah Joko Tarub Di Desa Sani Kabupaten Pati — Jawa Tengah. Dari pertemuan itu,KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH pun mendapat banyak wejangan tentang ilmu Pesugihan, ilmu batin, meraga sukma, ilmu hakikat, dan pemahaman tentang pusaka-pusaka mistis dan mustika yang ada di alam gaib.Semenjak bertemu dan belajar kepada sosok gaib Simbah Joko Tarub itu,KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH mulai memperlihatkan peningkatan kewaskitaannya. Disaat itu Beliau menemui, sosok gaib lain lagi menyendiri di bawah pohon dekat makam Joko Tarub, sosok gaib tersebut didekati KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH dan beliau bertanya:Sampean niku sinten? Kok Piyambaan ten Mriki…, sosok gaib tersebut menjawab, kulo bingung soale ibu kulo mpun tilar lan kulo mangkeh derek sinten? Lanjut KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH Berkata: awakmu entok sedih lan getuni lakonmu.Namun siji seng perlu mbok ngerteni, sedih yow sedih namun ojo Nyedihi terus terusan. Mulai sejak itulah gelar “KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH” melekat erat dengannya. Karena kemampuannya dalam memberi petunjuk dan arahan.Kelebihan yang tak kalah istimewanya,KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEHjuga mampu memanggil dan mengisi Mustika hasil tarikan Gaib Beliau dan pusaka peninggalan leluhur dengan khodam putih yang berderajat tinggi di alamnya. Akan tetapi tidak semua orang mempunyai keahlian seperti KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH, dan beliau menuturkan semua ini bukan karena saya pintar melainkan karena Kuasa Sang Pencipta Alam Semesta ini Allah SWT.Aktivitas KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH Saat iniSebagai seorang yang mempunyai kelebihan di bidang ilmu Pesugihan, Pengasihan dan Ilmu Hikmah,, keseharian KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEHdipenuhi dengan kegiatan untuk membantu masyarakat di Pondok Supranatural Inti Tunggal dan di berbagai tempat di Indonesia.Pondok Supranatural Inti Tunggal adalah tempat bertemu antara Guru dan Murid, antara KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH dengan Klien Beliau..

CSS Pseudo-classes explained,https://medium.com/@admildo68/css-pseudo-classes-explained-7648c37256fa?source=tag_archive---------56-----------------------,"CSS,Coding,Tutorial,Web Development,Programming","CSS code showing pseudo-classes in actionWhat are pseudo-classes used for after all ?A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element. we can used it to define a style for an element ,when it’s in a certain state like clicked , hovered ,focused and etc.Pseudo-class syntaxselector:pseudo-class { property: value;}a:hover { color:red;}A css pseudo-class CheatsheetPseudo-class CheatsheetLink pseudo class selectors:link — This selects a <a> that has an href attribute defined .:visited – Selects links that have already been visited by the current browser.:hover – When the mouse cursor rolls over a link, that link is in it’s hover state and this will select it.:active – Selects the link while it is being activated (being clicked on or otherwise activated). For example, for the “pressed” state of a button-style link or to make all links feel more button-like.Input & link pseudo class selectors:focus — This pseudo class will select links that are the current focus of the keyboard. This is not limited to links, but can be used on inputs and textareas as well. Some would tell you to define a :focus style for anything that has a :hover style.:target – The target pseudo class is used in conjunction with IDs, and match when the hash tag in the current URL matches that ID. So if you are at URL www.yoursite.com/#home then the selector #home:target will match. That can be extremely powerful.:enabled – Selects inputs that are in the default state of enabled and ready to be used.:disabled – Selects inputs that have the disabled attribute. A lot of browsers will make the input a faded out gray, you can control that with this selector.:checked – Selects checkboxes that are, wait for it, checked.:indeterminate – Selects radio buttons that are in the purgatory state of neither chosen or unchosen (like when a page loads with radio button choices but no default is set).:required – Selects inputs with the required attribute.:optional – Selects inputs that do not have the required attribute.:read-only / :read-write – Selects elements based on a combination of readonly and disabled attributes.Text-related pseudo class selectors / elements::first-letter – Selects the first letter of the text in the element.::first-line – Selects the first line of text in the element.Relational pseudo class selectors:not() – Removes elements from an existing matched set that match the selector inside the parameter of :not(). So for example, all divs except those with a class of “music” = div:not(.music). The spec says that :not selectors cannot be nested, but they can be chained. Some browsers (Firefox) also support comma-separated selectors as the selector parameter, although chaining them would be a far safer bet. Also useful in conjunction with attribute selectors, e.g. input:not([disabled]).:empty – Selects elements which contain no text and no child elements. Like: <p></p>Position/Number-based pseudo class selectors:first-child – Selects the first element within a parent.:last-child – Selects the last element within a parent.:nth-child() – Selects elements based on a simple provided algebraic expression (e.g. “2n” or “4n-1”). Has the ability to do things like select even/odd elements, “every third”, “the first five”, and things like that. Covered in more detail here with a tester tool.:nth-of-type() – Works like :nth-child, but used in places where the elements at the same level are of different types. Like if inside a div you had a number of paragraphs and a number of images. You wanted to select all the odd images. :nth-child won’t work there, you’d use div img:nth-of-type(odd). Particularly useful when working with definition lists and their alternating <dt> and <dd> elements.:first-of-type – Selects the first element of this type within any parent. So if you have two divs, each had within it a paragraph, image, paragraph, image. Then div img:first-of-type would select the first image inside the first div and the first image inside the second div.:last-of-type – Same as above, only would select the last image inside the first div and the last image inside the second div.:nth-last-of-type() – Works like :nth-of-type, but it counts up from the bottom instead of the top.:nth-last-child() – Works like :nth-child, but it counts up from the bottom instead of the top.:only-of-type – Selects only if the element is the only one of its kind.:root – Selects the element that is at the root of the document. Almost certainly will select the <html> element, unless you are specifically working in some weird environment that somehow also allows CSS. Perhaps XML.References and further readPseudo-classesA CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s).

Know The Advantages Of Responsive Web Design,https://medium.com/@support_60506/know-the-advantages-of-responsive-web-design-2efd71c7ba20?source=tag_archive---------59-----------------------,"Web Design,Web Design Company,Web Development,Responsive Design,Website","There are so many interesting advantages that you will be able to benefit from as long as you decide to invest in responsive website design. When it comes to proper web design, it would be recommended that you outsource your needs to experienced professionals.A responsive website should be like this……..One of the many benefits associated with having your site designed by the right web design experts is the fact that the final result will be even better than you are expecting it to be. Even though you might believe that just anyone can design a website, you should know that this is not really the case. Yes, there are all sorts of platforms that will offer you access to a variety of tools. However, you can’t expect to get the same outcome as actual professional web designers.Now, when it comes to the many advantages that you will benefit from when you opt for responsive web design, the major one would be the fact that your traffic will increase. This is a direct consequence of ensuring that your pages load faster and adjust to the screen on which they are accessed. Let’s break it down. When designing a website, there are countless aspects that you need to pay attention to. Just how fast a page loads will directly influence a visitor to stay longer or just give up and move on to another website.When you have too many elements and deal with other issues that prevent your website to respond quickly enough to what your visitors need, you will lose them quicker than you think. When you have someone browse your website, they will take a look at the content and click on various buttons available. Maybe they are looking for a specific product or would like to check out an entire category of products that you have in stock. If they need to wait for ages before every page load, you can’t expect your website visitors to stick around.At the same time, it is a known fact that a large part of visitors are actually mobile users. They access sites using their smartphones or tablets. If your website design does not allow it to adjust to the screen on which it is accessed, it will not leave a good impression. Seeing as there are so many websites out there that are already designed to look great on all devices, consumers do not have the patience to deal with a site that doesn’t do this. They will look for another similar site to yours.Another important advantage that you will be able to benefit from when you don’t have two websites, but just make sure that the one you currently own and manage is responsive would be the fact that you don’t have to deal with too much maintenance. There are just so many factors that can influence the way a business is perceived by its target audience. The design of your website is one of them. You must ensure that you have an amazing one and that you update it constantly so that it always offers your visitors value.If your website is responsive, you don’t have to focus on two different versions of it, which directly translates into simpler site analytics. This is how you can take a closer look at how visitors have ended up here and what they do while browsing your website. It is much easier to keep track of their activity and behaviour this way. What you should remember is that a great website can only be designed by talented professional web designers & developers. No matter how many tutorials you watch, you will not be able to achieve the same results. To offer your business a real chance at making a mark, you have to outsource your web design needs.The right professionals will do much more than build your website. They will talk to you about your business, about your goals, about your expectations and will put all that information into their concept. While working on their design, they will come up with a strategy that will convince visitors to stay here longer and turn into paying customers. Your new site will be beautiful and will offer your target audience a great user experience. Before hiring anyone to help you in this matter, make sure that you do a bit of research and read some reviews.Are you curious regarding any additional advantages associated with proper web design?

Seperti halnya kisah Asmara Cinta, Ada kalanya suka dan Duka pun juga. Lewat sebuah proses perjalanan hiduplah seseorang bisa belajar dan di paksa untuk memahami tentang apa tugas hidup ini. Begitu pula dengan KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH,merupakan sosok yang dikenal Masyarakat dengan Julukan Sang Raja Pesugihan dan Maha Pengasihan. Latar belakang keahlian beliau dalam ilmu pengasihan ini bermula dari inspirasi sosok kakek beliau yang dulunya sangat disegani di kalangan masyarakat beliau tinggal.Sosok Kakek yang di masa hidupnya selalu mengabdikan dirinya untuk setiap orang yang membutuhkan pertolongannya. Seperti mengobati orang kesurupan, gangguan makhluk halus, kena teluh dan berbagai gangguan gaib lainnya.KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH merupakan pribadi pendiam yang sukanya menyendiri dan bertirakat atau Riyadhoh (Puasa & jarang tidur di malam hari). Hobi beliau adalah mengkoleksi benda pusaka bertuah yang beliau tarik dari alam ghaib,banyak sekali jenis pusaka dan mustika berkhodam yang beliau koleksi. Seperti: Keris Omyang Jimbe, Keris Semar Piningit, Keris Naga Blorong, Mustika Merah Delima, Kristal Mani Gajah, dan Masih banyak lainnya. Kelahiran tahun 1978 di Jawa Timur,KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEHterlahir dan diberi nama RADEN SHOLEH..Beliau dilahirkan dari golongan keluarga yang tingkat religiusnya tinggi, namun kondisi ekonomi keluarga beliau pas-pasan. Atas berkah kepas-pasan ekonomi tersebut, KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH malah tambah semangat untuk menimba ilmu dari guru satu ke guru lainnya.Pernah Nyantri di Pondok PesantrenBerbekal bimbingan dari kedua orang tua, beliau di Pondokkan di pesantren. 7 Tahun lamanya KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH pernah nyantri di salah satu Pondok pesantren tertua di Kota Wali Demak. Selama nyantri di sana, beliau dikenal sebagai santri yang tak pernah letih mengaji dan mengabdi ke Bapak Kyai. Apapun arahan Sang Kyai, tanpa pikir panjang pasti beliau lakukan. Jika waktu libur tiba maka waktu itu beliau gunakan untuk tabarukan dan mengaji di Pesantren lain, seperti Pondok Pesantren Kediri dan Jombang.Mengembara Mencari Sejatining GuruSetelah diukur akan kemampuan beliau sudah cukup oleh Sang Kyai, beliau diberikan wasiat berupa pesan, yang mana beliau di suruh untuk Tirakat Lakon atau Olah Batin Mengembara mencari Sejatining Guru. Dari Makam ke Makam beliau lalui dengan Ikhlas berharap hanya mencari Ridho Alloh Sang Maha Penguasa alam semesta.Dalam perjalanan KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH tanpa membawa bekal Apapun (uang sepeserpun tidak punya) Hanya bermodal nekad dan Yakin Kalau Tuhan itu tidak tidur dan Maha Tahu akan kebutuhannya. Selama kurang lebih 3 tahun lamanya beliau mengembara dan disaat beliau Semedi di Makam / Petilasan Simbah Joko Tarub di Di Desa Tarub Kecamatan Tawangharjo Kabupaten Grobogan, tepatnya di malam jum’at kliwon bulan Suro, KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH sengaja Bersemedi dengan maksud Nyadong Pangaweruh marang Seng Kuoso, minta arahan dan jawaban akan siapa sejatinya Guru sejati ingsun.Alhasil, Beliau KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH diberikan Pangaweruh berupa jawaban dari pertanyaan yang diajukannya itu. Sadar tidak sadar beliau KYAI HASAN NUR AMIN oleh sosok Simbah berjenggot Panjang dan berjubah putih. Simbah tersebut berkata :“Sepiro duwurmu ngudi kawruh, sepiro jeromu ngangsu ngilmu, sepiro akehe guru ngajimu tembe mburine mung arep ketemu marang sejatine awake dewe. Sopo sing wus biso nemoake sedulur batine kakang kawah adi ari2 papat kiblat lima pancer, sejatine wus nemu guru sejatine.

Kabeh mau artine isoo nggulowentah sekabehane napsu sing ono jiwo lan rogone awake dewe.Yen wus iso, banjur nemu guru kang sejati, sejatine guru, yoiku awake dewe-dewe”.Pernah Singgah di Dunia GhaibSetelah KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH mendapatkan jawaban atas Sejatineng Guru, Beliau membuka mata dan menghirup udara sebentar. Tak lama kemudian beliau melanjutkan semedinya tersebut,kembali KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH di datangi oleh sosok Simbah Sepuh tadi (berjenggot panjang dan berbaju serba putih). Simbah sepuh tersebut berkata: Le…, awakmu gak usah wedi karo aku. Lalu KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH bertanya, Jenengan niku sinten….? Jawab Simbah, Aku iki Le, sing Jogo lan tugasku ngarahno awakmu…, Aku Joko Tarub, Reneo Melu aku! Beliau KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEHtersahut entah kemana, tiba — tiba beliau telah sampai di pegunungan berkawah yang tak pernah beliau kenal sebelumnya dan terbesit di hati beliau bergumam “Sebenere aku iki neng ngendi ?” tanpa jeda lama simbah Joko Tarub tersebut menjawab “iki awakmu neng alame bongso ngoib Le…, rak usah wedi, iki kabeh koncone dewe”.Asal Mula Panggilan KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH banyak mengalami pengalaman-pengalaman Gaib di saat berada di petilasan Simbah Joko Tarub. Salah satu pengalaman mistisnya yaitu saat bersemedi tiba-tiba ada suara gaib yang memanggilnya dengan sebutan “KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH”. Awalnya beliau kurang begitu menghiraukan akan panggilan tersebut, karena dalam benak beliau; mungkin ini hanyalah suara lewat saja. Namun, lama-lama suara itu begitu jelas terdengar. Anehnya tidak ada seorang pun di situ kecuali dirinya.Saat itulah ia di datangi sosok yang sama yang pernah menemuinya di Petilasan Simbah Joko Tarub Di Desa Sani Kabupaten Pati — Jawa Tengah. Dari pertemuan itu,KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH pun mendapat banyak wejangan tentang ilmu Pesugihan, ilmu batin, meraga sukma, ilmu hakikat, dan pemahaman tentang pusaka-pusaka mistis dan mustika yang ada di alam gaib.Semenjak bertemu dan belajar kepada sosok gaib Simbah Joko Tarub itu,KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH mulai memperlihatkan peningkatan kewaskitaannya. Disaat itu Beliau menemui, sosok gaib lain lagi menyendiri di bawah pohon dekat makam Joko Tarub, sosok gaib tersebut didekati KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH dan beliau bertanya:Sampean niku sinten? Kok Piyambaan ten Mriki…, sosok gaib tersebut menjawab, kulo bingung soale ibu kulo mpun tilar lan kulo mangkeh derek sinten? Lanjut KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH Berkata: awakmu entok sedih lan getuni lakonmu.Namun siji seng perlu mbok ngerteni, sedih yow sedih namun ojo Nyedihi terus terusan. Mulai sejak itulah gelar “KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH” melekat erat dengannya. Karena kemampuannya dalam memberi petunjuk dan arahan.Kelebihan yang tak kalah istimewanya,KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEHjuga mampu memanggil dan mengisi Mustika hasil tarikan Gaib Beliau dan pusaka peninggalan leluhur dengan khodam putih yang berderajat tinggi di alamnya. Akan tetapi tidak semua orang mempunyai keahlian seperti KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH, dan beliau menuturkan semua ini bukan karena saya pintar melainkan karena Kuasa Sang Pencipta Alam Semesta ini Allah SWT.Aktivitas KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH Saat iniSebagai seorang yang mempunyai kelebihan di bidang ilmu Pesugihan, Pengasihan dan Ilmu Hikmah,, keseharian KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEHdipenuhi dengan kegiatan untuk membantu masyarakat di Pondok Supranatural Inti Tunggal dan di berbagai tempat di Indonesia.Pondok Supranatural Inti Tunggal adalah tempat bertemu antara Guru dan Murid, antara KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH dengan Klien Beliau..

Begitu pula dengan KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH,merupakan sosok yang dikenal Masyarakat dengan Julukan Sang Raja Pesugihan dan Maha Pengasihan. Latar belakang keahlian beliau dalam ilmu pengasihan ini bermula dari inspirasi sosok kakek beliau yang dulunya sangat disegani di kalangan masyarakat beliau tinggal.Sosok Kakek yang di masa hidupnya selalu mengabdikan dirinya untuk setiap orang yang membutuhkan pertolongannya. Seperti mengobati orang kesurupan, gangguan makhluk halus, kena teluh dan berbagai gangguan gaib lainnya.KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH merupakan pribadi pendiam yang sukanya menyendiri dan bertirakat atau Riyadhoh (Puasa & jarang tidur di malam hari). Hobi beliau adalah mengkoleksi benda pusaka bertuah yang beliau tarik dari alam ghaib,banyak sekali jenis pusaka dan mustika berkhodam yang beliau koleksi. Seperti: Keris Omyang Jimbe, Keris Semar Piningit, Keris Naga Blorong, Mustika Merah Delima, Kristal Mani Gajah, dan Masih banyak lainnya. Kelahiran tahun 1978 di Jawa Timur,KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEHterlahir dan diberi nama RADEN SHOLEH..Beliau dilahirkan dari golongan keluarga yang tingkat religiusnya tinggi, namun kondisi ekonomi keluarga beliau pas-pasan. Atas berkah kepas-pasan ekonomi tersebut, KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH malah tambah semangat untuk menimba ilmu dari guru satu ke guru lainnya.Pernah Nyantri di Pondok PesantrenBerbekal bimbingan dari kedua orang tua, beliau di Pondokkan di pesantren. 7 Tahun lamanya KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH pernah nyantri di salah satu Pondok pesantren tertua di Kota Wali Demak. Selama nyantri di sana, beliau dikenal sebagai santri yang tak pernah letih mengaji dan mengabdi ke Bapak Kyai. Apapun arahan Sang Kyai, tanpa pikir panjang pasti beliau lakukan. Jika waktu libur tiba maka waktu itu beliau gunakan untuk tabarukan dan mengaji di Pesantren lain, seperti Pondok Pesantren Kediri dan Jombang.Mengembara Mencari Sejatining GuruSetelah diukur akan kemampuan beliau sudah cukup oleh Sang Kyai, beliau diberikan wasiat berupa pesan, yang mana beliau di suruh untuk Tirakat Lakon atau Olah Batin Mengembara mencari Sejatining Guru. Dari Makam ke Makam beliau lalui dengan Ikhlas berharap hanya mencari Ridho Alloh Sang Maha Penguasa alam semesta.Dalam perjalanan KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH tanpa membawa bekal Apapun (uang sepeserpun tidak punya) Hanya bermodal nekad dan Yakin Kalau Tuhan itu tidak tidur dan Maha Tahu akan kebutuhannya. Selama kurang lebih 3 tahun lamanya beliau mengembara dan disaat beliau Semedi di Makam / Petilasan Simbah Joko Tarub di Di Desa Tarub Kecamatan Tawangharjo Kabupaten Grobogan, tepatnya di malam jum’at kliwon bulan Suro, KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH sengaja Bersemedi dengan maksud Nyadong Pangaweruh marang Seng Kuoso, minta arahan dan jawaban akan siapa sejatinya Guru sejati ingsun.Alhasil, Beliau KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH diberikan Pangaweruh berupa jawaban dari pertanyaan yang diajukannya itu. Sadar tidak sadar beliau KYAI HASAN NUR AMIN oleh sosok Simbah berjenggot Panjang dan berjubah putih. Simbah tersebut berkata :“Sepiro duwurmu ngudi kawruh, sepiro jeromu ngangsu ngilmu, sepiro akehe guru ngajimu tembe mburine mung arep ketemu marang sejatine awake dewe. Sopo sing wus biso nemoake sedulur batine kakang kawah adi ari2 papat kiblat lima pancer, sejatine wus nemu guru sejatine.

Kabeh mau artine isoo nggulowentah sekabehane napsu sing ono jiwo lan rogone awake dewe.Yen wus iso, banjur nemu guru kang sejati, sejatine guru, yoiku awake dewe-dewe”.Pernah Singgah di Dunia GhaibSetelah KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH mendapatkan jawaban atas Sejatineng Guru, Beliau membuka mata dan menghirup udara sebentar. Tak lama kemudian beliau melanjutkan semedinya tersebut,kembali KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH di datangi oleh sosok Simbah Sepuh tadi (berjenggot panjang dan berbaju serba putih). Simbah sepuh tersebut berkata: Le…, awakmu gak usah wedi karo aku. Lalu KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH bertanya, Jenengan niku sinten….? Jawab Simbah, Aku iki Le, sing Jogo lan tugasku ngarahno awakmu…, Aku Joko Tarub, Reneo Melu aku! Beliau KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEHtersahut entah kemana, tiba — tiba beliau telah sampai di pegunungan berkawah yang tak pernah beliau kenal sebelumnya dan terbesit di hati beliau bergumam “Sebenere aku iki neng ngendi ?” tanpa jeda lama simbah Joko Tarub tersebut menjawab “iki awakmu neng alame bongso ngoib Le…, rak usah wedi, iki kabeh koncone dewe”.Asal Mula Panggilan KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH banyak mengalami pengalaman-pengalaman Gaib di saat berada di petilasan Simbah Joko Tarub. Salah satu pengalaman mistisnya yaitu saat bersemedi tiba-tiba ada suara gaib yang memanggilnya dengan sebutan “KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH”. Awalnya beliau kurang begitu menghiraukan akan panggilan tersebut, karena dalam benak beliau; mungkin ini hanyalah suara lewat saja. Namun, lama-lama suara itu begitu jelas terdengar. Anehnya tidak ada seorang pun di situ kecuali dirinya.Saat itulah ia di datangi sosok yang sama yang pernah menemuinya di Petilasan Simbah Joko Tarub Di Desa Sani Kabupaten Pati — Jawa Tengah. Dari pertemuan itu,KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH pun mendapat banyak wejangan tentang ilmu Pesugihan, ilmu batin, meraga sukma, ilmu hakikat, dan pemahaman tentang pusaka-pusaka mistis dan mustika yang ada di alam gaib.Semenjak bertemu dan belajar kepada sosok gaib Simbah Joko Tarub itu,KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH mulai memperlihatkan peningkatan kewaskitaannya. Disaat itu Beliau menemui, sosok gaib lain lagi menyendiri di bawah pohon dekat makam Joko Tarub, sosok gaib tersebut didekati KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH dan beliau bertanya:Sampean niku sinten? Kok Piyambaan ten Mriki…, sosok gaib tersebut menjawab, kulo bingung soale ibu kulo mpun tilar lan kulo mangkeh derek sinten? Lanjut KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH Berkata: awakmu entok sedih lan getuni lakonmu.Namun siji seng perlu mbok ngerteni, sedih yow sedih namun ojo Nyedihi terus terusan.

Karena kemampuannya dalam memberi petunjuk dan arahan.Kelebihan yang tak kalah istimewanya,KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEHjuga mampu memanggil dan mengisi Mustika hasil tarikan Gaib Beliau dan pusaka peninggalan leluhur dengan khodam putih yang berderajat tinggi di alamnya. Akan tetapi tidak semua orang mempunyai keahlian seperti KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH, dan beliau menuturkan semua ini bukan karena saya pintar melainkan karena Kuasa Sang Pencipta Alam Semesta ini Allah SWT.Aktivitas KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH Saat iniSebagai seorang yang mempunyai kelebihan di bidang ilmu Pesugihan, Pengasihan dan Ilmu Hikmah,, keseharian KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEHdipenuhi dengan kegiatan untuk membantu masyarakat di Pondok Supranatural Inti Tunggal dan di berbagai tempat di Indonesia.Pondok Supranatural Inti Tunggal adalah tempat bertemu antara Guru dan Murid, antara KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH dengan Klien Beliau..

It might be a system-wide setting exposed by the Operating System, or a setting controlled by the User-Agent.prefers-color-scheme CSS media feature works with the following values:no-preference: This indicates that the user has made no preference known to the system.light: This indicates that the user has notified the system that they prefer a page that has a light theme.dark: This indicates that the user has notified the system that they prefer a page that has a dark theme.As the dark mode is reported through a media query, you can easily check if the current browser supports dark mode by checking if the media query prefers-color-scheme matches at all. You can optionally check if the browser supports it using Javascript.if (window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme)').media === 'not all') {  console.log('Browser doesn't support dark mode');}Using custom properties (–*): CSS variables for themingTo define a variable, you can use the --variable-name: value format.:root {  --page-background: #fff;  --page-title: #333;  --page-text: #333;}@media screen and (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {  :root {    --page-background: #333;    --page-title: #fff;    --page-text: #fff;  }}body {  background: var(--page-background);  color: var(--page-text);}h1 {  color: var(--page-title);}p {  color: var(--page-text);}Not all browsers support CSS variables. But with a little help of JavaScript you can make it work. Just make a class to apply on body and override styles in any element within that body you want to change and toggle that one class on body.body[theme=""dark""] {  background: #333;  color: #fff;}You may also use currentColor to save you some CSS. Basically you should change the main styles on HTML/body and that should be enough for most simple cases if you just want to invert colors.Dark mode for SVGYou can use prefers-color-scheme media feature and CSS variables to style colors inside of SVG, just like your other elements.<svg width=""100"" height=""100"" xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"">  <style>    circle {      fill: white;      stroke: black;      stroke-width: 3px;    }    @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {      circle {        fill: black;        stroke: yellow;      }    }  </style>  <circle cx=""50"" cy=""50"" r=""47""/></svg>Are there any benefits of using dark mode?It saves energy, mainly if the device uses an OLED or AMOLED screen. Doesn’t strain your eyes too much at night. But keep in mind that dark mode is not always better for eye strain. In bright light conditions, the text appears washed out, increasing eye fatigue.Written byRonalds VilcinsI drink a lot of tea and build beautiful websites.

Seperti halnya kisah Asmara Cinta, Ada kalanya suka dan Duka pun juga. Lewat sebuah proses perjalanan hiduplah seseorang bisa belajar dan di paksa untuk memahami tentang apa tugas hidup ini. Begitu pula dengan KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH,merupakan sosok yang dikenal Masyarakat dengan Julukan Sang Raja Pesugihan dan Maha Pengasihan. Latar belakang keahlian beliau dalam ilmu pengasihan ini bermula dari inspirasi sosok kakek beliau yang dulunya sangat disegani di kalangan masyarakat beliau tinggal.Sosok Kakek yang di masa hidupnya selalu mengabdikan dirinya untuk setiap orang yang membutuhkan pertolongannya. Seperti mengobati orang kesurupan, gangguan makhluk halus, kena teluh dan berbagai gangguan gaib lainnya.KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH merupakan pribadi pendiam yang sukanya menyendiri dan bertirakat atau Riyadhoh (Puasa & jarang tidur di malam hari). Hobi beliau adalah mengkoleksi benda pusaka bertuah yang beliau tarik dari alam ghaib,banyak sekali jenis pusaka dan mustika berkhodam yang beliau koleksi. Seperti: Keris Omyang Jimbe, Keris Semar Piningit, Keris Naga Blorong, Mustika Merah Delima, Kristal Mani Gajah, dan Masih banyak lainnya. Kelahiran tahun 1978 di Jawa Timur,KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEHterlahir dan diberi nama RADEN SHOLEH..Beliau dilahirkan dari golongan keluarga yang tingkat religiusnya tinggi, namun kondisi ekonomi keluarga beliau pas-pasan. Atas berkah kepas-pasan ekonomi tersebut, KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH malah tambah semangat untuk menimba ilmu dari guru satu ke guru lainnya.Pernah Nyantri di Pondok PesantrenBerbekal bimbingan dari kedua orang tua, beliau di Pondokkan di pesantren. 7 Tahun lamanya KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH pernah nyantri di salah satu Pondok pesantren tertua di Kota Wali Demak. Selama nyantri di sana, beliau dikenal sebagai santri yang tak pernah letih mengaji dan mengabdi ke Bapak Kyai. Apapun arahan Sang Kyai, tanpa pikir panjang pasti beliau lakukan. Jika waktu libur tiba maka waktu itu beliau gunakan untuk tabarukan dan mengaji di Pesantren lain, seperti Pondok Pesantren Kediri dan Jombang.Mengembara Mencari Sejatining GuruSetelah diukur akan kemampuan beliau sudah cukup oleh Sang Kyai, beliau diberikan wasiat berupa pesan, yang mana beliau di suruh untuk Tirakat Lakon atau Olah Batin Mengembara mencari Sejatining Guru. Dari Makam ke Makam beliau lalui dengan Ikhlas berharap hanya mencari Ridho Alloh Sang Maha Penguasa alam semesta.Dalam perjalanan KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH tanpa membawa bekal Apapun (uang sepeserpun tidak punya) Hanya bermodal nekad dan Yakin Kalau Tuhan itu tidak tidur dan Maha Tahu akan kebutuhannya. Selama kurang lebih 3 tahun lamanya beliau mengembara dan disaat beliau Semedi di Makam / Petilasan Simbah Joko Tarub di Di Desa Tarub Kecamatan Tawangharjo Kabupaten Grobogan, tepatnya di malam jum’at kliwon bulan Suro, KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH sengaja Bersemedi dengan maksud Nyadong Pangaweruh marang Seng Kuoso, minta arahan dan jawaban akan siapa sejatinya Guru sejati ingsun.Alhasil, Beliau KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH diberikan Pangaweruh berupa jawaban dari pertanyaan yang diajukannya itu. Sadar tidak sadar beliau KYAI HASAN NUR AMIN oleh sosok Simbah berjenggot Panjang dan berjubah putih. Simbah tersebut berkata :“Sepiro duwurmu ngudi kawruh, sepiro jeromu ngangsu ngilmu, sepiro akehe guru ngajimu tembe mburine mung arep ketemu marang sejatine awake dewe. Sopo sing wus biso nemoake sedulur batine kakang kawah adi ari2 papat kiblat lima pancer, sejatine wus nemu guru sejatine. Koyo epos bimo nggoleki kayu gung susuhing angin,gigireng panglu (bibir globe), galihing kangkung, watesane langit jaladri utawa nggoleki dlamakane kuntul mabur. Utowo goleki papat napsu sing ngiring jiwo rogo siro yoiku Sufiah (putih), Mutmainah (kuning), ALuamah (abang) lan Amarah (ireng). Kabeh mau artine isoo nggulowentah sekabehane napsu sing ono jiwo lan rogone awake dewe.Yen wus iso, banjur nemu guru kang sejati, sejatine guru, yoiku awake dewe-dewe”.Pernah Singgah di Dunia GhaibSetelah KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH mendapatkan jawaban atas Sejatineng Guru, Beliau membuka mata dan menghirup udara sebentar. Tak lama kemudian beliau melanjutkan semedinya tersebut,kembali KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH di datangi oleh sosok Simbah Sepuh tadi (berjenggot panjang dan berbaju serba putih). Simbah sepuh tersebut berkata: Le…, awakmu gak usah wedi karo aku. Lalu KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH bertanya, Jenengan niku sinten….? Jawab Simbah, Aku iki Le, sing Jogo lan tugasku ngarahno awakmu…, Aku Joko Tarub, Reneo Melu aku! Beliau KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEHtersahut entah kemana, tiba — tiba beliau telah sampai di pegunungan berkawah yang tak pernah beliau kenal sebelumnya dan terbesit di hati beliau bergumam “Sebenere aku iki neng ngendi ?” tanpa jeda lama simbah Joko Tarub tersebut menjawab “iki awakmu neng alame bongso ngoib Le…, rak usah wedi, iki kabeh koncone dewe”.Asal Mula Panggilan KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH banyak mengalami pengalaman-pengalaman Gaib di saat berada di petilasan Simbah Joko Tarub. Salah satu pengalaman mistisnya yaitu saat bersemedi tiba-tiba ada suara gaib yang memanggilnya dengan sebutan “KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH”. Awalnya beliau kurang begitu menghiraukan akan panggilan tersebut, karena dalam benak beliau; mungkin ini hanyalah suara lewat saja. Namun, lama-lama suara itu begitu jelas terdengar. Anehnya tidak ada seorang pun di situ kecuali dirinya.Saat itulah ia di datangi sosok yang sama yang pernah menemuinya di Petilasan Simbah Joko Tarub Di Desa Sani Kabupaten Pati — Jawa Tengah. Dari pertemuan itu,KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH pun mendapat banyak wejangan tentang ilmu Pesugihan, ilmu batin, meraga sukma, ilmu hakikat, dan pemahaman tentang pusaka-pusaka mistis dan mustika yang ada di alam gaib.Semenjak bertemu dan belajar kepada sosok gaib Simbah Joko Tarub itu,KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH mulai memperlihatkan peningkatan kewaskitaannya. Disaat itu Beliau menemui, sosok gaib lain lagi menyendiri di bawah pohon dekat makam Joko Tarub, sosok gaib tersebut didekati KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH dan beliau bertanya:Sampean niku sinten? Kok Piyambaan ten Mriki…, sosok gaib tersebut menjawab, kulo bingung soale ibu kulo mpun tilar lan kulo mangkeh derek sinten? Lanjut KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH Berkata: awakmu entok sedih lan getuni lakonmu.Namun siji seng perlu mbok ngerteni, sedih yow sedih namun ojo Nyedihi terus terusan. Mulai sejak itulah gelar “KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH” melekat erat dengannya. Karena kemampuannya dalam memberi petunjuk dan arahan.Kelebihan yang tak kalah istimewanya,KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEHjuga mampu memanggil dan mengisi Mustika hasil tarikan Gaib Beliau dan pusaka peninggalan leluhur dengan khodam putih yang berderajat tinggi di alamnya. Akan tetapi tidak semua orang mempunyai keahlian seperti KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH, dan beliau menuturkan semua ini bukan karena saya pintar melainkan karena Kuasa Sang Pencipta Alam Semesta ini Allah SWT.Aktivitas KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH Saat iniSebagai seorang yang mempunyai kelebihan di bidang ilmu Pesugihan, Pengasihan dan Ilmu Hikmah,, keseharian KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEHdipenuhi dengan kegiatan untuk membantu masyarakat di Pondok Supranatural Inti Tunggal dan di berbagai tempat di Indonesia.Pondok Supranatural Inti Tunggal adalah tempat bertemu antara Guru dan Murid, antara KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH dengan Klien Beliau.. Beliau juga sering mendapat undangan khusus untuk memimpin ritual dan ruwatan di berbagai tempat. Bagi beliau, semulia-mulianya manusia adalah manusia yang bisa bermanfaat bagi manusia lainnya. Oleh karena itu, tak ada kata lelah dan letih demi menolong siapapun yang membutuhkan bantuan beliau.KYAI RADEN ABDUL SHOLEH dikenal sebagai Sang Pakar Guru Pesugihan, Pengasihan Dan Ilmu Pelet.

Hire Freelancer Team— What to know before you start an app or web development project | Part 2,https://medium.com/@linus.kho/you-have-an-app-idea-what-to-know-before-you-start-an-app-or-web-development-project-part-2-45a75374d498?source=tag_archive---------74-----------------------,"App Development,Web Development,Software Development,Singapore,Freelancers","Well, now we get into the action part — where to recruit the DevOps team?The Freelancer MarketplaceThe most common and widely available place is freelance marketplace sites. A simple search on the internet will surface many freelance sites. They are generally a great place to look non-core services to get you started for UI/UX services like getting the idea drawn into the design, or get legal write-up.However, But do stay away from software development work. Freelance market sites are filled with tons of small groups. As soon as you create a project with a budget amount in the freelance site. You will get excited by these:Many bids, many choicesReviews are all excellentBids are all cheap pricingINPUTMany choices are an illusion. Many and most groups have the same setup and mode of operation (more of this later). I would not be surprise for every group they would have like multiple accounts and names.Excellent review is not the real picture. They get all the excellent reviews by pushing very hard for good reviews each time. There is a whole market of review exchange or buying once you get deeper into the industry.Cheap pricing is fishing for a bite. Once a bite happens, you will find that the same price will buy you must less items than the initially bidding proposal. You will be managed very well by these experts in your requirements and expectation.PROCESSOn the positive note, freelance marketplace sites do have built-in control for acceptance of deliverables before payment is disbursed. Normally, you split the payment into milestones. That way on each milestone delivery is met, thus an acceptance on deliverable, hence payment approved.This mechanism to mediate is an important safeguard for us the client by making it a controlled risk in potential money loss. More so the greater risk is a waste of time.However, the mode of operation in freelance groups are very much short term basis. They want to get the job delivered and get paid with precision to requirements set in the agreement. This probably can work for an MVP project or an established app that requires a small fix.OUTPUTBeing a start-up project means there is a large margin of changes, re-design, re-direction. A typical start takes between 1 to 2 years to stabilize the actual value proposition. It is in the start-up project best interest to have a long term set up with the DevOps team to realize the vision. The freelance marketplace is not the place to look for long term partners.If you are not convinced, do this. Submit a small project with an amount you willing to lose. Do this as an evaluation of the team.Link to other partsPart 1: You have an App ideaPart 2: Hire Freelancer TeamPart 3: Engage Software CompanyPart 4: Join Dev Social GroupPart 5: Startup DevOps Analysis & StrategySingaporeCasualess JBS (community@casualess.com) a Singapore DevOps teamWritten byLinus KhoInput -> Process -> Output | I make software simpleFollow2 2 2 App DevelopmentWeb DevelopmentSoftware DevelopmentSingaporeFreelancersMore from Linus KhoFollowInput -> Process -> Output | I make software simpleMore From MediumWhat I Learned From Writing 39,000 Orders for TextbrokerAnne Varvel in The StartupFalling Into Freelancing Will Leave You BrokeStella Inabo in The StartupQuestions About FreelancingJonica Bradley in High XpectationsHow to be a journalist (at least according to me)Rosie SpinksSelf-Employed?

Skate the Bay: Building a Virtual Marathon,https://medium.com/@shredinger/skate-the-bay-building-a-virtual-marathon-38d1abe0e2da?source=tag_archive---------75-----------------------,"JavaScript,Roller Derby,Marathon,Gamification,Web Development","When the pandemic started, roller derby practice stopped. As part of the marketing team for Rohnert Park’s Resurrection Roller Derby, I got to help cancel all of our games for the season. As with most leagues, this left us in a rough spot in keeping engagement with both fans and members. It also left a lot of people in need of activities, with their hobby and social activities on hold.So, we came up with the idea of a virtual marathon. Not a new idea, but we hadn’t seen it done too much with skating. We thought it would be extra engaging to have a geographic element. We wanted something reasonable doable by participants, engaging and easy to manage.Eventually we settled on ‘Skate the Bay’, the equivalent of circling around the San Francisco Bay and San Pablo Bay. That came out to 155 miles, which we thought seemed a bit much. The result was three separate routes, inspired by half and full marathons we’ve seen at events. ‘Mini’, which is going across the Golden Gate Bridge for new skaters; ‘Bridging’, a route crossing all three Bay Area bridges at 42 miles, and ‘Full Bay’ at 155.Instead of charging people, we encouraged participants to donate to their local food bank. Our benefit comes from marketing and ongoing connections with the community.This also required a way to track miles, something beyond sharing in Facebook groups.The AppThe idea for this marathon started at the end of April, and we wanted to launch in May. That meant I had a limited amount of time. And, given no team, I wanted something that was simple enough to be unlikely to break. What follows is my take on the simplest way to solve what we wanted. The necessities:Allow users to sign up without admin interventionAllow users to enter their distances, show it to them in a nice wayEngage users with ongoing achievementsI built this with a React/Node/Express/MongoDB stack for a few reasons. First, I like NoSQL when I don’t know the shape of the data, this being a good example of that. React/Node/Express is kind of an obvious choice for me, if there isn’t a good reason to do otherwise I consider this default. This also is the stack I used for a league management app that I had been developing, which already had a number of relevant features, so I started by copying it.Repo: https://github.com/shredinger137/marathonSignupThe flow here starts with signing up. We require an email address and that’s it. To prevent myself from having to do more work, I opted to use a system of unique URL’s rather than username/password systems. Not taking passwords or storing credential cookies also reduces liability. It’s not the most secure option, necessarily, but since there’s no personal data I decided this would work for us:app.get(""/signup"", function (req, res)   {     res.header(""Access-Control-Allow-Origin"", ""*"");             res.setHeader(""Content-Type"", ""text/plain"");     if (req && req.query && req.query.email) {                var userEmail = req.query.email;         var userDisplayName = req.query.name;         var marathonSelection = req.query.marathon;         var id = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);                           checkUserData(id, userEmail).then(checkResult => {                         if (checkResult == true) {                               addNewUserToDatabase(userEmail, userDisplayName, marathonSelection, id);                var content = createWelcomeEmail(id);                                sendEmailToUser(userEmail, ""Welcome to Skate the Bay"", content);                res.send(id);            }            else {                res.send(""oop"");            }        })    }});That’s the entirety of signups, and an example of me trying to keep things simple throughout the app. At this point ‘id’ has been generated, and the URL we use just pulls id as an argument. The ‘content’ in the welcome email includes that link, so as long as people save the email they can get back.Unfortunately, my first problem came up using nodemailer to send the emails. Spam filters were catching a lot of emails, and I learned two things. First, I learned that spam filtered emails are going to be lost for good among a large group of people. Second, I learned that using nodemailer without specifying your ‘to’ address correctly makes it spam. I had thought it wasn’t important because I was logging into a Gmail account to send stuff, but that was wrong. Things worked better after that was fixed.TrackingUsers track distance in whatever way they want, then enter them on our app along with a date. Feedback is both numerical and via a bar, made up of two divs overlapping, with state including ‘totalDistance’ to set width.AchievementsThis component, to me, is the most important part. I play a lot of video games. Lately I’ve played a lot of Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition with my wife. It’s not that the game has a lot of new mechanics to explore. It’s that they have an achievement you get by winning once with every civilization. And my wife needs all of the achievements.So, I took a day off work to come up with a series of achievements for each marathon. These are based on distances. We found landmarks on the map, on the route or near enough. The React side has a state, like I said, for totalDistance. It also has selected marathon. The Achievements component takes that value, goes through a JSON file that contains an object for each marathon, and displays each one that has a ‘distance’ less than or equal to the total distance the user has entered.This was a hit. People shared their latest achievements in social media posts, some of them were developed through conversation with participants and they really liked that. I think it was critical. And I’m pretty proud of the graphics.StatsSomeone on our forum asked how many people were signed up, so I made a stats page. While I had some plans for what would make good leaderboards, time didn’t allow me to do most of them. Instead, I just made a list of top totals, people who have completed the Full Bay, combined miles and total skaters.This was useful to us, and we learned that people were excited to see the total participation. It helped them feel connected to a large scale experience. We also had some people interested in the combined miles stat, to the extent that I’d like to integrate the achievements system on a community wide basis.Lessons and Next StepsIf we do this again, one thing we’ll have to think about is how to end it. This marathon started with no clear end date, which was a mistake. We also learned new features that would be useful. Community achievements, better leaderboards, better design on the frontend, active maps that show where everyone has gotten to, things like that.One big oversight was not being able to easily identify who has actually finished, which I made a hacked together API page for later. This wasn’t an issue because we decided against awards, but one of our league member who runs Flat Track Hero volunteered to provide stickers to people who finished and needed that information later.In the end, 580 people registered and participated, and we got a lot of engagement on social media. The participants, who have continued entering miles after finishing, have almost managed to circumnavigate the Earth twice. The marathon was able to run with very little work on our part, mostly bug fixes and looking up lost dashboard links.There has also been interest in the concept, with Hawaiian skaters hosting their own Island based marathon.That caused us to consider spinning off the app into something standalone, which is a current project. The new app will allow admins to sign up and host their own marathons, as well as providing us with more admin level controls to make easy changes. More on that when it’s ready.Written byCasey LewistonSoftware developer, physicist, organizational strategist, cat aficionado. Sharing roller derby management and software development work.

Writing tests will save you time.,https://medium.com/@sangilyun/writing-tests-will-save-you-time-c250a1ad5778?source=tag_archive---------76-----------------------,"Software Development,Web Development","Learned the importance of writing tests the hard way.Photo by Austin Distel on UnsplashContext — Tight deadline.What I did — Skipped planning code architecture, skipped writing test and tried to reuse one component for different places. Don’t get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with reusing components. In fact, trying to make well-designed reusable components help us to write better software. But what I ended up doing was making one generic component that’s overly complicated.How did it go and what went wrong — Because I was reusing one component in 3 different places with slight style modification, one fix here broke something there. The code got harder and harder to maintain.Adding the component in Storybook could’ve helped.Take away — Plan carefully before you write code and write tests to make sure what you just wrote works. Having tests that will tell you if something breaks will make it easier to focus on the next task, without worrying that the new code or the changes you make might break what you’ve written.Written bySangil YunFollowSoftware DevelopmentWeb DevelopmentMore from Sangil YunFollowMore From MediumHijack JavaScript Features in Your Own ObjectsAlex Ritzcovan in The StartupHeadless CMS — Integrating Gatsby with WordPressCT Solutions in The StartupDive into Docker Compose with Node.jsVitaliy LeonovJavaScript — Build your object a builder!Ron Yosef in JavaScript In Plain EnglishCreating a Simple App With React.jsEmi Katsuta in Better ProgrammingMake Your Own Lucky BreakE Val in The StartupBlazor Form Validation Mechanics OverviewBogdan Chorniy in The StartupAn Introduction to Environment Variables and How to Use ThemJim Medlock in ChinguAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

Why a Logo Designing Important for Business,https://medium.com/@mehullaloahir/why-a-logo-designing-important-for-business-a992ae1f6a8f?source=tag_archive---------78-----------------------,"Logo Design,Logo,Business Strategy,Web Development,Webdesing","Why a Logo is ImportantWe are top logo designing company in junagadh. we will render a beautiful unique, and appropriate logo that will serve you to brand your business with a memorable and high-quality print-ready graphic. We work with you utilizing your ideas or a pre-existing logo that requires a refresh. Ask us about ourdesign procedure and pricing today, and get your unique & custom logo design. We also offer digital marketing, SEO, web designing, app Development etc..When you’re considering all of the factors that go into building a business, creating a logo might not seem like a top priority.“Maybe I don’t even need a logo at all,” a little voice is whispering in the back of your mind.Don’t listen to that voice; he couldn’t be more wrong. Having a logo is an integral part of making your brand a successful one — right up there with having high-quality products and positive referrals.So, why is a logo important? Because it grabs attention, makes a strong first impression, is the foundation of your brand identity, is memorable, separates you from competition, fosters brand loyalty, and is expected by your audience.Let’s take a deeper look at all of these points below.1. It Grabs Attention:As things stand, companies have about 2 seconds to convince potential customers that their products are worth any consideration.A logo can quickly grab viewers’ attention and communicate a company’s core values in an interesting way. That short attention span — you know, the one that causes consumers to judge your business by its appearance — can work to your advantage, if you have a solid logo to speak for your company.2. It Makes a Strong First ImpressionA logo is a company’s first introduction to consumers. If designed well, it can pique the interest of the public and invite them to learn more about the company; if not, you’ve just alienated a potential customer base and basically tanked your business.This first impression is your way to immediately communicate ownership over the product(s) you sell or niche you dominate.Do you offer women’s basketballs with an enhanced grip? Is your financial advice particularly helpful for solopreneurs? Your logo introduces your company as an authority in your professional space from the get-go.3. It’s the Foundation of Your Brand IdentitySuccessful branding is about telling a story that will influence customers’ emotions — plain and simple.And, while it’s true that logo design is only a part of a company’s brand, it serves as the foundation for the entire narrative on which the brand is built.Colors, tones, fonts — all of this is determined by the story you’re trying to tell, and your logo sets the stage for this story.These elements will later translate from your logo onto all of your branding materials — letterheads, business cards, landing pages, you name it — creating a concrete, marketable brand identity.4. It’s MemorableLogos are a point of identification; they’re the symbol that customers use to recognize your brand. Ideally, you’ll want people to instantly connect the sight of your logo with the memory of what your company does — and, more importantly, how it makes them feel.Because a good logo is a visual, aesthetically pleasing element, it triggers positive recall about your brand that the name of your company alone might not.And, if we’re all being honest, some of your audience will likely forget the name of your business (don’t take it personally — it’s human nature), but they’ll immediately associate your logo with their memories of your brand.5. It Separates You From CompetitionDare to be different with your logo, because your company logo tells consumers why your business is unique. Sure, maybe there are 50 other coffee shops in your city, but yours is the only one that’s committed to sustainability, and your green, earthy logo drives that message home.A well-designed company logo can communicate everything from the company’s background (professional, relaxed, fun) to their mission (entertainment, efficiency, and innovation) through the right icon or proper font.In other words, your logo is the forum to both convey your values and show consumers why you’re not like your competitors — you’re better.6. It Fosters Brand LoyaltyAs your brand grows, your logo is going to become more familiar to a wide range of consumers, and this familiarity creates the perception that you’re trustworthy and accessible.Think about it: When you’re out shopping for workout gear and suddenly spot track pants with the Nike swoosh, you’re instantly ready to buy. Why? Because with Nike apparel, you know you’re in safe hands; Nike is a brand you trust. Trust is built on a well-designed logo, and brand loyalty is quick to follow.Once they like you, your customers are going to seek you out again and again — and your logo is the thing they’ll look for first.7. Your Audience Expects itYour logo is the first thing that your audience will look for when they see any communications from your brand. It should be front and center of all your marketing materials such as business cards, flyers, advertisements, etc.If you don’t have a logo (and one that stands out), then you are missing an opportunity to make your business stick in the minds of your audience.Lean more…Written byMehul01FollowLogo DesignLogoBusiness StrategyWeb DevelopmentWebdesingMore from Mehul01FollowMore From MediumHow to Write Deep CopyHeidi Anspaugh in The StartupHow to Write Memorable Conversational CopyAnna Klawitter in Better Marketing9 Reasons You Absolutely Have to Build Nofollow Links for SEOSandeep Mehta in HackerNoon.comImpressions matter!

And along with these domain names, there are various ways to use these domains on your account:Drafted below will help you understand the differences between these domain types.Primary DomainThis is the domain name assigned as your account’s “main” domain. It’s the domain you use to log into your account, as well as to identify your account to Namecheap support team or management. There can only be one Primary domain name at a time on a given hosting account.Parked DomainAny domain set as a “parked,” domain serves to point to the same content and website as your primary domain. This is helpful if you have one website but wish to have multiple domains point to it. For instance say, charlestechy.com.ng is your primary domain, but you might also wish to register charlestechy.com.org, charlestechy.ng, charlestechy.com etc… and point them all to the same website.#Cloaking, #Redirection, #Masking, #ForwardingSub-DomainSubdomains are based on prefixes added before a given domain name. They are a great way to organize your site or create sub-websites that while different, still make sense to include under the same domain. For example, we’ve set our Charlestechy videos to be accessible via videos.charlestechy.com.ng We also set our webmail to be accessible via email.charlestechy.com.ng You can create as many sub-domains as you wish for any of your domain names.As you can see, there are a lot of different ways to use your domain names with Namecheap.

Integrating TypeScript with Webpack,https://medium.com/jspoint/integrating-typescript-with-webpack-4534e840a02b?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Typescript,Web Development,JavaScript,Javascript Development,Programming","(source: unsplash.com)If you haven’t read the TypeScript Compilation lesson, then first go through it once. The knowledge of the TypeScript compilation process and the tsconfig.json file is necessary to understand this lesson.Understanding TypeScript’s “Compilation Process” & the anatomy of “tsconfig.json” fileIn this lesson, we are going to learn about the settings of the TypeScript compiler and the usage of the tsconfig.json…medium.comI am assuming that you know what Webpack is and what it is used for. But those who don’t, Webpack is a bundling tool primarily used to combine multiple files together to produce a single bundle. For example, you can combine multiple JavaScript files together to produce one main.js which you will eventually import in the Web application using a <script> tag.But what separates Webpack from task runners such as Grunt or Gulp is the other functionalities it provides. You can transpile TypeScript to JavaScript on the fly and the resultant JavaScript will be used for bundling. You can also transpile SCSS (SASS) to CSS and make a .css bundle.But Webpack in reality is just a bundling tool. The job of transplanting code and performing other operations on the bundle (while Webpack is generating the bundle or after bundles are created) are performed by Webpack loaders and Webpack plugins. These are the external JavaScript programs commonly provided through open-source NPM packages.Babel is a program that can independently transpile one version of JavaScript to another version of JavaScript. For example, if you want to transpile ES6 to ES5, then you can use Babel for that. Babel provides a CLI tool that can do this by simply running babel es6.js --out-file es5.js command.Babel doesn’t have a clue about Webpack. But you could ask Webpack to compile a JavaScript file using Babel before it is bundled with other JavaScript files such that the final JavaScript bundle strictly contains ES5 code. This is taken care of by the babel-loader which is an external JavaScript program that glues Webpack and Babel together.💡 I have discussed how Babel works and also a little about Webpack plugins and loaders in “How to quickly transpile JavaScript using Babel alone.” article.So the question is, why would you ever need Webpack if TypeScript compiler (TSC) can transpile TypeScript to JavaScript. Well, in most cases, you don’t. But the TSC isn’t designed to do everything for you. It can compile TypeScript to JavaScript, produce declaration files, produce source maps, and even produce a bundle file using outFile compile-option.But the outFile option won’t work in all the scenarios. If the output module system is set to ES6, CommonJS or anything other than None, System or AMD, TSC won’t be able to produce a bundle file. I have already explained this Compilation lesson (under the outFile section).The reason why TSC won’t allow you to do this is that a bundle file with import (ES6) or require() (CommonJS) statements will try to import files from the disk (or network) at runtime but you have all the files (code) in the same bundle. There are other sorts of problems as well with this method.However, Webpack solves these issues by replacing import and export statements with the helper functions in the output bundle. These helper functions do what exactly import/export or require/module.exports statements do but within the same bundle and without the help of a module system. Therefore the final bundle can run in any environment such as browser or Node.You could also use Webpack with TypeScript to do other things such as process SASS (.scss) file imports and produce a .css bundle. You could also use Webpack to split the output bundle into multiple files such as main.js and vendor.js that TSC currently can’t do.It’s ideal in most Web projects that use TypeScript to configure Webpack as the bundling tool. TypeScript compiler is designed to compile TypeScript and if you want to do more, you need to use Webpack or another bundling tool that provides seamless integration with TypeScript.Now that we have settled with Webpack, let’s understand how Webpack works with TypeScript. As we know, TSC needs a tsconfig.json file for the compilation (but not necessary), Webpack needs webpack.config.js file (also not necessary) which provides configuration about the files to bundle.Like Babel, Webpack depends on TSC to transpile TypeScript to JavaScript but as TSC doesn’t have a clue about Webpack, hence Webpack needs a loader to talk to TSC. This is where the ts-loader comes into play.Webpack compiles a TypeScript file using ts-loader package which asks TSC to do the compilation. The result of this compilation will be JavaScript code that will be used to make a bundle. So in the end, we have a JavaScript bundle file with mangled import/export statements generated from .ts files. This whole process is explained in the following diagram.As shown in the above diagram, the input files a.ts, b.ts and c.ts are compiled to JavaScript files using ts-loader which uses the TypeScript compiler under the hood. Then the final JavaScript files are bundled by Webpack which can undergo further processes.But the story is far from over. We need to configure Webpack using a webpack.config.js file to use the ts-loader package when the input files have .ts extension. As this compilation of these files is done using the rudimentary TypeScript compiler, we also need to configure TSC using tsconfig.json file. So let’s get started.● Setting up Webpack and TypeScriptBefore we do anything else, we need to set up a project and install some dependencies. For Webpack, we need webpack and webpack-cli package and for TypeScript features, we need typescript and ts-loader packages.$ npm init -y$ npm install -D webpack webpack-cli typescript ts-loaderNow that all the dependencies are ready to be used, we need to create the webpack.config.js file which is used to tell Webpack which files to be bundled, which loaders need to be used, how to bundle output files and other important configurations about this bundling process.(source: gist.github.com)According to the above webpack.config.js, the entry point of the bundling (hence the compilation) process is index.ts file inside src directory (relative to this file). The output bundle file will be main.js and it will be dumped inside dist directory (relative to this file).The resolve.extensions list contains the extension Webpack will use to search a file when an import statement is found in a program. For example, import x from './y' will resolve in the lookup of ./y.ts and ./y.js according to the above configuration. Therefore, you don’t need to provide all the program files as entry files in the Webpack configuration.The most important part of this configuration is module.rules. This is a list of loader configuration rules that will be matched for all entry files (including imported files). If the path of the file matches the test pattern but not the exclude pattern, then it will be filtered through loaders specified by use.💡 You can learn more about this file from the official documentation.(source: gist.github.com)The second important part of the project compilation is the tsconfig.json file that controls how a TypeScript file is compiled. As you can see, it’s not nearly as complicated as we have learned in other lessons.At the moment, a .ts file will be transpiled to the ES5 version of JavaScript (target) and all import statements will be kept in the ES2015 format (module) in the output. You can also set the module to CommonJS as Webpack can also handle the CommonJS module system.The noImplicitAny compiler-option is used to disallow a value implicitly having the any type. If any error TypeScript related error occurs during the compilation (such as implicit any), Webpack will stop with an error by printing the TSC errors to the console.(source: gist.github.com)So the final package.json file looks like above. The main field points to the final bundle produced by the Webpack in case this project will be used as an NPM module. The build script contains the command to start the Webpack bundling process which at the moment only contains webpack command./webpack-setup├── dist|  └── main.js├── node_modules/...├── package.json├── src|  ├── index.ts|  └── lib|     └── classes.ts├── tsconfig.json└── webpack.config.jsCurrently, our project structure looks like above. The dist folder and files in it will be generated by the Webpack so ignore it for now. The src directory contains the actual program files. The index.ts imports lib/classes.ts, hence it will also be a part of the compilation.Now to actually compile the project with Webpack, we need to use npm run build command which internally will call webpack command. You can also use npx webpack command without having to modify package.json.You should visit this repository to see the actual source code of the src directory. The classes.ts file exports the Person class and index.ts file imports and instantiates it. It has a console.log statement to print the result of person.getFullName() method call which returns the name of the person.$ node dist/main.js John DoeYou can run the final bundle file main.js using node which prints the full name of the person. You can also run the main.js bundle in a browser and it will also print the same result. This is possible because the main.js doesn’t contain import/export statements. Rather, its code looks like below.(source: gist.github.com)As you can see, this file doesn’t contain import or export statements. Rather, this file contains some helper functions injected by Webpack to process modules. Also, all the code is transformed in the ES5 syntax.● Generate Source MapsSo far, we have managed to produce the main.js bundle file by compiling TypeScript programs. However, when we use this code in actual production, we might need to debug this file such as using browser’s DevTool while looking for errors. If your code looks like above, it will take years for you to find the bug. That’s where source maps come in.A source map .map file contains the original source codes of the files from which the final bundle was created. This file is used by DevTools to display the original source code while debugging. However, we need to configure both Webpack and TypeScript to produce these files.First of all, we need to set sourceMap compiler-option to true in the tsconfig.json. Using this, TSC will return a .map file (along with the .js file) which contains the actual source code of the .ts file. The ts-loader will supply this source map file to Webpack to take further action.// tsconfig.json{  ""compilerOptions"": {    ...    ""sourceMap"": true  }}The next thing we need to do is to give devtool property to an appropriate value inside webpack.config.js so that Webpack can generate an appropriate source map. You can find possible values for it here. I have used 'source-map' value to generate exclusive .map file for the bundle.// webpack.config.jsmodule.exports = {  devtool: 'source-map',  // generate source map  ...};After these settings, when you compile the project using the same old npm run build command, you get main.js.map file in the dist directory.webpack-setup/dist/├── main.js└── main.js.mapThe main.js.map file contains all the original TypeScript file sources (such as index.ts and classes.ts) which will be available in the DevTool. To visualize this, import main.js inside index.html file and open it inside a browser using live-sever (or any other means).(source: Chrome DevTools)If you want to continuously run Webpack in the background and compile the project again whenever a .ts file changes, set watch option to true in the webpack.config.js file. Now, whenever a file included in the compilation process changes, Webpack will rebuild the project.● Making builds fasterWhen you compile this project, TypeScript has to run a full type analysis on all the .ts files included in the Webpack compilation and produce JavaScript output. This can take a lot of time if you have hundreds of TypeScript files in the project. This problem is quite evident if you have watch mode on.To mitigate this issue, we can split the job of analyzing types and transpiling JavaScript between two different threads. First of all, we need to set the transpileOnly option of the ts-loader to true. This will configure ts-loader to avoid full type analysis by the TSC.Then we need to install fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin NPM module which is a Webpack plugin that runs the type analysis of the .ts files included in the compilation on a separate thread. With this setup, we get the best of both worlds but running parallelly on separate threads. The new webpack.config.js file looks like below.(source: gist.github.com)This approach has a few problems as described here. These problems are bound to occur since the TypeScript compiler at the moment does not provide a mechanism to transpile TypeScript to JavaScript without having to perform type analysis first. Therefore, the ts-loader has to use some tricks to get around it. The issue is raised here to provide a flag --transpileOnly that should technically make this happen but it’s an open issue.💡 However, TSC does provide noEmit compiler-option (and --noEmit) to only perform type analysis on the code without having to produce any output. This option is mostly used by third-party tools to analyze TypeScript programs.I would recommend you to follow this method only when the rebuild time is painstakingly large. In any case, you should also use a production Webpack config that doesn’t use this plugin so that TSC could create a build after performing type analysis on all .ts files involved in the compilation. You can use --config flag with the webpack command to provide a custom Webpack config file path as described here.Doing More with WebpackYou can also provide or modify compiler options of the tsconfig.json file using the compilerOptions settings of the ts-loader rule.If you want to further optimize the code produced by TSC, use babel-loader with ts-loader. The babe-loader, as discussed in this lesson, optimizes the JavaScript code. As first we need to compile a .ts file using ts-loader and then using babel-loader, the use value looks will be like this ['babel-loader', 'ts-loader'] as the loaders are applied from right to left (documented here).Use output.libraryTarget and other library related options in the webpack.config.js to generate a library bundle that can be used as an ES6 or CommonJS module. This process is described in this lesson.If you want to generate declaration files for each .ts file, set declaration compiler-option to true in the tsconfig.json along with declarationDir compiler-option. Using this, TSC will produce .d.ts file for each .ts file in the directory indicated by declarationDir.Use Webpack’s SplitChunksPlugin plugin to split the final bundle file into multiple chunks (smaller bundles) so that it would be easier for the browsers to load these files.

How do Web Browsers Work?,https://medium.com/dev-genius/how-do-web-browsers-work-1245d5b06c51?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Web Development,Software Development,Programming,Web,UI","Critical Rendering Path, Speculative Parsing, Render Blocking Resources, and structure of Web Browsers.Fig. We Browsers (Source: Pixbay)The Web Browser is inarguably the most common portal for users to access the web. The advancement of the web browsers (through the series of history) has led many traditional “thick clients” to be replaced by browser enhancing its usability and ubiquity. The web browser is an application that provides access to the webserver, sends a network request to URL, obtain resources, and interactively represent them. Common Browsers today include Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer and Opera.Structure of Web BrowserFig. Structure of Web Browser1. User InterfaceIt is a space where interaction between user and browser (application) occurs via the control presented in the browser. No specific standards are imposed on how web browsers should look and feel. The HTML5 specification doesn’t define UI elements but lists some common elements: location bar, personal bar, scrollbars, status bar, and toolbar.2. Browser EngineIt provides a high-level interface between UI and the underlying rendering engine. It makes a query and manipulates the rendering engine based upon the user interaction. It provides a method to initiate loading the URL, takes care of reloading, back, and forward browsing action.3. Rendering EngineThe Rendering Engine is responsible for displaying the content of the web page on the screen. The primary operation of a Rendering engine is to parse HTML. By default, it displays HTML, XML, and images and supports other data types via plugin or extension.Fig. The flow of Rendering EngineRendering Engine for modern web BrowsersFirefox — Gecko SoftwareSafari — WebKitChrome, Opera (15 onwards) — BlinkInternet Explorer — TridentCritical Rendering PathTo plot the pixels in the screen (first render), the browser after receiving the data (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) from the network has to go through a series of processes/techniques called Critical Rendering Path. This includes DOM, CSSOM, Render Tree, Layout, and Painting.Data to DOMThe requested content from the networking layer is received in the rendering engine (8 kb chunks generally) in the binary stream format. The raw bytes are then converted to a character (based upon character encoding) of the HTML file.Characters are then converted into tokens. Lexer carries out lexical analysis, breaking input into tokens. During tokenization, every start and end tags in the file are accounted for. It knows out how to strip out irrelevant characters like white space and line breaks. The parser then carries out syntax analysis, applying the language syntax rule to construct a parse tree by analyzing the document structure.The parsing process is iterative. It will ask the lexer for a new token and the token will be added to the parse tree if the language syntax rule match. The parser will then ask for another token. If no rule matches, the parser will store the token internally and keep asking for tokens until rule matching all the internally stored token is found. If no rule is found, then the parser will raise the exception. This means the document was not valid and contained syntax errors.These nodes are linked in the tree data structure called DOM (Document Object Model) which establishes the parent-child relationship, adjacent sibling relationships.Fig. DOM Tree (source: https://developer.google.com)CSS Data to CSSOMRaw bytes of CSS data are converted into character, token, node, and finally in CSSOM (CSS Object Model). CSS has something called cascade which determines what styles are applied to the element. Styling data to the element can come from parents (via inheritance) or are set to the elements themselves. The browser has to recursively go through the CSS tree structure and determine the style of the particular element.Fig. CSSOM Tree (source: https://developer.google.com)DOM and CSSOM to Render TreeDOM tree contains the information about HTML elements relationship and the CSSOM tree contains information on how these elements are styled. Starting from the root node the browser traverses each of the visible nodes. Some nodes are hidden (controlled via CSS) and not reflected in the rendered output. For each visible node, the browser matches the appropriate rule defined in CSSOM and finally, these nodes are emitted with their content and styling called Render tree (Layout Tree).Fig. Render Tree (source: https://developer.google.com)LayoutIt then proceeds to the next level called layout. The exact size and position of each of the content should be calculated to render on a page (browser viewport). The process is also referred to as reflow. HTML uses a flow-based layout model, meaning geometry is computed in a single pass most of the time. It is a recursive process starting from the root element (<html>) of the document.PaintingEach of the renderers is traversed and the paint method is called to display the content on the screen. The painting process can be global (painting the entire tree) or incremental (the render tree validates its rectangle on-screen) and OS generates the paint event on that specific nodes and the whole tree is not affected. Painting is a gradual process where some parts are parsed and rendered while the process continues with the rest of the item from the network.For analyzing, measuring, and optimizing Critical Rendering Path, refer here.4. JavaScript Interpreter (JS Engine)JavaScript is a scripting language that allows you to dynamically update the web content, control multimedia, and animated images executed by the browser’s JS engine. DOM and CSSOM provide an interface to JS which can alter both DOM and CSSOM. Since the browser is unsure what particular JS will do, it will immediately pause the DOM tree construction after it encounters the script tag. Every script is a parse blocker; the DOM tree construction is halted.The JS engine begins parsing the code right away after fetching from the server feeding into the JS parser. It converts them into the representative object the machine understands. The object that stores all the parser information in the tree representation of the abstract syntactic structure is called an object syntax tree (AST). The objects are fed into an interpreter which translates those objects into byte code.These are Just In Time (JITs) compiler meaning JavaScript files downloaded from the server is compiled in real-time on the client’s computer. The interpreter and compiler are combined. The interpreter executes source code almost immediately; the compiler generates machine code which the client system executes directly.Different Browser uses different JS EngineChrome — V8 (JavaScript engine) (Node JS was built on top of this)Mozilla — SpiderMonkey (formerly known as ‘Squirrel Fish’)Microsoft Edge — ChakraSafari — JavaScriptCore / Nitro WebKit5. UI Back EndIt is used for drawing a basic widget like combo boxes and windows. Underneath it uses operating system user interface methods. It exposes a generic platform that is not platform-specific.6. Data StorageThis layer is persistent which helps the browser to store data (like cookies, session storage, indexed DB, Web SQL, bookmarks, preferences, etc). The new HTML5 specification describes a database that is a complete database in a web browser.7. NetworkingIt handles all kinds of network communication within the browser. It uses a set of communication protocols like HTTP, HTTPs, FTP while fetching the resource from requested URLs.Web Browser relies on DNS to resolve the URLs. The records are cached in the browser, OS, router, or ISP. If the requested URL is not cached in, the ISP DNS server initiates the DNS query to find the IP of that server. After receiving the correct IP address the browser establishes the connection with the server with protocols. The browser sends the SYN(synchronize) packet to the server asking if it is open for TCP connection. The server responds with ACK(acknowledgment) of the SYN packet using the SYN/ACK packet.The browser receives an SYN/ACK packet from the server and will acknowledge by sending an ACK packet. Then TCP connection is established for data communication. Once the connection is established, data transfer is ready. To transfer the data, the connection must meet the requirements of HTTP Protocol including connection, messaging, request, and response rules.Render Blocking and Parser Blocking ResourcesWhenever the Browser encounters an element for loading external CSS a request is sent over the network to fetch the .css file asynchronously. It will move immediately (without waiting for CSS resources to be downloaded) to parse elements below it and the DOM construction process is not halted. However, even after DOM tree construction without CSSOM being ready, the Browser won’t render anything into the screen. In order to render, both DOM and CSSOM have to be constructed. Hence HTML and CSS both are both render-blocking resources. Rendering Content without CSS being fully loaded cause Flash Of Unstyled Content (FOUC).Fig. Render Blocking CSS (with parallel loading)However, that is not the case with Javascript. Whenever the browser encounters a script tag, the DOM construction process is immediately paused until the Js file is downloaded and executed. This is because JavaScript has the capability to alter the parsing of subsequent markup (DOM, CSSOM). This makes Javascript a parser-blocking resource.Fig. Parser Blocking JS (with sequential loading)Defer and Async in ScriptBoth defer and async attributes help the developer to specify the asynchronous mode of Javascript Execution.Fig. Js Execution in deferred and async modeSpeculative ParsingAs we have seen whenever a script is encountered, parsing is paused. This will introduce a delay in discovering the rest of the resources. In 2008, Microsoft introduced the concept of preloading named “lookahead downloader” followed by Firefox, Chrome, and Safari the same technique under different names. Chrome and Safari have “the preload scanner” and Firefox — the speculative parser.The basic idea is discovered files are added to a list and start downloading in the background on parallel connections. The files may be available by the time script finishes execution. Here the next lightweight parser scans the rest of the markup looking for other required resources. In the case of other Browsers except for Firefox the contents are preloaded but Firefox (version 4 onwards )goes a step ahead to create a DOM tree speculatively. If speculation succeeds, there is no need to re-parse part of the file constitution DOM. The downside is that if speculation fails, there is more work lost.Why does the same website looks different across Browsers?Many factors come into play for the discrepancy of the same web pages across different Browsers. As different browsers have different Browser engines (Render Engine and Javascript Engine collectively) that interpret source code (HTML and CSS) in slightly different ways causing this inconsistency. Similarly, the styling of web pages often guided by default settings can lead to the discrepancy as the default settings are different across Browsers.Other reasons for the disparity include computer settings (screen resolution, color balancing, OS-level differences, fonts), bugs in the engine, and bugs in the web page.Comparison of BrowsersThere are many different web browsers in the market today. Although the primary application of the browser is the same, they differ from each other in more than one aspect. The distinguishing areas are platform(Linux, Windows, Mac, BSD, and other Unix), protocols, graphical user interface (Real, Headless), HTML5, open-source, and proprietary, explained in detail here.Happy Browsing!!!Referenceshttps://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/howbrowserswork/https://grosskurth.ca/papers/browser-archevol-20060619.pdfhttps://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/https://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-LC/https://developer.mozilla.org/Dev GeniusCoding, Tutorials, News, UX, UI and much more related to developmentFollow127 Sign up for Best StoriesBy Dev GeniusThe best stories sent monthly to your email. Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

Make a Vue.js library to keep your components,https://medium.com/@aliafsah1988/make-a-vue-js-library-to-keep-our-components-62fde3659ea6?source=tag_archive---------2-----------------------,"Vue,Software Architecture,Vuejs,Web Development,Front End Development","IntroductionI was working on a project written with Nuxt.js (https://nuxtjs.org/). As you know Nuxt.js is created on top of the Vue.js (https://vuejs.org/), so they share the same component based approach. And based on that, we split the whole application into small and reusable components.We didn’t use any ready-to-use UI library/framework for our components (such as Quasar, Vuetify) so all of our components were written by our team, because our UI designers were very detailed and we need to have flexibility and customization in any level to create pixel perfect user interfaces based on their designs.We kept all of our components inside the components directory of our Nuxt.js app as it recommends.A demandAfter a while we had a demand to create a dashboard (admin panel) for our internal works and other activities which we couldn’t put them to the main website and it was better we kept them in a separate project. So we chose Vue.js again because it’s a stack of our main website (we tried to keep the same stack in our front-end projects as possible) and most importantly we needed lots of components on Vue.js which we already had on our main website and obviously we didn’t want to write them from the scratch (because it’s ridiculous!) and we definitely didn’t want to keep them in two separate places and make maintaining a disaster in the future. Imagine every single change and bug fix should be taken care of in two places!!! Impossible right! Or should I say stupid!Long story short, we must put all of our components in a separated project and use it in our main website and newly created dashboard as a dependency. Which seems a best practice to me so far and many people do this around the globe.So this new project should contain our components and these components should be used in other projects. So we have no pages here! There is no point to have some empty pages or some pages to just show a bunch of components and it’s a waste of energy and time (because we can use a storybook (https://storybook.js.org/) and I’m going to talk about it in another article). This led me to find out about vue library projects. These projects have no App.vue (as a starting point for a showable web application) and just contain a bunch of components, helpers, utils and other stuff to be shared and used in a couple of other projects. We can write proper tests for them and keep any related logic and functionality there. The upper layer (the other apps which use our projects) don’t need to know about our internal stuff and with a proper build they can use it like any other dependencies.SolutionFortunately for us, vue-cli (https://cli.vuejs.org/) made it very easy by a few steps which I’m going to explain here. It uses the Webpack (https://webpack.js.org/) behind the scenes and provides lots of useful tools.Of Course there are other ways like using Webpack directly which is more flexible but we didn’t need that kind of flexibility and we were out of time.If you don’t know about Webpack and how to configure it, I strongly recommend to take a deep look at it first. If you just use things like vue-cli and don’t learn about what they’re doing behind the scenes, it might get you away from basic stuff and deep knowledge which will cause you many problems in the future and it’s a poison for any kind of engineer.How to create and useNow the steps:Install vue-cli to use its tools and templates. By below command we’re going to install it globally on our machine:npm install -g @vue/cli2. Create a new project with it:vue create [your-awesome-project]3. Set your required configurations:I’m just choosing Babel (https://babeljs.io/) and nothing more to have a very light project.4. Go to your root directory and open the project with your preferred editor or IDE. I use VsCode (https://code.visualstudio.com/).5. Run the project with just typing:npm run serveAs you can see it’s a simple template to run a simple vue project.6. Remove App.vue in the src folder. You don’t need it! Also you can get rid of logo.png in the assets folder and HelloWord.vue in components folder.7. Create your first component.I just created a simple component for this example.Simple Component with Vue.jsIt’s a button which takes a string as a prop (text) and shows it in it’s Inner Html.8. Export this component to be used by others. For that:Add an index.js file into components folder with just below content:import Button from ‘./Button’export { Button }It will export Button.vue by name to the upper layer.Then replace the content of the main.js in src folder with these:export * from ‘./components’By that we’re saying to main.js to export everything in components directory as named export. You can use any other way you prefer.9. Replace your current build script in package.json with the line below:“build”: “vue-cli-service build — target lib — name ui-components src/main.js”By using — target we can specify the type of build we want (https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/build-targets.html). Also we can declare a name and an entry point to start the building process and Webpack, in our case main.js.When you run npm run build, this script is gonna build a folder (by default dist) inside your root directory by webpack and we told vue.js to make it as a library and not a website.10. By running the build script, as you can see we have dist folder like this:Each file can be used in a different situation.A lib build outputs:dist/[YOUR_LIBRARY].common.js: A CommonJS bundle for consuming via bundlers.dist/[YOUR_LIBRARY].umd.js: A UMD bundle for consuming directly in browsers or with AMD loadersdist/[YOUR_LIBRARY].umd.min.js: Minified version of the UMD build.dist/[YOUR_LIBRARY].css: Extracted CSS file (can be forced into inlined by setting css: { extract: false } in vue.config.js)11. So if we want to use this project as a dependency package, we should use [YOUR_LIBRARY].common.js as the primary entry point to our project. For that we just need to set the main property in package.json:“main”: “./dist/vue-lib-sample.common.js”Note: If you’re using git, make sure you removed the dist folder from .gitignore file so you can have it on your remote repo.13. Now we can use it as a npm package or anyway we want. In this example I’m going to use it directly as a local dependency in another project.In my upper layer project I’m just installing our project as dependency with npm:npm add [PATH_OF_PROJECT]So my package.json will be updated like this:“dependencies”: {…“vue-lib-sample”: “file:[some_path]/vue-lib-sample”}And as you can see it’s added to our node_modules:Note: In this approach (local dependency) you might face some linting issues. In my case I didn’t use any linting in both projects.Now we can use our Button component in any where we want!ConclusionIt’s a good practice to keep your components in a separated project, and isolate them from outside. They’re going to be reusable and you just need to change them in just one place. Also by adding a storybook you can make life easier for the whole team, including developers, designers and everybody else.Vue.js usage of a vue library packageYou can find relate repo here:https://github.com/aliafsah1988/vue-lib-sampleWritten byAli AfsahSoftware enthusiast, music loverFollow88 88 88 VueSoftware ArchitectureVuejsWeb DevelopmentFront End DevelopmentMore from Ali AfsahFollowSoftware enthusiast, music loverMore From MediumGeneric Firebase data accessDarren NeimkeHow I dealt with over 30,000 ESLint errorsMichael Chang in JavaScript In Plain EnglishProp, Lock, and Drop itHugo RodriguezBeginner’s Guide to Numeral.JsMatthew Croak in The StartupAngular: Keeping it Fat, Dumb, and HappyTodd Palmer in Angular In DepthReact Socks and Responsive Web Design With ReactPaige Niedringhaus in Better ProgrammingGetting Started With Serverless FrameworkOsusara Kammalawatta in FAUNRecoil: A New  State Management Library Moving Beyond Redux and the Context APIJennifer Fu in Better ProgrammingAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

"As a web developer, should you switch to a more niche field?",https://medium.com/@iwaninzurich/as-a-web-developer-should-you-switch-to-a-more-niche-field-8a048aae632b?source=tag_archive---------4-----------------------,"Careers,Web,Web Development,Programming,Software Development","Taken from mixpanelIn my day job in technical recruitment I talk to dozens of tech firms and hundreds of software engineers every week. Some developers think the web domain is crowded with too many developers and that salaries will go down because of it. I was asked by a reader if it makes sense to pivot to other, specialized domains with a growing market. Here are some ideas:Systems EngineeringSometimes software engineers perform operations on top of their development tasks, some end up enjoying it and switching to systems engineering entirely. They’re then mostly freed from other tasks such as the expectation to “fix something on the frontend”. Their focus becomes doing things on the command line or with special DevOps tools such as Ansible, Docker, or Terraform.On every team of ten or so developers, there is maybe one DevOps/system engineer. The person’s job is to keep the infrastructure running for the developers, test engineers, and users.It is hard to assess systems engineers because of the multitude of tools and skills that are used. Interviews consist of questions about which technology would be used in which scenario and if there is a match between tech used at the employer and by the candidate.Also, be aware that this job can include on-calls. If it is at night or at weekends this can be both a bug and a feature because you’re paid more after working hours and on Sundays, at least in Europe.The way to succeed in DevOps is to be an asset for both developers and the business. E.g., realize what things could be used “as a service” as opposed to building stuff in-house. What is better for your firm: Serverless or Kubernetes? Algolia or your own ElasticSearch cluster?Firms that require a systems engineer aren’t small and usually shouldn’t lowball you in compensation. Systems engineers get respect from developers for being able to keep apps running and scaling them up as needed. That is not the case with other specializations.ERP/proprietary technologiesGeneralist software engineers often look down on technologies such as SAP and people who develop in it. Being forced to work in closed-source software carries some stigma to it.Developers who are forced to use the technology of one specific firm need to attend training that costs thousands of dollars just to learn the details of the language because there is often no other option. (Luckily, this is most often paid by employers.)Albeit it is true that most proprietary technology stacks are quite limited in what they can do (some aren’t even Turing complete), they are among the most used programming languages in the world, because so much important software relies on them. Many banking solutions are technologies that are 40+ years old.If you don’t like the fast-paced nature of the web, proprietary technologies might be an excellent alternative; very few things change there. Since many COBOL developers retire while the need to maintain legacy software stays, it might make sense for some people to pivot to it.Many developers in ERP are career changers, they come from — for instance — chemistry or physics, STEM fields with few job openings. This is a sign of a solid job market and good job security. Firms using this software often don’t have the hire-and-fire mentality or money issues of smaller firms. The field has many veterans who hold tacit knowledge in their heads. Once you gain it, you can become an “irreplaceable employee”.For example, if you are already familiar with JavaScript it is easy to pivot to Oracle NetSuite. I hear it can be very financially rewarding.Test engineeringSoftware engineering isn’t like other forms of (real world) engineering. It has unpredictable elements and requirements change all the time.Some software engineers look down on testers because they think they aren’t “producing anything”. Albeit there are manual testers that do rather repetitive tasks, test engineers write software to uncover broken elements and come up with creative ways to show the weaknesses of systems. These engineers don’t produce a product for end-users, but they produce useful information.As a software engineer, you often can follow some kind of blueprint: Start with the UX/design, then build a frontend, set up a backend, database, use this or that library. As a test engineer, you need a different skillset. Here, mostly heuristics work, there is no clear path to follow. This is like coming up with mathematical proofs; you need a leap of creativity to get it done.As companies increasingly learn the value of reliable software and happy users, they invest more money in testing and the salaries grow with it. Small companies don’t hire test engineers, unless they have a sense of quality and how heavily their product affects users (e.g could it kill someone/loose money); so mainly middle-sized or big firms hire test engineers more likely.CybersecurityWhile the mindset in software engineering is about building things, security is about how things can be destroyed, how bad events can be mitigated or how to deal with breaches after they occur.Cybersecurity is not a standardized field, it ranges from checking boxes in excel sheets to pen testing/hacking as a ‘red team’ to building systems that can survive such red-team attacks.Advanced practitioners think beyond this. They assume it is a question of when, not if, you will be hacked, and so you should work your way backward from there on how to survive such an event. That is easier said than done because humans think in probabilities. They often only consider harm that is likely. However, the thing to focus on is impact. You should ask yourself “what can wipe me out?” and try to prepare for that instead of only predictable problems with low impact. You can use threat modeling to find out likely points of compromise, and prioritize which ones need to be fixed.Juniors tend to get tricked into cybersecurity jobs at auditing firms, hoping it will be cool but ending up in boring endeavors like having to survey employees about their password strengths and checkboxes in an Excel file.Small- or middle-sized firms don’t (yet) care about security. Only bigger companies hire such professionals, and you need to find a firm where they take security seriously and where they don’t just make a pseudo-effort to make the auditors happy. There are often more jobs in consulting companies that specialize in security, but the downside here is that you are often traveling or switching between relatively short-term work.Security is a relatively small world, so word-of-mouth often travels fast and far, and you often find new opportunities using organic network connections. Remember this during your job hunt.Unless you work in a security company, selling the value of it isn’t an easy task. You have no shiny app to show or revenue to point to in your salary or promotion negotiation, you have to rely on your management to understand that your work saves your firm from ruin. It is hard to sell something that didn’t happen. Nevertheless, if you are good at breaking things and thinking about defense-in-depth, then you should consider pivoting into security, which can pay well.Mobile developmentOther fields have it easier in this regard and the value is much easier to sell. The world went mobile and is still going. Mobile engineering has its own languages, frameworks, principles, and challenges.I once had to do some work in Xcode and Objective C, and it didn’t seem to be the nicest development environment. Back in the day of the first iPhone it didn’t matter because apps were so in demand that developers didn’t care how unpleasant it was; cost didn’t matter. Now, the development environment became better with Swift and Android and there are more developers out there.Native mobile development gets some competition from the ever-improving cross-platform solutions. React Native and Flutter are on the rise. They seem to be contenders worth looking at. We are hearing that these solutions will enable “write once, run everywhere” already since the first Ionic version, a JavaScript-based framework that allows the cross-platform development of apps. Yet, complex apps likely will always be built in native technologies because only Google and Apple can give all needed access to the underlying hardware.We can be happy that Microsoft stopped their mobile efforts, otherwise, we would have three platforms to develop for and not “just” two. With the world going increasingly mobile, the need for such developers will go up with it. If you worked in Java you can easily switch to Android. If you worked with React you can easily switch to React native. The “switching costs” here are low and the “niche aspect” high enough to justify a bigger compensation. Many firms, small and large, require mobile skills.Embedded developmentEmbedded development is a niche where you have to work most often with C/C++, a language that developers tend to either love or hate. It is an ancient one with pointers and memory problems that can make your life very hard, if you don’t know what you’re doing. Students rarely learn to program in it properly in university. Hence, C/C++ developers are rare nowadays.Embedded jobs are more available in places where you have lots of mechanical engineering, like in Germany. The car industry has a rising demand for embedded technology because of automated vehicles. The same is true for drones in defense and other sectors. Another need is in high-frequency trading but these kinds of firms you find focused in New York City or London and not so much elsewhere. The most recent, big, and rising sector for embedded engineering is the 5G technology. Many of the tools, infrastructure, and network technology around it is written in C/C++ for performance reasons.Exotic programming languagesGenerally, the best engineers don’t care about programming languages all that much and just use whatever is already used by a team. Yet I often hear strong preferences by developers.Some want to use Rust, others Golang or even Haskell. If you’re into side-effect free code, I see why you’d rather code in Ocaml or Haskell and not JavaScript.If you invest enough of your time to learn an exotic stack well enough, there is a chance that a firm that actually wants “3-years experience in XYZ” might interview you, but only if you can showcase that you invested 3–4 months of work into doing work in the needed stack. Sometimes salaries might be lower because many want to work with cool, new technology, or salaries might be higher because of the industry. For instance, in finance many use Haskell.Machine Learning, big data, data science, AI, and other career scamsMachine Learning, big data, data science, and AI are fields that sound sexy but the reality can be very different.Only big tech firms have enough data to let a handful of PhDs work with it. There are no jobs for backend developers who used NLTK for one weekend. Try putting a job advert online for “Machine Learning” and you’ll be flooded with CVs. Each of my clients who had to fill such a role experienced this. People want to pivot to machine learning and even are okay to take a big pay cut. That is not the case with the other fields mentioned in this article.Also, the basis for most “data jobs” is shaky. More data doesn’t mean you can generate more insights. Quite the opposite can be the case. More data, algorithms, and software can make you more confused and gets you “fooled by randomness”. I see for instance publishing houses putting out machine learning positions to help journalists generate “insights”. At some point, they will find out that this is pure “fugazi”. Some firms just take old “data analytics” positions and rename them to “machine learning”. Still, the only thing hires will do is calculate means/medians and standard deviations, in Excel VB scripts, if they are unlucky.Of course, self-driving cars and similar fields need “real” machine learning engineers. But how many jobs are there? Very few. This field is for people who meet three criteria: They can code really well, they have an academic track record, and they live in a region where companies do real machine learning. That is mostly the Bay Area tech giants and their satellite offices. Of course, there is a startup here and there that also does serious stuff, but the market is small. Maybe I am wrong speaking that negatively about machine learning, but at the moment that is my impression of the market.SummaryEvery person “gets sick” of something they do long enough. You have to analyze why you want to switch fields. Is it temporary unhappiness or is something constantly bothering you about what you are doing? If the annoyance stays for many months, it likely is something that won’t change, and you should consider changing careers. Maybe to those mentioned here.No one can really advise you on the details of a career change. You can reach out to people working in the desired field and ask them about their experiences. Be aware that some people working in any field will find what they do boring. Many people are working for the money and get limited satisfaction out of their jobs. One can say: Almost any job sucks in its own unique way at least sometimes. So, don’t feel bad about feeling bad.Once you change a domain you rarely want to get back or change fields again albeit I have seen people going from Python to DevOps to frontend and have no problems with convincing employers that they know what they want. Yet these were shifts within web development.Every career change has switching costs that grow as you age. When you are young, you have more energy and time to focus on studying another field in your free time. In your CV, you need to highlight not only what you did in your job but also in your free time, write down how many weeks, months or years you invested in learning a new skill or how long you exactly worked on a personal project. Writing this properly into a CV is a challenge for most developers and I dedicated a whole chapter to it in “Coderfit: All you need to know for your programming career”. I’d be super happy if you grab a copy and send me any questions you might have.The career changes suggested in this article can be drastic and all the markets of the niche jobs we discussed here are smaller than the current web development market, but they are growing. I am excited to see what the future brings.If you liked reading this post, follow me on Twitter for similar content.I thank Firas Cheaib, Trishannk Karthik Kuppusamy, Ilari Henrik Aegerter, Szilveszter Farkas, Nadia Yudina, Mike Miller for contributing with their expertise and corrections.Originally published at https://coderfit.com on September 12, 2020.Written byIwan GulenkoFollow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/iwangulenko or Linkedin https://linkedin.com/in/iwan-gulenko/Follow16 16 16 CareersWebWeb DevelopmentProgrammingSoftware DevelopmentMore from Iwan GulenkoFollowFollow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/iwangulenko or Linkedin https://linkedin.com/in/iwan-gulenko/More From MediumOptimize BigQuery costs with Flex SlotsPatrick Dunn in Google Cloud - CommunityRuby on Rails: Boost your software design skills with InteractorsLucas PolonuerWhat to Do When You’ve Inherited Dysfunctional CodeAphinya Dechalert in mad<hashmap>Bypassing SSRF ProtectionVickie LiAkka Http Client- How to create a Unit Test for Http Single Request in ScalaEdward Huang in The StartupN64 VR with JavascriptAvaer Kazmer in ExokitThe Technical Interview Guide to BacktrackingJennifer Fu in Better ProgrammingBuilding A Basic Web Server In Golang From ScratchKunal Desai in The StartupAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

This tool can collect IP and location information just by clicking the link.To download this tool, visit the “https://github.com/thelinuxchoice/blackeye” page and copy the downloadable link.Change your directory to “/opt” and use the “git clone” command to download the Blackeye.Ex: (root@kali:/opt# git clone https://github.com/thelinuxchoice/blackeye.git).Navigate to the “/blackeye” folder and type “bash blackeye.sh” to start the tool.On the main page, you’ll be presented with 32 most popular web templates. Select the one you like and hit “Enter” to continue. Here we chose option “8” for Netflix.Provide your local IP address and hit “Enter” to start the PHP server. When anybody tries to browse your local IP address, they will be redirected to the Netflix login page. We suggest changing the IP address link to something less suspicious using some online URL shortener services.Once the victim visits the page, puts the credentials, and hits “Enter,” it’ll redirect to the original login page. The victim will not notice anything and will think that he/she mistyped the password, so the victim will try to re-login again. But on the other hand, the attacker will receive harvested information regarding the victim’s credentials and list them on the Blackeye terminal page.Note: The device works on LAN. “AnonuD4y” is taking a shot at changing the content to incorporate Ngrok services with it, so it works over WAN, yet it has a few issues with starting Ngrok. You can look at that form on GitHub. Additionally, you may think about “Modlishka.” It is a tool that can sidestep two-factor verification of sites, including Google services. You don’t have to clone templates. Modlishka works like an intermediary among you and the server that implies the server runs live. These apparatus are taking phishing techniques to the next level. To give it a try, check out the instructional tutorial on Modlishka from the “https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-tool-automates-phishing-attacks-that-bypass-2fa/” website.“SocialFish”Phishing can be performed with the guide of various instruments in Kali Linux. SocialFish is a standout amongst the most incredible asset for phishing social media’s account and is created by Alisson Moretto. Since SocialFish isn’t an inbuilt apparatus in Kali Linux like SEToolkit, it must be downloaded from the official site of the GitHub page.To download this tool, visit the “https://github.com/UndeadSec/SocialFish” page and copy the downloadable link.Change your directory to “/opt” and use the “git clone” command to download the SocialFish.Ex: (root@kali:/opt# git clone https://github.com/UndeadSec/SocialFish.git).Next, navigate to the “/SocialFish” directory and install the required packages.Ex: (root@kali:/opt/SocialFish# apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-dev –y)Then install everything that is in the “requiremnts.txt” list.Ex: (root@kali:/opt/SocialFish# python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt).Change the mode of the “SocialFish.py” file to an executable (root@kali:/opt/SocialFish# chmod +x SocialFish.py) then run it using “python3” command following by user and password information (root@kali:/opt/SocialFish# python3 SocialFish.py root johdoesecurity).In the SocialFish main page, you’ll be given a local link, use this link to login to the SocialFish web-based page using the provided credentials above.On the web page, first, provide the website link that you want to clone, second specify the website link that you want to redirect, and lastly, click on the lightning icon to start the attack.Copy the attacks URL and send it to your victim. Once the victim visits the page, puts the credentials, and hits “Enter,” the tool will redirect to the original login page. The victim will not notice anything and will think that he/she mistyped the password, so the victim will try to re-login again.On the other hand, the attacker will receive harvested information regarding the victim’s credentials in the “POST LOG” section.Click on “View” under the “POST LOG” tab, and it will redirect you to the page with all captured information.Dev GeniusCoding, Tutorials, News, UX, UI and much more related to developmentFollow30 Sign up for Best StoriesBy Dev GeniusThe best stories sent monthly to your email. Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

Loose vs Strict Equality in JavaScript,https://medium.com/jspoint/loose-vs-strict-equality-in-javascript-3e5136720b00?source=tag_archive---------6-----------------------,"JavaScript,Ecmascript,Nodejs,ES6,Web Development","(source: unsplash.com)You would think, how difficult could it be to compare two values. Well here in JavaScript, it’s a bloody mess. In JavaScript, there are two ways to compare two values. Either we can check two values for the likeness or we can check whether two values are strictly equal in every which way.● Strict EqualityThe Strict Equality operation is what we are used to. Instead of usual == (double equals) operator, we use === (triple equals) operator to perform strict equality check. In this operation, A === B, both A and B should be of the same type else the result will be always false since two values of different data types can’t be equal in any universe. If both have the same data type, then their values are compared.(equality/strict.js)In the above example, we have compared two values together using strict equality operator (===). These values could be as simple strings and booleans of primitive data types or abstract/complex data types such as arrays and objects. It produces the following result.There is a lot to talk about here so let’s go understand once concept at a time.All the strict equality comparison between two incompatible data types are going to return false. So do not even bother thinking of comparing objects with arrays and string with numbers.NaN is a special case in JavaScript since it’s the only value in JavaScript that is not equal to itself. Therefore don’t even think about comparing n === NaN to check if n is NaN since it always returns false. Instead, use the global function isNaN(n). Fun fact, typeof NaN returns ""number"", so NaN is a global value of the type number and it indicates not-a-number.Since null and undefined are globally defined primitives, they are equal to themselves, however, they won’t be equal to each other since they belong to different data types.The Infinity is a globally defined value of type number to signify mathematical infinity. It is equal to itself since it is not NaN.Symbol() call always returns a unique symbol value. Therefore Symbol() === Symbol() always returns false.Non-primitive values such as Array, Object, or Functions aren’t equal to each other except themselves.The !== operator is the negation of === operator.💡 If you do not like how JavaScript treats NaN and you want NaN === NaN to return true, then use Object.is() method. This function performs a strict equality check between two arguments but except in a few cases. Not only it returns true when both arguments are NaN but it returns false for +0 and -0 comparison. This method was introduced in ES6.● Loose/Abstract EqualityThe Loose Equality or Abstract Equality check is check for the likeness of the two values and it is performed using == (double equals) operator. This operator compares if two values look similar. Therefore it relaxes some of the constraints imposed by Strict Equality.(equality/loose.js)Similar to the previous example, we are comparing two JavaScript values together but now with the loose equality operator (===). This produces the following result.So compared to strict equality, there isn’t a single value that has changed here when we replace === (triple equals) operator with == (double equals) operator in the previous program (except null == undefined). That’s because so far we have compared only values of the same data type. As we know, for strict equality to return true, both the values should be of the same data type to begin with. However, that’s not the case with loose equality.(equality/loose-spooky.js)When JavaScript encounter values of the same data types in loose equality operation, it checks whether their values are equal or not, just like the strict equality check. However, when values of different data types are compared using loose equality, JavaScript first coerced one or both of them to the same data type implicitly and performs the strict equality operation.For example, as we can see in the above results, [] == 0 returns true since the array (LHS) value is coerced to a number through a sequence of operations and it yields 0 at the end. Therefore 0 === 0 returns true. The obvious candidate is 0 == ""0"" in which ""0"" (RHS) will be converted to a number, hence 0 and 0 === 0 returns true.How JavaScript decides which value to convert to what data type depends on the type and values of both operands. Therefore it is always recommended to use strict equality while comparing two values since these rules and conversions are impossible to remember. So there is a strong chance that you might miss something and make a million-dollar mistake.You can understand some principles of loose equality from the MDN document, but I would recommend you to read this article that describes how the coercion procession works.💡 The motivation behind this kind of behavior could be because the data types of values really don’t matter that much in JavaScript and it gives the user flexibility to perform sensible operations on similar (likeminded) values.Now that we can see that JavaScript performs operand coercion when it seems necessary to do so, let’s perform some mathematical operations of likeminded operands and see if this behavior is consistent.(equality/arithmetic-operations.js)As you can see from the above results, a + operation with a string operand will always result into the coercion of the other operand to a string and then these two values will be concatenated. This is because + is not only a arithmetic add operator but a string concatenation operator as well, as in ""hello"" + "" world"" results in ""hello world"" string value.However, that’s not the case with -, * and / arithmetic operation or + operation with non-string values. When two operand values undergo these operations, one or both of them are converted to number values. Since these rules of engagement also pose a tough challenge to remember, please try to avoid these kinds of operations.(thatisuday.com / GitHub / Twitter/ StackOverflow / Instagram)JsPointJavaScript and the WebFollow13 Some rights reservedJavaScriptEcmascriptNodejsES6Web Development13 claps13 clapsWritten byUday HiwaraleFollowSenior Software Engineer (JS • Go • Dart • Python) / thatisuday.com ☯ github.com/thatisuday ☯ thatisuday@gmail.comFollowJsPointFollowA collection of essential articles for JavaScript, WebAssembly, TypeScript, Node.js, Deno, and Web development in general.FollowWritten byUday HiwaraleFollowSenior Software Engineer (JS • Go • Dart • Python) / thatisuday.com ☯ github.com/thatisuday ☯ thatisuday@gmail.comJsPointFollowA collection of essential articles for JavaScript, WebAssembly, TypeScript, Node.js, Deno, and Web development in general.More From MediumHow to use the JavaScript Spread operatorHarsh Patel in JavaScript In Plain EnglishHow to use the Vue Transitions ComponentCC Eng in JavaScript In Plain EnglishTransformers For ReactJsJM Santos in Weekly WebtipsUseful JavaScript FunctionsDavid Dal Busco in Better ProgrammingNodeJS Postgresql Bulk upsert.Krishna Prasad in The StartupCleaner React Enzyme TestsGreg Malcolm in Beam DentalHow JavaScript Code is Executed Under the HoodKalkidan Taye in JavaScript In Plain EnglishCombining what I learned from Covid-19 with D3.jsStacy Cho in JavaScript In Plain EnglishLearn more.Medium is an open platform where 170 million readers come to find insightful and dynamic thinking."
Best of Modern JavaScript —Template Literals,https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/best-of-modern-javascript-template-literals-5e6e34124a66?source=tag_archive---------7-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,JavaScript,Software Development","Photo by Brett Jordan on UnsplashSince 2015, JavaScript has improved immensely.It’s much more pleasant to use it now than ever.In this article, we’ll look at JavaScript template literals.Template LiteralsA template literal is a string literal where we can interpolate JavaScript expressions right into the string.For example, we can write:const firstName = 'james';console.log(`Hello ${firstName}`);Then we get:'Hello james'It’s delimited by backticks instead of single and double-quotes.Escaping in Template LiteralsThe backslash is used for escaping inside template literals.For example, we can write:`\``and get:'`'However, we can’t write:`\${`since we’ll get a SyntaxError.Other than that, they work like regular string literals.Line terminators in template literals are always LF.LF is the line feed character, which is \n or U+000A which is used by Unix and macOS.CR, which is \r or U+900D is used by old Mac OS.CRLF, which is \r\n is used by Windows.They’re all normalized to LF in template literals.Tagged Template LiteralsTagged template literals is putting a tag in front of a template literal.For example, we can write:tagFunction`Hello ${firstName} ${lastName}`where tagFunction is a function that we call on the string.It’s the same as writing:tagFunction(['Hello ', ' '], firstName, lastName)The tag takes the template string and substitutions for the placeholder.The substitutions are done at runtime.But template strings are known statically at compile time.Tag functions also gets the raw version which isn’t interpreted.It also gets the final version where the backslashes are special.Raw StringsES6 has the String.raw template tag for raw strings.It returns the string with all the backslashes intact.For example, we can write:const str = String.raw`Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Phasellus fringilla mauris vel erat facilisis lacinia. \nVivamus tincidunt, massa sit amet fermentum rhoncus, nibh mi convallis elit, eget bibendum eros ipsum elementum purus. Donec tristique ligula mi, non dapibus quam finibus et. Orci varius natoque penatibus et magnis dis parturient montes`with the \n intact.This is useful whenever we need to keep the backslashes in our strings.We can use the sh template tag to run shell commands.For example, we can write:const proc = sh`ps ax | grep ${pid}`;Packages like the sh Template Tag package provides us with the sh template tag to run commands with the tag.Facebook GraphQLFacebook Relay lets us make queries to a GraphQL API.For example, we can use it by writing:import React from ""react""import { createFragmentContainer, graphql, QueryRenderer } from ""react-relay""import environment from ""./lib/createRelayEnvironment""import ArtistHeader from ""./ArtistHeader""export default function ArtistRenderer({artistID}) {  return (    <QueryRenderer      environment={environment}      query={graphql`        query QueryRenderersArtistQuery($artistID: String!) {          # The root field for the query          artist(id: $artistID) {            # A reference to your fragment container            ...ArtistHeader_artist          }        }      `}      variables={{artistID}}      render={({error, props}) => {        if (error) {          return <div>{error.message}</div>;        } else if (props) {          return <Artist artist={props.artist} />;        }        return <div>Loading</div>;      }}    />  );}using the example from https://relay.dev/.We just pass in our own template string into the graphql tag to make the request.Photo by Ashley Anderson on UnsplashConclusionTemplate strings are useful.They let us interpolate expressions and call them with tags.JavaScript In Plain EnglishEnjoyed this article?

An Introduction to REST APIs and Microservices,https://medium.com/the-software-design-blog/an-introduction-to-rest-apis-and-microservices-ea9477699b73?source=tag_archive---------8-----------------------,"Soft,Software,Web Development,Web Design,Computer Science","When designing web applications, we often use APIs to incorporate data from different sources into our apps. APIs or Application Programmable Interface form the basis of almost every modern web application. In this blog, we’ll try to explore various protocols/techniques used for making these APIs and the advantages these techniques provide over each other.RESTREST stands for REpresentational State Transfer.REST is an architectural style for designing APIs and is probably the most commonly used architecture these days for web applications. It aims to provide a uniform interface for interaction with data by using several constraints.A lot of people confuse REST with the way HTTP works. REST in itself is not a protocol. Its a set of architectural principles, which intends to make the web more streamlined and uniform. REST uses JSON on top of HTTP(in most cases) to achieve this.The core concept of REST is that the Server has to be completely stateless i.e. it can’t store states. Hence, the server loses the ability to store sessions as well. The session states are stored on Client-Side completely. That is why, whenever a request is made to a REST API, we need to pass in the session data along with the request, as server data has no ability to store them.In REST, every file — Image, CSS, HTML, etc. is called a resource. The state of a resource at a particular timestamp is called the resource representation.Resource Representation = Data + Metadata + Hypermedia LinksHypermedia is the engine of REST Architecture.As the name suggests, the resource representation is transferred from client to server, where the server doesn’t have the ability to store previous states. It can just store the current state of the resource representation.In other words, in the REST architectural style, data and functionality are considered resources and are accessed using Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs). The resources are acted upon by using a set of simple, well-defined operations. The clients and servers exchange representations of resources by using a standardized interface and protocol — typically HTTP. The client is stateful (can store and operate on states) whereas the server is completely stateless(can just store the current state).SOAPSimple Object Access Protocol or SOAP is another paradigm used to build APIs. But unlike REST, SOAP is a communication protocol, just like HTTP.SOAP exclusively using XML for messaging, whereas REST gives us the freedom to use anything — JSON, XML, CSV, etc. for the same.All SOAP RPC Calls are made on top of the HTTP POST Request. Hence, they are not cacheable on Client Side.The Server is stateless in SOAP — but there is no restriction on it. It can be made stateful very easily with minor changes.SOAP is platform and language-dependent, whereas REST is not.Microservice-Based ArchitectureConventional Apps are single units that create a single point of failure. Hence, when a small part of such an application fails or needs to be updated, the whole application is unable to function. This effect of the working of one component on the other is called Coupling.These applications are called Monolithic Applications. They are tightly coupled applications i.e. if one part fails/changes, the whole application might not function or needs to be altered. Over time, this creates problems in maintenance and the quality of the codebase also deteriorates.However, to ensure high availability and ease of maintenance these days, organizations use Microservice Based Architecture in their applications mostly.Microservices are small independent units or services, each running their own process, that comes together to form a larger application or service.Microservices are independent services that run on their own processes. Hence, it helps to maintain the modularity of code.Microservices communicate with each other using lightweight mechanisms like HTTP Resource APIsAs Microservices are independent units, the application thus created has loose coupling i.e. the failure of one part doesn’t affect the other. In fact, Microservices have no knowledge of each other’s existence.Microservices allow cross-language development i.e. different microservices can be written in different languages and hence, can be maintained by different teams.When should we use a Monolith vs Microservices?Monolith Architecture is suited for small to medium scale applications generally. It is used when the application is expected to handle a limited number of users and scaling for a large user base is not an issue(No unexpected/exponential growth of users is expected).In many cases, teams decide to start with a Monolith Architecture and then scale to a Microservice-based Architecture if need be.A Brief History of Scaling LinkedInLinkedIn started in 2003 with the goal of connecting to your network for better job opportunities. It had only 2,700…engineering.linkedin.comMicroservice based Architechtures fit best for complex applications like Social Media Networks etc. where the userbase is expected to rise exponentially at some point in time.A typical e-commerce application has various components such as ordering, inventory check, user accounts, etc. which can be divided into separate microservices, following the Principle of Single Responsibility and Separation of Concerns.e-commerce application simple microservice representationSo, in conclusion, three approaches are possible —Picking a monolithic architecturePicking a microservice architectureStarting with a monolithic architecture and then later scale out into a microservice architecture.Picking a monolithic or a microservice architecture largely depends on our use case.No architecture is the right architecture for anything. Software Engineering is all by scaling and adjusting to the requirements.I’ll suggest, keep things simple, have a thorough understanding of the requirements. Analyze your requirements and build something only when you need it & keep evolving the code iteratively. This is the right way to go.If you like this article, make sure you clap for it and drop your views if you liked or disliked anything.

Implement JavaScript’s new operator yourself — A killer Frontend interview question,https://medium.com/weekly-webtips/implement-javascripts-new-operator-yourself-a-killer-frontend-interview-question-68468ad0a227?source=tag_archive---------9-----------------------,"JavaScript,Front End Development,Interview Questions,Web Development,Javascript Tips","The concept of the new operator is from class-based object-oriented languages such as C++ and Java. It is used to create an instance or object of a class and in general, it mainly does two things: Instantiating — allocating spaces in memory for the object being created, and Initialization — executing the constructor method and initializing the object (e.g. its member variables and member functions).For JavaScript, it is not a class-based language like Java, it is prototype-based, so its new operator does its very specific things and is very different from the new operator in Java.According to MDN:The new operator lets developers create an instance of a user-defined object type or of one of the built-in object types that has a constructor function.For example, we create a constructor function below and use the new operator to create an instance of this constructor function:function Employee(name) {  this.name = name;}const employee = new Employee('Mike');Employee() is just a normal function in JS, and when we use the new operator in front of it, it becomes a “constructor function”. Now an object of the constructor is created, and its reference is assigned to the constant variable employee.As per MDN, the new operator does the following four things:Creates a blank, plain JavaScript object;Links (sets the constructor of) this object to another object;Passes the newly created object from Step 1 as the this context;Returns this if the function doesn't return an object.Also,Creating a user-defined object requires two steps:Define the object type by writing a function.Create an instance of the object with new.With the official definition in hand, let’s implement the new operator ourselves.First, create a function named New. It takes a couple of parameters and the first parameter is the constructor function being passed in. We use the rest syntax to collect the rest parameters into an array named args.function New(constructor, ...args) {}For Step 1 — Creates a blank, plain JavaScript objectLet’s create an empty object in the function body:function New(constructor, ...args) {  // 1. Create a new empty object  const obj = {};  // const obj = new Object();  // const obj = Object.create(null);}Note there are three ways to create an empty object:const obj = {};const obj = new Object();const obj = Object.create(null);So I put the other two in the comments for reference.Now Step 2 — Links (sets the constructor of) this object to another objectThis can be done through one assignment statement:function New(constructor, ...args) {  // 1. Create a new empty object  const obj = {};  // const obj = new Object();  // const obj = Object.create(null);  // 2. Assign the constructor’s prototype property to the new empty object’s __protp__ property  obj.__proto__ = constructor.prototype;  // Object.setPrototypeOf(obj, constructor.prototype);}We set the reference of the constructor’s prototype to the new object’s __proto__ property. Here you could also use Object.setPrototypeOf() and it is normally recommended. Below these two lines do the same thing:obj.__proto__ = constructor.prototype;Object.setPrototypeOf(obj, constructor.prototype);This one single assignment statement sets up the prototype chain for the object obj. It is crucial because it proves that objects in JS rely on prototype and the prototype chain. This is completely different from its “brother” Java (JS was meant to be named “LiveScript” when created in the 1990s, then it was renamed to “JavaScript” because Java came out at that time and was the hottest programming language).Moving on to Step 3 — Passes the newly created object from Step 1 as the `this` contextNow we need to execute the constructor function passed to our New() function:function New(constructor, ...args) {  // 1. Create a new empty object  const obj = {};  // const obj = new Object();  // const obj = Object.create(null);  // 2. Assign the constructor’s prototype property to the new empty object’s __protp__ property  obj.__proto__ = constructor.prototype;  // Object.setPrototypeOf(obj, constructor.prototype);  // 3. Execute the constructor, set obj as the context of `this` when the constructor runs  const result = constructor.call(obj, args);}We do this by using the call() method and save the result in a constant variable result.Finally for Step 4 — Returns `this` if the function doesn’t return an objectWe will check if the result of calling the constructor in Step 3, if it is an object type, then return it. If not, we will return obj as the new object:function New(constructor, ...args) {  // 1. Create a new empty object  const obj = {};  // const obj = new Object();  // const obj = Object.create(null);  // 2. Assign the constructor’s prototype property to the new empty object’s __protp__ property  obj.__proto__ = constructor.prototype;  // Object.setPrototypeOf(obj, constructor.prototype);  // 3. Execute the constructor, set obj as the context of `this` when the constructor runs  const result = constructor.call(obj, args);  // 4. Return the object  return typeof result === 'object' ? result : obj;}All done, let’s test it out. We create an Employee() constructor function and it receives an array of parameters:function Employee(args) {  this.name = args[0];  this.title = args[1];  console.log('constructor, this = ', this);}Now we can use our own New() function to create an object based on the constructor Employee():const employeeA = New(Employee, 'Joe', 27);console.log('employeeA = ', employeeA);Run it and in the console, we can see:A new object employeeA was successfully created using our New() function!There are other ways to implement it and you can add more checks, please leave a comment if you have other versions.Weekly WebtipsExplore the world of web technologies through a series of tutorialsFollow1 Sign up for 💌 Weekly NewsletterBy Weekly WebtipsGet the latest news on the world of web technologies with a series of tutorial Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

It also runs most of the web, all of the world’s top 500 supercomputers, and therefore the world’s stock exchanges.But besides being the platform of option to run desktops, servers, and embedded systems across the world, Linux is one of the foremost reliable, secure, and worry-free operating systems available.History of LinuxWhile still a student at the University of Helsinki, Torvalds began to develop Linux to make a system almost like MINIX, a UNIX. In 1991 he released version 0.02; Version 1.0 of the Linux kernel, the core of the OS, was released in 1994. At an equivalent time, American software developer Richard Stallman and FSF attempted to create an open-source UNIX-like OS called GNU. Unlike Torvalds, Stellman and FSF began building utilities for the primary OS. These utilities were then added to the Linux kernel to make an entire system called GNU / Linux, or, less precisely, simply Linux.Image of Richard StallmanLinux evolved within the 1990s thanks to the efforts of buff developers. Although Linux isn’t as user-friendly because of the popular Microsoft Windows and Mac OS operating systems, it’s an efficient and reliable system that rarely crashes. Combined with Apache, an open-source web server, Linux accounts for quite a 3rd of all servers used on the web. Because it’s open-source and thus suitable for various uses, Linux is popular for systems as diverse as cellular telephones and supercomputers. The addition of a user-friendly desktop environment, office suites, web browsers, and even games helped to extend the recognition of Linux and make it more suitable for home and office desktops. New distributions (Linux software packages) were created within the 1990s. a number of the more well-known distributions include Red Hat, Debian, and Slackware.What is Linux?Like Windows, iOS, and Mac OS, Linux is an OS. In fact, one among the foremost popular platforms on the earth, Android, is powered by the Linux OS. An OS is a software that manages all the hardware resources related to your desktop or laptop. Simply put, the OS manages the communication between your software and your hardware. Without the OS (OS), the software won’t work.The Linux OS includes several different pieces:1.Bootloader — The software that manages the boot process of your computer. for many users, this may simply be a splash screen that pops up and eventually goes away else into the OS.2.Kernel — this is often the one piece of the entire that’s actually called?Linux?. The kernel is that the core of the system and manages the CPU, memory, and peripheral devices. The kernel is the lowest level of the OS.3. Init system — this is often a sub-system that bootstraps the user space and is charged with controlling daemons. one among the foremost widely used init systems is the system? which also happens to be one among the foremost controversial. it’s the init system that manages the boot process, once the initial booting is handed over from the bootloader (i.e., GRUB or GRand Unified Bootloader).4.Daemons — These are background services (printing, sound, scheduling, etc.) that either begin during boot or after you log into the desktop.5.Graphical server — this is often the sub-system that displays the graphics on your monitor. it’s commonly mentioned because of the X server or simply X.6. Desktop environment — this is often the piece that the users actually interact with. There are many desktop environments to settle on from (GNOME, Cinnamon, Mate, Pantheon, Enlightenment, KDE, Xfce, etc.). Each desktop environment includes built-in applications (such as file managers, configuration tools, web browsers, and games).7. Applications — Desktop environments don’t offer a complete array of apps. a bit like Windows and macOS, Linux offers thousands upon thousands of high-quality software titles that will be easily found and installed. The latest Linux distributions (more on this below) include App Store-like tools that centralize and simplify application installation. for instance, Ubuntu Linux has the Ubuntu Software Center (a rebrand of GNOME Software? Figure 1) which allows you to quickly search among the thousands of apps and install them from one centralized location.Why use Linux?This is an issue most people ask. Why bother learning a totally different computing environment when operating systems that employment with completely different desktop environments, laptops, and servers work fine?To answer that question, I will be able to raise another question. Is that OS you’re currently working on? just okay ?? Or, does one end up battling obstacles like viruses, malware, slowdowns, crashes, costly repairs, and license fees?If you struggle with the above, then Linux could also be the proper platform for you. Linux has evolved into one of the foremost reliable computer ecosystems on the earth. Combine that reliability with zero cost of entry and you’ve got the proper solution for the desktop platform.Entry correct, zero cost … as in free. you’ll install Linux on multiple computers without paying a cent for a software or server license.Let’s take a glance at the value of Linux Server compared to Windows Server 2016. Windows Server 2016 Standard Edition is priced at $ 882.00 USD (purchased directly from Microsoft). This includes client access licenses (CALs) and licenses for other software that you simply may have to run (such as databases, web servers, mail servers, etc.). for instance, one user CAL for Windows Server 2016 costs $ 38.00. If you would like to feature 10 users, for instance, $ 388.00 more dollars for a server software license. With Linux Server, it’s all free and straightforward to put in. In fact, fixing a full-blown web server (which includes a database server) is simply a couple of clicks or commands (take a look; easy LAMP server installation? to urge a thought how simple it can be).If zero cost isn’t enough to win you over? As long as you employ it, what about an OS that will be trouble-free? I even have used Linux for nearly 20 years (as a desktop and server platform) and haven’t any problems with ransomware, malware, or viruses. Linux is usually less susceptible to such attacks. As for server reboots, they’re required only the kernel is updated. this is often not common for Linux servers for years without rebooting. If you often follow recommended updates, stability and dependability are practically assured.Open-sourceLinux is additionally distributed under an open-source license. Open source follows these major tenants:Freedom to run programs for any purpose.Freedom to review how the program works, and to try to what you would like to vary it.Freedom to redistribute copies in order that you’ll help your neighbor.Freedom to distribute copies of its revised editions to others.These points are important for understanding the community working together to create Linux platforms. Without a doubt, Linux is an OS intended for people by people? These tenants also are a main think about what percentage people choose Linux. it’s about freedom and freedom of use and freedom of choice.What is “distribution?”?Linux has many various versions for any sort of user. From new users to hard-core users, you will get a “taste” of Linux to match your needs. These versions are called distributions (or, for short, “distros”). Almost every distribution of Linux is often downloaded for free of charge, burned to disk (or USB thumb drive), and installed (on as many machines as you want).Popular Linux distributions include:image source:guru99Each distribution has a different take on the desktop. Some opt for very modern user interfaces (such as GNOME and Elementary OS’s Pantheon), whereas others stick with a more traditional desktop environment (openSUSE uses KDE).You can check out the top 100 distributions on the.And don’t think the server has been left behind. For this arena, you can turn to:Red Hat Enterprise LinuxUbuntu ServerCentosSUSE Enterprise LinuxSome of the above server distributions are free (such as Ubuntu Server and CentOS) and some have an associated price (such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Enterprise Linux). Those with an associated price also include support.Installing LinuxLet’s look at the various methods we can use to install Ubuntu.Installing Linux using a USB stickThis is one of the easiest methods of installing Ubuntu or any distribution on your computer. Follow the stepsimage source:guru99Step 1) Download the .iso or the OS files on your computer from this link.image source:guru99Step 2) Download free software like ‘Universal USB installer’ to make a bootable USB stick.image source:guru99Step 3) Select an Ubuntu Distribution form the dropdown to put on your USBSelect your Ubuntu iso file download in step 1.Select the drive letter of USB to install Ubuntu and Press the create button.image source:guru99Step 4) Click YES to Install Ubuntu in USB.image source:guru99Step 5) After everything has been installed and configured, a small window will appear Congratulations! You now have Ubuntu on a USB stick, bootable and ready to go.image source:guru99Basic Linux commandsimage source:guru99What is Git?Git is an open-source distributed version system. it’s designed to handle minor to major projects with high speed and efficiency. it’s developed to co-ordinate the work among the developers. The version control allows us to trace and work alongside our team members at an equivalent workspace.Git is the foundation of the many services like GitHub and GitLab, but we will use Git without using the other Git services. Git is often used privately and publicly.Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to develop Linux Kernel. it’s also used as a crucial distributed version-control tool for the DevOps.Features of Gitimage source:javatpoint• Open SourceGit is an open-source tool. it’s released under the GPL (General Public License) license.• ScalableGit is scalable, which suggests when the amount of users increases, the Git can easily handle such situations.• DistributedOne of Git’s great features is that it’s distributed. Distributed means rather than switching the project to a different machine, we will create a “clone” of the whole repository. Also, rather than just having one central repository that you simply send changes to, every user has their own repository that contains the whole commit history of the project. We don’t get to hook up with the remote repository; the change is simply stored on our local repository. If necessary, we will push these changes to a foreign repository.SecurityGit is secure. It uses the SHA1 (Secure Hash Function) to call and identify objects within its repository. Files and commits are checked and retrieved by its checksum at the time of checkout. It stores its history in such how that the ID of particular commits depends upon the entire development history leading up thereto commit. Once it’s published, one cannot make changes to its old version.• SpeedGit is extremely fast, so it can complete all the tasks for a while. Most of the git operations are done on the local repository, so it provides an enormous speed. Also, a centralized version system continually communicates with a server somewhere. Performance tests conducted by Mozilla showed that it had been extremely fast compared to other VCSs. Fetching version history from a locally stored repository is far faster than fetching it from the remote server. The core part of Git is written in C, which ignores runtime overheads related to other high-level languages.Git was developed to figure on the Linux kernel; therefore, it’s capable enough to handle large repositories effectively. From the start, speed and performance are Git’s primary goals.Why Git?We have discussed many features and benefits of Git that demonstrate the undoubtedly Git as the leading version control system. Now, we will discuss some other points about why should we choose Git.image source:javatpointGit IntegrityGit is developed to make sure the safety and integrity of content being version controlled. It uses checksum during transit or tampering with the filing system to verify that information isn’t lost. Internally it creates a checksum value from the contents of the file then verifies it when transmitting or storing data.• Trendy Version system Git is the most generally used version system. it’s maximum projects among all the version control systems. thanks to its amazing workflow and features, it’s a preferred choice of developers.• Everything is LocalAlmost All operations of Git are often performed locally; this is often a big reason for the utilization of Git. we’ll not need to ensure internet connectivity.• Collaborate to Public ProjectsThere are many public projects available on the GitHub. we will collaborate on those projects and show our creativity to the planet. Many developers are collaborating on public projects. The collaboration allows us to face experienced developers and learn tons from them; thus, it takes our programming skills to the subsequent level.Benefits of GitHubimage source:javatpointGitHub is often separated because of the Git and therefore the Hub. GitHub service includes access controls also as collaboration features like task management, repository hosting, and team management.The key benefits of GitHub are as follows. • it’s easy to contribute to open source projects via GitHub. • It helps to make a superb document. • you’ll attract recruiters by showing off your work. If you’ve got a profile on GitHub, you’ll have a better chance of being recruited. • It allows your work to urge out there ahead of the general public. • you’ll track changes in your code across versions.Basic command of Gitimage source:rebellabHow to build your own google drive?source:crio.doStep 1install inotifywaitcommand sudo apt-get install -y inotify-toolsStep 2create a file bycommand touch filename.shStep 3edit file by commandnano filename.shscript codepress ctrl+x then press yEnterStep 4Run the file by command./filename.shReferencesguru99linuxjavatpointconclusionIf you want to learn anything try to practice and developed something for the world you will never lose you have learned.

Object-Oriented JavaScript — Tagged Literals and Booleans,https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/object-oriented-javascript-tagged-literals-and-booleans-bed40840d71?source=tag_archive---------11-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Brett Jordan on UnsplashJavaScript is partly an object-oriented language.To learn JavaScript, we got to learn the object-oriented parts of JavaScript.In this article, we’ll look at strings and booleans, which are the building blocks of objects.Tagged Template LiteralsTagged template literals is another type of string literals.They let modify the output of template literals with a function.The function is called by prefix the template literal with the function.For instance, we can write:function transform(strings, ...substitutes) {  console.log(strings);  console.log(substitutes);}const firstname = ""James"";const lastname = ""Bond""transform `Name is ${firstname} ${lastname}`;transform is the template tag, which is a function that takes a specific set of parameters.strings is an array of the parts of a string that aren’t in the curly braces.substitutes have the values that are in the curly braces.So strings is:[""Name is "", "" "", """"]and substitutes is”[""James"", ""Bond""]BooleansBooleans can only take on one of 2 values.It can either be true or false .For instance, if we have:let b = true;Then:typeof b;returns 'boolean' .If we put true or false in quotes, then they’re strings.So if we have:var b = ""true"";typeof b;Then typeof b is 'string' .Logical Operators3 operators work with boolean values.The ! is the logical NOT operator.&& is the logical AND operator.And || is the logical OR operator.The ! negates the boolean value. So if we have:let b = !true;Then b is false .If we use logical NOT twice, then we get the original value. If we have:let b = !!true;then b is true .If a logical operator is used on a non-boolean value, then the value is converted to a boolean.If we have:let b = ""foo"";Then !b; is false .And if we have double negation:let b = ""one"";!!b;then we get true .Most values are converted to true with the double negation operator except the following:The empty string “”nullundefined0NaNfalseThe values above are all falsy.The && operator returnstrue when both operands are true . Otherwise, it returns false .The || operator returns true when either of the operands are true . Otherwise, it returns false .We can use more than one operator in sequence.For instance, we can write:true && true && false && true;and we get false .And:false || true || false;and we get true .If we mix || and && in one expression, then we should add parentheses.For instance, we can write:false && (false || true) && true;we get false .Operator PrecedenceOperators have precedence.The arithmetic follows the same rules as in math.So if we have:1 + 2 * 3;we get 7 because multiplication comes first.For logical operators, ! has the highest precedence and it’s run first.Then comes && and || .So:false && false || true && true;is the same as:(false && false) || (true && true);Photo by Mnz on UnsplashConclusionWe should be aware of operator precedence with operators.Also, there are several operators we should be aware of.JavaScript In Plain EnglishEnjoyed this article?

Get Acquainted With React Hooks in 15 Minutes,https://medium.com/swlh/get-acquainted-with-react-hooks-in-15-minutes-a64bb6d807c7?source=tag_archive---------12-----------------------,"React,React Hook,Web Development","PrimerAnyone who has written a class component in a large project knows that component life-cycle methods can get bloated. Code in componentDidMount and componentWillUnmount gets tangled amongst other blocks of unrelated code. Hooks provide a way to write modular and stateful components that is easy to test and reuse.The learning curve for hooks is steep. To help with the transition, I’ll be focusing on useState and useEffect. As a consequence, the performance of your application won’t be ideal. However, wrapping your mind around hooks becomes a much simpler feat. In future posts, I’ll discuss the more advanced hooks and how they help with performance.A couple of quick notesHooks can only exist inside functional components or inside other hooks.Functional components do not have life cycle events like class components. This is intentional. useEffect can be used to simulate a few life cycle events. We will explore this in a later post.Let’s get started.useStateThe most basic hook is useState. It takes an initialization value and returns a reference to the current value as well as a function to update that value. Let's create a state that keeps track of a counter;const [ count, setCount ] = useState(0);You can provide an initialization function instead of a starting value if you wish;const [ count, setCount ] = useState(() => {  const startingCount = 0;  ... // some logic  return startingCount;);When a functional component is re-rendered it does not re-initialize. Instead, React returns the cached value and update function. So all future renders after the first ignores initialization.You can have as many useState s’ as you want to keep track of any number of values.const [ count, setCount ] = useState(0);const [ anotherCount, setAnotherCount ] = useState(10);const [ message, setMessage ] = useState(""Default message"");const [ expanded, setExpanded ] = useState(false);useState in actionLet’s make a simple counter that displays a value along with two buttons; A button that adds one to the value and a button to subtract one. The function we’ll pass to the add button’s onClick will look like:const onPlus = () => {  setCount(count + 1);};The minus button’s onClick:const onMinus = () => {  setCount(count - 1);};Put it all together:function Counter() {  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);  const onPlus = () => {    setCount(count + 1);  };  const onMinus = () => {    setCount(count - 1);  };  return (    <div>      <button onClick={onPlus}>Plus</button>      <button onClick={onMinus}>Minus</button>      <div>{count}</div>    </div>  );}Here is a sandbox with a slight alteration of initializing on with a passed-in property to demonstrate that re-renders do not re-run initialization.Try the following:Add another button that resets the counter.useEffectThis hook allows you to perform side effects inside of functional components. It takes a function followed by an optional dependency array. The side effect only re-runs if one or more dependencies change.useEffect(someFunction, dependencyArray);useEffect in actionLet’s take our previous ‘counter’ example and modify it so it changes the color of the count label to the following;Red; if the count is negative.Black; if the count is 0.Green; if the count is positive.Create a new useState that will store the current label color. We’ll use hex values in this example. To re-run our side-effect that updates our state color, we need to put count in the dependency array.const [count, setCount] = useState(startingCount);const [countLabelColor, setCountLabelColor] = useState(""#000000"");useEffect(() => {  if (count < 0) {    setCountLabelColor(""#ff0000""); // red  } else if (count === 0) {    setCountLabelColor(""#000000""); // black  } else {    setCountLabelColor(""#00ff00""); // green  }}, [count]);Here is a sandbox with a working example;Wrap-upThat’s it! With useState and useEffect you are well on your way to learning hooks. Most things you would want to accomplish can be done with these two hooks. There are concerns about performance if you only stick to these two hooks. For example; the useEffect sandbox above is rendering more than once every time a button gets clicked. This isn’t an issue at this scale but as components get more complex and applications get larger, the consequences become clearer. For now, master these two hooks before moving on to the more advanced ones.As with anything, keep practicing, and good luck!The StartupMedium's largest active publication, followed by +723K people.

Functional JavaScript — Benefits,https://levelup.gitconnected.com/functional-javascript-benefits-bdc61cc0925?source=tag_archive---------14-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Max Böhme on UnsplashIn this article, we’ll look at how to use the functional programming features in JavaScript.Functional Programming BenefitsFunctional programming has various benefits.This is why it’s being adopted into programming languages like JavaScript.Pure FunctionsOne benefit of functional programming is that we define pure functions in our code.A pure function returns the same output if we pass in the same input to it.For instance, we can write:const square = (value) => value ** 2;We get the value and we return the square of it.This doesn’t change regardless of what happens outside.The benefit is that pure functions can easily be tested.We can just check the output after giving it some input.Since it doesn’t depend on anything outside, we can check for it easily.We can check the returned value by writing something like:square(2) === 4Reasonable CodeIt’s easy to read the code since the code for the function all reside inside the function.For example, if we have:const square = (value) => value ** 2;All we did is square the number which is passed in.There’s nothing outside, so we can look at it easily.Parallel CodeSince pure functions don’t depend on any values outside the function, we don’t have to worry about synchronize our function’s value with something outside.If we have global values, then we may have to do something like this:let global = ""something""let foo = (input) => {  global = ""somethingElse""}let bar = () => {  if (global === ""something"") {    //...  }}We’ve to check the value for the global variable before doing something.With pure function, we don’t have to do that since there are no external dependencies.CachablePure functions always return the same output for the given input.So we can cache the function outputs easily.We just use the input as the key and the output as the value.We can just look up the value from the cache.With caching, we can increase the speed of our code.For example, we can keep a cache with an object:const cache = {  1: 2,  3: 4,  //...}Then we can check or the cached value by writing:const value = cache.hasOwnProperty(input) ?  cache[input] :  cache[input] = longRunningFunction(input)We check for the cached value before we run the longRunningFunction .Pipelines and ComposableWe can compose pure functions easily.We just pass in the return value of one pure function to another pure function.For example, we can write:const foo = (a) => {  return a * 2;}const bar = (b) => {  return b * 3;}We can compose the functions by writing:foo(bar(100));It looks like a mathematical function and it’s a mathematical function.Photo by Markus Spiske on UnsplashConclusionFunctional programming has various benefits.We can run code in parallel easily since we don’t have to synchronous code.Also, we can compose functions easily.They’re also easier to read and test.Level Up CodingCoding tutorials and news.Follow97 ProgrammingWeb DevelopmentTechnologySoftware DevelopmentJavaScript97 claps97 clapsWritten byJohn Au-YeungFollowWeb developer.

"Async, Defer and Dynamic Scripts",https://medium.com/swlh/async-defer-and-dynamic-scripts-9a2c43a92be1?source=tag_archive---------15-----------------------,"Programming,JavaScript,HTML,Coding,Web Development","Photo by Daniel Tran on UnsplashNowadays scripts can be heavier than HTML and their download size is larger, and processing time is longer too.When the browser loads HTML and comes across a <script>...</script> tag, it can’t continue building the DOM. It must execute the script right now. The same happens for external scripts <script src=""...""></script>: the browser must wait until the script downloads, execute it, and only after process the rest of the page.But there can be some important issues such as:Scripts can’t see DOM elements below themIf there’s a bulky script at the top of the page, it “blocks the page”. Users can’t see the page content till it downloads and runs.We can solve this issue with placing script at the end (after html), but that solution will force the script to load after html loads. For long HTML documents, that may be a noticeable delay if people have slow internet.Luckily, there are two <script> attributes that solve the problem for us: defer and async.DeferWith defer attribute browser loads script in ‘background’ mode and runs it when it loads.So defer mode prevents blocking the page and scripts with defer always execute when the DOM is ready, but before DOMContentLoaded event.The DOMContentLoaded event fires when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading.Deferred scripts keep their relative order, just like regular scripts. So, if we have a long script first, and then a smaller one, then the latter one waits.But the defer attribute is ignored if the <script> tag has no src.AsyncThe async attribute means that it helps script to load in ‘independent’ mode.The browser loads pages without waiting for async scripts to load. DOMContentLoaded and async scripts don’t wait for each other (“load-first” order).Other scripts don’t wait for async scripts, and async scripts don’t wait for them. Async mode (like defer mode) doesn’t block the page.Async scripts are great when we integrate an independent third-party script into the page: counters, ads, analytic tools and so on, as they don’t depend on our scripts, and our scripts shouldn’t wait for them.DynamicWe can also add a script dynamically using JavaScript:The script starts loading as soon as it’s appended to the document and behaves as “async” scripts by default.It means:They don’t wait for anything, nothing waits for them.The script that loads first — runs first (“load-first” order).But we can turn off async mode for dynamic scripts by setting script.async = false before appending it to html.SummaryBoth async and defer have one common thing: downloading of such scripts doesn’t block page rendering. So the user can read page content and get acquainted with the page immediately.Thank you for reading. I hope you liked it 😎The StartupMedium's largest active publication, followed by +723K people.

"Maintainable JavaScript — Undefined, Arrays, and Objects",https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/maintainable-javascript-undefined-arrays-and-objects-58e46d7a79c9?source=tag_archive---------16-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Vivint Solar on UnsplashCreating maintainable JavaScript code is important if want to keep using the code.In this article, we’ll look at the basics of creating maintainable JavaScript code with some conventions for undefined .Undefinedundefined is a value that’s often confused with null .This is partly because null == undefined returns true .However, they’re actually very different from each other.Variables that haven’t been assigned a value have the initial value of undefined .This means it’s waiting for a real value to be assigned to it.If we have:let animal;console.log(animal === undefined);Then the console log will log true .undefined shouldn’t be used much in our code.But we need to check for them so that we’ll avoid all sorts of runtime errors.We often get things that are undefined .Non-existent properties have value undefined .Parameters that haven’t have an argument passed in for it is also undefined .If we try to do something to something that’s undefined , then we’ll get an error.Therefore, we need to check for them.To check for undefined , we can use the typeof operator.If something is undefined , typeof will return 'undefined' .For example, we can write:let animal;console.log(typeof animal);Then we get 'undefined’ logged.We shouldn’t use it for assignments, but we should check for them.Object LiteralsObject literals is a popular way to create objects with a set of properties.It’s shorter than using the Object constructor and does the same thing.Therefore, we should use the object literal notation to create an object.For example, instead of writing:let book = new Object();book.title = ""javascript for beginners"";book.author = ""jane smith"";We should write:let book = {  title: ""javascript for beginners"",  author: ""jane smith""}It’s shorter and cleaner.We just specify all the properties and values in between the curly braces.We include the opening curly brace in the first line.The properties are indented one level.And the closing brace is in its own line.Most style guides and linters suggest this format.Guides like the Google style guide, Airbnb, style guide, ESLint default rules, etc. all look for this style.Array LiteralsLike object literals, we don’t need the Array constructor to create arrays.Instead, we use the array literal notation.For instance, instead of writing:let fruits = new Array(""apple"", ""orange"", ""grape"");let numbers = new Array(1, 2, 3, 4);We write:let fruits = [""apple"", ""orange"", ""grape""];let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];It’s much shorter and does the same thing.It’s widely used and it’s common in JavaScript.The Array constructor also has 2 versions.It returns an array with the arguments if we pass in multiple arguments.If there’s only one argument and it’s a nonnegative integer, then it creates an array with the number of empty slots as indicated by the argument.Therefore, it’s another reason to avoid the Array constructor.Photo by Michael Dziedzic on UnsplashConclusionWe can work with undefined , objects and arrays in better ways.Literals are better than constructors for arrays and objects.JavaScript In Plain EnglishEnjoyed this article?

Functional JavaScript — Creating Functions,https://medium.com/@hohanga/functional-javascript-creating-functions-46f0ab572df2?source=tag_archive---------17-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Obi Onyeador on UnsplashJavaScript is partly a functional language.To learn JavaScript, we got to learn the functional parts of JavaScript.In this article, we’ll look at how to use the functional programming features in JavaScript.Pure Function Is a Mathematical FunctionPure functions are mathematical functions.They exhibit all the same characteristics.Given the same input, then return one output.JavaScript and Functional ProgrammingJavaScript is partly a functional programming language.It has some of the features, but it also allows us to program it in a non-functional way.For instance, we can create a function in JavaScript that takes no arguments.But functions are treated as first-class citizens.So we can have higher-order functions.JavaScript FunctionsWe can create a simple JavaScript function by writing:() => ""foo""We created an arrow function, which is available only in ES6.We can assign it to a variable by writing:const foo = () => ""foo"";Then we can call the function by writing:foo()Strict ModeJavaScript has a strict mode to let us write better JavaScript code.To enable strict mode, we can add the 'use strict' directive to add the make the code below it use strict mode.For example, we can write:""use strict"";const bar = function bar() {  return ""bar"";};to enable strict mode.It’ll stop us from writing bad code like creating global variables accidentally:""use strict"";global = 'bad';Multiple Statement FunctionsWe can write functions with multiple statements.For instance, we can write:const simpleFn = () => {  let value = ""abc""  return value;}We have an assignment statement and a return statement to return the value.Function ArgumentsFunctions can take arguments.For example, we can write:const identity = (value) => valueIt takes a value and returns it.ES5 functions are valid in ES6.But it doesn’t work the other way around.So we can’t use arrow functions in an ES5 only environment.Functional Alternatives to LoopsWe can rewrite loops in a functional way by abstracting out the loop body into its own function.For example, instead of writing:const array = [1, 2, 3];for (const a of arr) {  console.log(a);}We can write:const forEach = (array, fn) => {  for (const a of arr) {    fn(a)  }}Our forEach function has an array and fn parameters.We loop through the array and call our function.This way, we can abstract out our logic to the outside and pass it in.If we use const , then we can’t assign a new value to forEach accidentally.Photo by Dogancan Ozturan on UnsplashConclusionWe can create functions to a functional way by creating functions that don’t reference things from the outside.Also, we can abstract out logic into their own functions and pass them in.Written byJohn Au-YeungWeb developer.

Best of Modern JavaScript — Object-Oriented Programming,https://medium.com/dev-genius/best-of-modern-javascript-object-oriented-programming-78984bd3f937?source=tag_archive---------18-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Adam Griffith on UnsplashSince 2015, JavaScript has improved immensely.It’s much more pleasant to use it now than ever.In this article, we’ll look at the core features of JavaScript.No More apply()Before ES6, we’ve to use apply to call a function with an array spread as arguments.With ES6 or later, we can use the spread operator instead of calling a function.It’s easier since we don’t have to set the value of this .For instance, instead of writing:Math.max.apply(Math, [3, 2, 1, 6])We write:Math.max(...[3, 2, 1, 6])It’s much easier and we don’t have to worry about an extra argument.With the push method, we can push multiple items with the apply method with ES5 or later:var arr1 = [1, 2];var arr2 = [3, 4];arr1.push.apply(arr1, arr2);The first argument is the array instance, which we set as the value of this .With ES6, we can instead write:const arr1 = [1, 2];const arr2 = [3, 4];arr1.push(...arr2);With the spread operator, we don’t have to do that anymore.concat() can be Replace by SpreadWe can replace concat with the spread operator with ES6.Instead of writing in ES5:var arr1 = [1, 2];var arr2 = [3, 4];var arr3 = [5, 6];console.log(arr1.concat(arr2, arr3));We write:const arr1 = [1, 2];const arr2 = [3, 4];const arr3 = [5, 6];console.log([...arr1, ...arr2, ...arr3]));We merged all 3 arrays together into with the spread operator with ES6 or later.Both expressions return a new array with elements of all 3 arrays in it.Function Expressions in Object LiteralsWe don’t to write out the function keyword for object methods anymore with ES6 or later.It has a handy syntax for defining methods in objects.In ES5 or earlier, we’ve to write:var obj = {  eat: function() {    //...  },  drink: function() {    this.eat();  },}to define methods in an object.With ES6 or later, we can shorten it to:const obj = {  eat() {    //...  },  drink() {    this.eat();  },}We removed the function keyword and colon so it’s much shorter.They do the same thing.Constructors to ClassesES6 provides us with a handy class syntax to create constructor functions.In ES5, we’ve to write:function Person(name) {  this.name = name;}Person.prototype.greet = function() {  return 'Hello ' + this.name;};Instance methods are defined by adding a property to the prototype property.In ES6, we can use the class syntax by writing:class Person {  constructor(name) {    this.name = name;  }  greet() {    return `Hello ${this.name}`;  }}The constructor has what’s inside the constructor function.And greet is still the method in Person ‘s prototype property.It’s just written differently.SubclassesCreating subclasses is complicated with ES5. If we have super constructors and properties, it’s even harder.To create a parent and child class with ES5 or earlier, we write:function Person(name) {  this.name = name;}Person.prototype.greet = function() {  return 'Hello ' + this.name;};function Student(name, number) {  Person.call(this, name);  this.number = number;}Student.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype);Student.prototype.constructor = Student;Student.prototype.describe = function() {  return Person.prototype.greet.call(this) + '-' + this.number;};We create the Person constructor the same way.Then to create the Student subclass, we call the Person constructor with the call method with this and name to call the parent constructor.Then we initialize the instance data of Student .And then we create the prototype of Student by calling Object.create with Person ‘s prototype.Then we set the constructor property to Student to get the right constructor.Then we add our instance methods to the Student class.It’s complex and hard to understand.With the class syntax, we write:class Person {  constructor(name) {    this.name = name;  }  greet() {    return `Hello ${this.name}`;  }}class Student extends Person {  constructor(name, number) {    super(name);    this.number = number;  }  describe() {    return `${Person.prototype.greet.call(this)}-'${this.number}`;  }}All we had to do us to use the extends keyword to indicate that it’s a subclass.And we call super to call the parent constructor.Photo by Celine Sayuri Tagami on UnsplashConclusionObject-oriented programming is easier with ES6 or later.Dev GeniusCoding, Tutorials, News, UX, UI and much more related to developmentFollow80 Sign up for Best StoriesBy Dev GeniusThe best stories sent monthly to your email. Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

Real time collaborative editing in your web application,https://medium.com/@self.adi/real-time-collaborative-editing-in-your-web-application-a2af6baa72ca?source=tag_archive---------19-----------------------,"Collaboration,Web Development,Real Time Editing,Open Source","I am writing this article in the time when most of us are working remotely and we all are doing collaborative work in one way or another.This article is about various options that can be used in your web application to integrate real time collaboration.“Coming together is a beginning. Keeping together is progress. Working together is success.” -Henry FordThere are various ways to achieve real time collaboration, in this article I will be covering only open source projects, their pros and cons in brief.1. Quillhttps://quilljs.com/Collaboration in quill-1. The simplest approach for real time collaboration in quill is to Wave. It is not open source though and it’s paid. So if you want a very clean user interface with minimal coding (and trusting a third party over you data) you can go straight away for this approach.2. The another approach is using an open source project quill-sharedb-cursors. It runs on node and uses mongodb as database.The deployment is very simple but customization is not. You have to get your hands dirty on the node project if you want to customize it your way.Further if you are comfortable with MongoDB you are all set to use this.2. ProseMirrorhttps://prosemirror.net/It is another strong rich text editor.Collaboration in prosemirror-There is no documentation available for collaborative editing on their official website, however they have given a playground and a link to github code.For setting up and customization you have to write some(`some` can be `many` if you compare with quill or any other editor) lines of code.Also if you are using Vue.js there is a renderless editor tiptap which is written on prosemirror itself. You can explore that more and it supports real-time collaboration.3. Etherpadhttps://etherpad.org/Etherpad is highly customizable web based real time editor.It runs on a node server and can be configured with your MySQL database.The setup is very easy and it provides a lot of options for customization.It also provides-1. HTTP API -You can perform various actions using the API calls, also it has various API clients in different languages but they are not customizable (I checked the python client) so it’s better to write your own.2. Plugins -There are various plugins available for customizing your etherpad.Installation is very simple and most of them don’t require any settings.PS: I will be writing a separate article on integration of etherpad editor with your project.4. TogetherJShttps://togetherjs.com/TogetherJS seems to provide a very promising solution for collaboration, but it’s not production ready (I am saying this because there are a lot of open issues, not maintained and the demo examples given on home page doesn’t work)It was developed by Mozilla labs and now maintained by jsfiddle.It’s implementation is easy. You have to host your own server (you can’t rely on theirs, it is down most of the times) and include the JS in your script tag and you are all set to go.It provides chat option by default (which is the only thing that works).Also it’s not consistent for elements, sometimes you may see it working, sometimes it doesn’t.5. Onlyofficehttps://www.onlyoffice.com/en/It is a very powerful project alternative to google docs,sheet etc.The best part is that Docker installation is available and you can host in on your own server.For collaboration you can use their API.Written byAditya SinghI love to develop - softwares, apps and myself!Follow131 1 131 131 1 CollaborationWeb DevelopmentReal Time EditingOpen SourceMore from Aditya SinghFollowI love to develop - softwares, apps and myself!More From MediumTips For Landing Your First Software Engineering JobAdi S in JavaScript In Plain English3 Ways to Create React ComponentsAdham El BanhawyJavaScript Function ChainingMayank Gupta in TechnoFunnelRest Parameter and Spread OperatorEnrico Gruner in The StartupTop 10 Github Apps on Marketplace to Use as Junior JavaScript Developers in 2020Jay Chow in JavaScript In Plain EnglishUnderstand JavaScript’s Generators in 3 MinutesDylan Kerler in The StartupTrying Out the Promise.allSettled CombinatorRayhan Sattar in Better ProgrammingAdd Authentication to Your App With BCrypt and JWTMadeline Corman in Better ProgrammingAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
How to render your website,https://medium.com/codechem/how-to-render-your-website-70a18228eab9?source=tag_archive---------20-----------------------,"Web Development,Server Side Rendering,Client Side Rendering,Nextjs","Originally published at nikolovlazar.comA little historyBack in the days, rendering a website was simple. You needed a web server that served HTML files. Those were static sites. Then developers started using databases and authentication. To achieve that, they needed to manipulate the HTML file before serving it. That’s how server-side rendering was born. Let’s fast forward until 2010, when Backbone got released. The front-end got richer and more complex. Then the era of client-side applications begin. Developers migrated their data and routing logic to the client side. They could, because Google “understood” JavaScript. The servers became slimmer, but the websites became more complex. Yet, recently server-side rendering became a trend again. All thanks to React and its server-side hydration feature.Static sitesStatic sites are the simplest way to render a website. You code your website in HTML/CSS, and serve those files from a web server. This is the simplest way to render your website, but it comes with pros and cons.Static Site DiagramConsSince they’re static, you cannot have dynamic data. To update the data on your static site, you need to edit your HTML files, and deploy them again.That also means that your visitors won’t be able to “contribute” to the website data. They can’t leave comments, or create their own posts, or “like” your content.ProsBut, since there’s no “computation” in static sites, they are the fastest to render. The server serves the HTML file, and the browser starts “drawing” immediately. This gives your website fast TTFB (time-to-first-byte) score.Another benefit that static sites have is the ability to host them on CDNs. A CDN (content delivery network) is a network of servers distributed around the world. Meaning, your website will “live” on many servers at the same time. Also, CDNs are cheaper than dedicated servers!They’re also more secure. There is no back-end. That means there’s less room for your site to suffer an attack, or your database to get compromised.So, if you need to create a website that doesn’t update the data on a regular basis, static site might be the best for you. Your site will be fast, cheap, and more secure.Client-side renderingClient-side apps are like static sites, but they use JavaScript to fetch their data. The server serves an HTML file with JavaScript inside, and the browser starts executing. This method also gives you a fast TTFB score, but the TTI (time to interactive) is slow, since there’s no data right away.Client-side Rendering DiagramConsThe TTI in this case depends on the user’s internet speed and the amount of data requests. So, you need to be very careful when to trigger your data requests. But, there’s nothing you can do about the user’s internet speed.Also, different browsers have different support for scripts. This means that you need to invest more into testing your CSA.If a user decides to disable JavaScript, your website would be blank.To fetch the data, you will need an API. That’s an extra responsibility. When building APIs, you also need to think about security and data access. If you leave your API routes open without authentication, someone can make a mess.ProsYou have dynamic data! You won’t need to edit files to update your website. Also, your website can be interactive. With dynamic data, you can make forums, social networks, tools, and all kinds of platforms.You can implement authentication. With that, each user can have a personalized experience on your website.Client-side apps can be SPAs (single page applications). That means the routing is completely on the client side, and it’s instant! Because users don’t have to wait for the server to respond when navigating between your pages.Server-side renderingServer-side rendering is an old and mature way of rendering the websites. There are tons of tools to help you achieve SSR. It’s like CSR, but the data and routing logic lives on the server. When requesting a page, the server fetches the data and inlines it in the HTML file. That file is then served to the user, and the browser starts rendering right away.Server-side Rendering DiagramConsThe TTFB is slower. The browser needs to wait for the server to fetch the data and prepare the HTML for your page.The server will also be busier. It needs to visit the database and prepare the HTML file every time a user navigates between your pages.When navigating between pages a full page reload needs to happen.ProsSSR websites are SEO friendly! The search engines can get and index your data without executing extra scripts. Also, they can get the localized version, so you have better SEO for your supported languages.The content gets served faster. This is because usually the servers have better internet connection than the users. Also, servers are more performant than the users’ machine.The user’s machine is less busy. The browser only needs to take care of rendering, not data fetching and executing scripts.The SSR method can also fix the issues with social sharing and the OpenGraph system.You also have dynamic data. Every time the user lands on your page, the server fetches and serves the freshest data.Bonus: Incremental Static RegenerationThis method gets the static site speed of rendering and the server-side data fetching. This is what Next JS introduced in version 9.5. So ISR “builds” the static HTML files on build time, but then it rebuilds them every time there’s traffic on the site. The rebuilding happens in the background. That means the users are immediately presented with a static HTML file. If the data changes, the server rebuilds that page and starts serving the new version from there on.ConsThe server has less load than SSR, but more load than CSA or Static. But you can configure this. The server rebuilds the page after a user requests it and there’s new data. That happens on configurable intervals. You can tell the server to revalidate the page on X seconds. So, if you expect frequent data changes set the revalidation interval to a smaller value. If not, you can set the revalidation interval to be, for example, once per day.ProsWell, you have dynamic data which gets served in a static way. You have fast TTFB score, but also fast TTI.Because it’s static, you get great SEO our of the box.Next JS has a fallback mechanism for dynamic pages. Let’s say you have a blog that’s using the ISR method. Your posts route would be something like /posts/[post-slug]. When you write a new post and publish it, you will only need to open the URL and Next JS will render that post page static. When you open that post again, it will be served immediately.There’s no full page reload when navigating between pages. Next JS prefetches the data for the pages that can be accessed from the current page.ConclusionThe web development world has seen a significant change, and it will keep changing. In this post we got introduced to 4 methods of rendering websites. We explored the pros and cons and now have a good understanding of them. But, there is no holy grail. If you need to develop a very simple website, SSR or CSA will be an overkill, so you can use Static. If you need to develop a blog platform, or a forum, then SSR or CSA will be your best friend. Before deciding which method to use, write down the things that you need to have. Should your site have great SEO? Or dynamic data is the most important factor? Do you need to serve the website on a CDN? This list will help you choose the most suitable method.If you liked this article feel free to share it so more people can learn from it.Code ChemistryGive us a problem and we will develop a solutionFollow37 Web DevelopmentServer Side RenderingClient Side RenderingNextjs37 claps37 clapsWritten byLazar NikolovFollowFull-stack engineer | UX/UI Designer.

Functional JavaScript — The Basics,https://medium.com/@hohanga/functional-javascript-the-basics-cccc7932374f?source=tag_archive---------21-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Tijana Drndarski on UnsplashJavaScript is partly a functional language.To learn JavaScript, we got to learn the functional parts of JavaScript.In this article, we’ll look at how to use the functional programming features in JavaScript.What Is Functional Programming?Functional programming is the use of various principles in our app’s code.The most basic principle is that we abstract out the how part into reusable code.And we create functions that don’t depend on the outside.Also, if the function have the same input, we get the same output.Functions are mathematical functions.They take arguments and return values.The arguments we pass in will always create the same output if the arguments are the same.Also, they don’t interact with the outside world.For instance, we can have a function like:const calculateTax = (value, percentValue) => {  return value / 100 * (100 +    percentValue)}It takes some arguments and doesn’t reference anything outside in the function body.This is called a pure function.A pure function is a function that doesn’t reference anything outside.And if we give it the same inputs, it’ll always give the same outputs.JavaScript Functions vs MethodsA function is a piece of code that can be called by its name.It can pass arguments and return values.A method is a piece of code that may be called by its name with its associated object name.So a function is something like:const foo = (a) => {  return a}And a method is something like:const obj = {  foo: (a) => {    return a  }}We call the method by writing:obj.foo(1)Referential TransparencyFunctions return the same output for the same input.This property is called referential transparency.If we have referential transparent, then we can infer the return value from the function call.So if we have:const sameVal = (i) => {  return i}and:sum(4,5) + sameVal(1)We can infer that the expression above is the same as:sum(4,5) + 1The substitution model lets us substitute the direct result of a function.This leads to parallel code and caching since they don’t depend on anything outside.All they depend on is their argument.Imperative, Declarative, AbstractionFunctional programming is about being declarative and writing abstracted code.Declarative code means we tell the computer what the compiler needs to do rather than how to do it.The how part is abstracted into higher-order functions.Higher-order functions are fuincti8ons that take functions as arguments or return functions.For example, the array instance forEach method takes a callback and then log an element.We can iterate through an array with it by writing:const array = [1, 2, 3];array.forEach((a) => console.log(a))Photo by Maxwell Nelson on UnsplashConclusionFunctional programming follows some basic principles.We create functions that don’t depend on the outside and if we give them the same inputs, we always get the same outputs.Written byJohn Au-YeungWeb developer.

"React vs Angular, who is better?",https://medium.com/@sajjadhussain-11869/react-vs-angular-who-is-better-23c9b80516ba?source=tag_archive---------22-----------------------,"React,Angular,Programming,Web Development,Web Design","In the field of programming, Angular and React are currently the two most popular Java frameworks for front-end developers.Whether in terms of popularity, architectural similarity, or from a Java-based perspective, these two front-end frameworks have many similarities.In this article, we will make an in-depth comparison between React and Angular. We will start with the basic characteristics of the two frameworks.A brief introduction to Angular and React.jsAngularAngular is a front-end framework supported by Google. It is compatible with most commonly used code editors. It is part of the MEAN stack.The MEAN stack is a free and open source, Java-centric tool set that can be used to build dynamic websites and web applications.Its components include: MongoDB (NoSQL database), Express.js (Web application framework), Angular or AngularJS (front-end framework), and Node.js (server platform).The Angular framework allows developers to create dynamic single-page Web applications (Single-Page Web Applications, SPA).The original version of Angular solved the problem of converting HTML-based documents into dynamic content.Here, we will focus on its newer version, Angular 2+, and the difference between it and AngularJS.In industry cases, Angular is mainly used by Forbes, WhatsApp, Instagram, healthcare.gov, HBO, Nike and other organizations.React.jsReact.js is an open source Java library created by Facebook in 2011 to build dynamic user interfaces.React is based on Java and JSX, and JSX is a PHP extension developed by Facebook that can create reusable HTML elements for front-end development. React has an independent cross-platform framework React Native that can be used for mobile development.In industry cases, React is mainly used by organizations such as Netflix, PayPal, Uber, Twitter, Udemy, Reddit, Airbnb, and Walmart.Tool set Framework vs LibraryReaders with development experience know that the framework ecosystem defines the seam less of the engineering experience. Next, let’s take a look at the main features of Angular and React.First of all, React is not a real framework, it is actually a library. Therefore, it requires multiple integrations with other tools and libraries.In contrast, when using Angular, you already have all the conditions for building an application.Angular provides the following out of the box functions:RxJS: It is an asynchronous library that reduces resource consumption by setting up multiple data exchange channels. The main advantage of RxJS is that it can handle events independently and synchronously. However, the accompanying problem is: Although RxJS can work with many frameworks, you must learn about the library to make the most of Angular.Angular CLI: With a powerful command-line interface, it can assist in creating applications, adding files, testing, debugging, and deployment.Dependency injection: This framework separates various components from their dependencies and makes them run synchronously; at the same time, they can also change dependencies without reconfiguring components.Ivy renderer: As a new generation of Angular rendering engine, Ivy’s performance has been significantly improved.Angular Universal: It is a technology used for server-side rendering. It can quickly render the first application page or display the application on a browser-side device (such as a mobile device) that may lack rendering resources.Aptana, WebStorm, Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code: are common code editors for Angular.Jasmine, Karma, and Protractor: All are tools for end-to-end testing and debugging in the browser.React requires multiple integrations and various support tools to run:Redux: It is a state container that can accelerate the running of React in large applications, manage application components with a variety of dynamic elements, and can also be used for rendering. In addition, React uses a broader set of Redux tools, including: Reselect, Redux’s selector library, and Redux DevTools Profiler Monitor.Babel: It is a conversion compiler that can convert JSX into a Java application that can be understood by the browser.Webpack: Since all the components are written in different files, we need to bundle them together for better management. And Webpack is a recognized standard code bundler.React Router: This router is a standard URL routing library often used by React.Similar to Angular: You are not limited in terms of code choice. Its common editors include Visual Studio Code, Atom and Sublime Text.The difference with Angular is that in React, you cannot use a single tool to test the entire application, but you must use different tools for different types of tests.The following is a list of how React works with various tools:Enzyme and Unexpected-react are used for component testing.Jest is used for Java code.react-testing-library is used for React DOM testing.React-unit is used for unit testing.Skin-deep is used for rendering tests.The Chrome Extension and Firefox Extension of React Developer Tools, and React Sight can also visually display the status and prop tree.Both of these tools form a strong ecosystem. Under normal circumstances, users tend to choose React, but React needs a variety of integrations such as Redux to expand its service capabilities.Component-based architecture: reusable and maintainable components of two toolsBoth frameworks have a component-based architecture. This means that a single application can build a variety of user interfaces through modular, cohesive, and reusable components.In Web development, component-based architecture is generally considered easier to maintain than using other structures.It speeds up the development process by creating separate components, and enables developers to shorten the time for products to go online, and to adjust and extend applications.①Code: Type vs Java (JSX)Angular uses the Type language (of course you can also use Java if needed).Type is a superset of Java suitable for large projects. It is both compact and able to recognize errors in input.Other advantages of Type include: better navigation and auto-completion, and faster code refactoring.In addition, Type’s scalability and simplicity are also very suitable for large-scale projects on an enterprise scale.React uses Java ES6 and JSX scripts. JSX is a syntax extension of Java that is used to simplify UI coding and make Java code look more like HTML. JSX can not only detect various errors, but also protect the code from injection attacks.In addition, Babel (https://babeljs.io/) uses JSX for browser compilation. Babel is a compiler that converts code into a format that can be read by a web browser.Although JSX can almost achieve similar functions to Type in terms of syntax, some developers still think it is more complicated and difficult to learn.②DOM: real vs virtualThe Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML, XHTML or XML documents.It has a tree-shaped organization structure that enables scripts to dynamically interact with the content and structure of Web documents and update them.There are two types of DOM: virtual and real. In terms of implementation principle, even if one element changes, the traditional or real DOM will update the entire tree structure.The virtual DOM is a mapping of the real DOM, so it only tracks the changed parts, only updates specific elements, and does not affect other parts of the entire tree.React uses a virtual DOM, while Angular runs on the real DOM and uses change detection to find components that need to be updated.Although virtual DOM is considered to be faster to operate than real DOM, in Angular, due to the need for change detection, these two methods are actually equivalent in terms of performance.③Data binding: two-way vs down (one-way)Data binding is the process of synchronizing data between the model (business logic) and the view (UI). There are two basic implementations of data binding: one-way and two-way. The difference between one-way and two-way data binding lies in the update process of the model view.Two-way data binding in Angular is similar to the “Model-View-Controller (MVC)” architecture,Since the model and view are synchronized, changes in data will affect the view, and changes in the view will in turn trigger corresponding changes in data.React uses one-way or downward data binding. The one-way data flow does not allow the child element to affect the parent element when it is updated, so it is guaranteed that only approved components will change.It can be seen that this type of data binding makes the code more stable, of course, it also requires additional work to synchronize the corresponding model and view. After all, it takes more time to update the configuration of the parent component triggered by the child component change.In general, React’s one-way data binding is more predictable, the code is more stable, and debugging is easier. The traditional two-way data binding in Angular is easy to use.④ Application size and performance: Angular is slightly betterAngularJS has lower performance when dealing with complex and dynamic applications. And because of the use of virtual DOM, the efficiency of various React applications is faster than AngularJS applications of the same size.In addition, the study also shows that: Angular’s application size is slightly smaller, the transfer size (Transfer Size) when tested is only 129 KB, while React + Redux has 193 KB.⑤Pre-built UI design elements: Angular Material vs community-supported componentsAngular: With the popularity of the Material Design language in web applications, more engineers benefit from its out-of-the-box material toolset.Angular has pre-built material design components. Its Angular Material can implement a series of common interaction models for form controls, navigation, layout, buttons, indicators, pop-up windows, modules, and data tables. Due to the existence of various pre-built elements, the speed of configuring the UI becomes faster.React: Most of its UI tools come from its community. Currently, the UI components section of the React portal (https://reactjs.org/community/ui-components.html) provides a large number of free and partially paid components.You need to install the Material-UI library and various dependencies to build using React’s material design.In addition, you may also use the Bootstrap components built by React (https://react-bootstrap.github.io/), and include UI components and toolsets (https://hackernoon.com/23-best-react- ui-component-libraries-and-frameworks-250a81b2ac42) other software packages.⑥Mobile portability: Native vs React NativeBoth of these frameworks come with tools that allow engineers to port existing Web applications to mobile applications.We also conducted an in-depth analysis and comparison of Native (Angular) and React Native.Here is a brief summary of the main points: Native (https://www.native.org/) is a cross-platform mobile framework that uses Type as the core language. Its user interface is built with XML and CSS.When developers migrate business logic from a web application and use the same operating skills on its UI, the tool allows iOS and Android platforms to share approximately 90% of the code.The idea behind Native is to write a single UI for mobile devices and fine-tune each platform according to specific needs.Different from the hybrid cross-platform solution that uses WebView to render, the framework runs various applications in the Java virtual machine and directly connects to the native mobile API, thus ensuring high performance comparable to native applications .React Native (https://facebook.github.io/react-native/): This Java framework is prepared for the cross-platform implementation of mobile applications and can support porting from the Web.Compared with Native, React Native takes a slightly different approach: It encourages its community to write separate UIs for different platforms and adheres to the “learn once, write everywhere” approach.Therefore, the degree of code sharing is 70%. In addition, React Native also has native API rendering capabilities similar to Native.However, it needs to build an additional bridge API layer and use native controllers to connect to Java runtime.In general, if you need to use the same business logic to run web and mobile applications at the same time, then these two frameworks are good choices.Of course, Native is more focused on code sharing and shortening the product launch time; while React Native will use a longer development cycle in exchange for a closer native look and feel.⑦Documentation and vendor support: insufficient documentation, relying on large communitiesSince January 2018, as Google continues to develop the Angular ecosystem, they can not only provide long-term support (Long-Term Support, LTS) for the framework, but also focus on fixing bugs and positive improvements.However, compared with the development speed of its framework, the corresponding document updates are not so timely. Some developers have expressed concern about the speed of updates to their CLI documentation.The figure below is an interactive service interface (https://update.angular.io/) designed to facilitate the use of Angular developers. You can customize the current version and update target of the framework to get a list of updates.Since AngularJS’s documentation (https://docs.angularjs.org/api) and tutorials provide a wider range than Angular 2+, it has been praised by developers.The React community encountered documentation issues similar to Angular. Because the React environment and how it works are frequently updated, you must be prepared for changes and continuous learning when using React.Although React already has some recent versions of the documentation (see: https://reactjs.org/versions/), keeping up with all the changes and integrations is not a simple task.Fortunately, the support of its community has offset such problems to some extent. React has a large number of developers who can often share their knowledge on thematic forums.⑧Learning curve: Angular is steeperAngular’s learning curve is considered steeper than React. Angular is a complex and lengthy framework that can solve some single problems through various methods. However, it requires many repetitive operations to achieve complex component management.As we mentioned above, the framework is constantly evolving, so developers have to adapt to various changes.In addition, because Angular 2+ uses Type and RxJS, although Type is close to Java, users still need to spend some time learning RxJS.Due to frequent updates, React also requires users to continuously learn. Of course, if you are already good at using Java, you don’t need to spend too much time starting over.At present, because about 60% of React application construction will use Redux, Redux has become an essential tool, and the React learning curve is mainly determined by the Redux library.However, React also provides a variety of practical tutorials for beginners, please refer to:https: //reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html⑨Community and acceptance: the two are on parReact is slightly more popular on GitHub than Angular. It has 113,719 stars and 6,467 followers; Angular has only 41,978 stars and 3,267 followers.According to the 2018 version of the Stack Overflow Developer Survey (as shown in the figure below), Angular’s developers accounted for 37.6%, while React’s users accounted for 28.3%.It is worth mentioning that the survey covers AngularJS and Angular 2+ users.Interestingly: Angular also leads in negative reviews. According to the same survey, 45.6% of developers think Angular is one of the worst frameworks.Of course, such negative feedback may be affected by the fact that many developers are still using AngularJS. After all, AngularJS has more problems than Angular 2+. And Angular’s community is even larger.Relatively speaking, React’s numbers are more attractive, with only 30.6% of professional developers unwilling to use it.Which framework would you choose?In summary, the basic idea behind Angular is to provide powerful support and toolsets for the overall experience of front-end development.Thanks to the constant updates and active support of the Google team, the framework will not appear “savage growth”.The engineers behind it will work hard to protect the existing community and assist various developers and companies to switch from AngularJS to Angular 2+ with higher performance and smaller application size.At the same time, as your application gradually reaches an enterprise-level scale, Type can increase the maintainability of application code, so it becomes more and more important. Of course, these will also make developers face a steep learning curve.React provides a more lightweight solution, suitable for developers who don’t have much learning time and need to get started quickly.Although its code base does not specify various tool sets and methods, common tools such as Redux still require you to spend extra time to learn.Moreover, because React’s performance is comparable to Angular, it is still very attractive to developers.Written bySajjad HussainDigital NomadFollow12 12 12 ReactAngularProgrammingWeb DevelopmentWeb DesignMore from Sajjad HussainFollowDigital NomadMore From MediumThe Ultimate Guide to Electron with ReactAditya Patnaik in FOLK DevelopersData Scraping in Node.js 101Danny Denenberg in Better ProgrammingWeb Components API in a NutshellIndrek Lasn in Better ProgrammingStreams, Piping, and Their Error Handling in Node.jsKunal Tandon in Developer’s ArenaHow to publish packages that can be used in browsers and NodeZell Liew in freeCodeCamp.org50 Things I Wish I Learned Earlier as a DeveloperPiero Borrelli in JavaScript In Plain EnglishHow to build a Laravel REST API with Test-Driven DevelopmentKofo Okesola in freeCodeCamp.orgScalable Redux: decoupling selectors from the state shapeAsís García in TrabeAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Best of Modern JavaScript — Prototypes and Calls,https://medium.com/dev-genius/best-of-modern-javascript-prototypes-and-calls-a17b2631d083?source=tag_archive---------23-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Jo Szczepanska on UnsplashSince 2015, JavaScript has improved immensely.It’s much more pleasant to use it now than ever.In this article, we’ll look at prototypes and method calls in JavaScript.Prototype ChainsJavaScript objects are a chain of one or more objects.The first object inherits properties from later objects.For example, the prototype chain of an array has an instance with the elements of the array.Array.prototytpe has the properties provided by the Array constructor.Object.prototype has the properties provided by the Object constructor.And null is the end of the chain.We can use the Object.getPrototype of method to get the prototype of the array.For example, we can write:const arr = ['a', 'b'];const proto = Object.getPrototypeOf(arr);Then we see the contents of the array’s prototype in the proto variable.We can see various methods, the iterator, and more.We can also use the getOwnPropertyNames method to get the names of the member of the prototype.We can write:const arr = ['a', 'b'];const p = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(arr);And we get [“0”, “1”, “length”] as the value of p .These are the properties that can be enumerated.Dispatched Method CallsIf we call an instance, the JavaScript interpreter does 2 steps.It gets the method from the prototype chain.And then it calls the method with the value of this and the arguments.For example, we can make the 2 steps explicit by writing:const func = arr.toString;func.call(arr);Use Cases for Direct Method CallsDirect method calls are useful in ES5 since there’s no spread operator to call a function with an array spread as arguments.To call methods with an array of items as arguments, we can write:const arr = [1, 2];Array.prototype.push.apply(arr, [3, 4])We call push with the apply method.arr is the value of this , which is the array instance.The 2nd argument is the array of arguments we want to pass into push .Then arr is [1, 2, 3, 4] .The spread operator replaces the use of apply .For instance, we can write:const arr = [1, 2];arr.push(...[3, 4]);It’s much simpler and we don’t have to worry about the value of this .They do the same thing.We can also use the spread operator with the new operator.For example, we can write:new Date(...[2020, 11, 25])apply can’t be used with new since we haven’t created an instance of the constructor yet.In ES5, there’s no easy way to convert an array-like object into an array.For instance, if we want to convert the arguments object into an array, we’ve to use the Array.prototype.slice method to do so.For example, we can write:function foo(a, b, c) {  var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);  console.log(args);}We called Array.prototype.slice.call which takes an iterable object.It returns an array, so we can use array operations and methods with it.Likewise, we can use this for the Nodelist returns by document.querySelectorAll ,For example, we can write:var divs = document.querySelectorAll('div');var arr = Array.prototype.slice.call(divs);We pass the divs , which is a NodeList into the slice.call method to convert it into an array.With ES6, these are all replaced by the spread and rest operators:function foo(...args) {  console.log(args);}andconst divs = document.querySelectorAll('div');const arr = [...divs];We used the rest operator with foo to get the arguments as an array.And we used the spread operator to spread the div into an array.Photo by Berkeley Communications on UnsplashConclusionThere’re a few ways to call methods.We can call them from the instance, or we can call them with call and apply .Dev GeniusCoding, Tutorials, News, UX, UI and much more related to developmentFollow66 Sign up for Best StoriesBy Dev GeniusThe best stories sent monthly to your email. Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

Best of Modern JavaScript — Callable Entities,https://medium.com/@hohanga/best-of-modern-javascript-callable-entities-200291afe8d0?source=tag_archive---------24-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Julian Hochgesang on UnsplashSince 2015, JavaScript has improved immensely.It’s much more pleasant to use it now than ever.In this article, we’ll look at functions and classes in JavaScript.Generator FunctionsGenerator functions are new to ES6.They’re denoted by the function* keyword.The value of this in a generator function is handled the same way as in traditional functions.We can’t call a generator function as a constructor.If we do, we’ll get a TypeError .We can define them as function expressions:const foo = function*(x) {  //...};Or we can define them as function declarations:function* foo(x) {  //...};Generator functions only return generator objects.Method DefinitionsMethod definitions are functions that are defined in object literals.For instance, we can write:const obj = {  add(x, y) {    return x + y;  },     sub(x, y) {    return x - y;  }, };We defined the add and sub methods in our obj object.Also, we can define methods in classes.For example, we can write:class Calc {  add(x, y) {    return x + y;  }  sub(x, y) {    return x - y;  }}There’re no commas after each method in a class.We can call super or methods of super in class methods.Generator Method DefinitionsGenerators can be added as methods in an object or a class.The syntax is the same as regular methods.For instance, we can write:const obj = {  * gen() {    //...  },};In classes, we can write:class Gen{  * gen() {    //...  }}We can use this and super like any other class methods.Arrow FunctionsArrow functions don’t have their own value for the following variables:argumentssuperthisnew.targetThey take the value of them from the surrounding scope.They can’t be used as constructor.If we try to use it with the new keyword, we’ll get a TypeError.ClassesClasses is easier to use the syntax for constructor functions.We can define them with methods by writing:class Point {  constructor(x, y) {    this.x = x;    this.y = y;  }  toString() {    return `${this.x}, ${this.y}`;  }}We create the Point class with the toString method and a constructor.To create a child class of the Point class, we can use the extends keyword:class ThreeDPoint extends Point {  constructor(x, y, z) {    super(x, y);    this.z = z;  }  toString() {    return `${super.toString()}, ${this.z}`;  }}We called super in the constructor to call the parent Point constructor.And we called super.toString() to call the Point instance’s toString method.Classes can’t be called as functions or methods.Constructor follows subclassing syntax.The base class has its own this .And subclasses has a this with the properties of the parent class instance and its own instance.We’ve to call super before we can access this .Dispatched and Direct Method CallsWe can call dispatch method call by calling a method on the instance.For instance, calling arr.splice(1, 1) is calling splice on the arr array instance.A direct call is calling a function with call or apply .For instance, we can write:Array.prototype.splice.call(arr, 1, 1)or:Array.prototype.splice.apply(arr, [1, 1])to call splice with arr as the value of this and the arguments either as arguments or in an array.Photo by Vinicius ""amnx"" Amano on UnsplashConclusionThere’re many kinds of callable entities in JavaScript.

Object-Oriented JavaScript — Strings,https://medium.com/@hohanga/object-oriented-javascript-strings-90004955d4da?source=tag_archive---------25-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Rajiv Perera on UnsplashJavaScript is partly an object-oriented language.To learn JavaScript, we got to learn the object-oriented parts of JavaScript.In this article, we’ll look at strings, which is one of the building blocks of objects.StringsA string is a sequence of characters to represent text.Any values placed between single quotes, double quotes, or backticks are string.If we have:let s = ""foo"";typeof s;Then typeof s returns 'string' .If we put nothing between the quotes, it’s still a string.The + operator is used to concatenate 2 strings.If we have:let s1 = ""web"";let s2 = ""site"";let s = s1 + s2;Then we s is 'website' .And typeof s would be 'string' .This is a source of errors in the system.To avoid errors, we should make sure that operators are strings.This way, we won’t be adding anything by accident.String ConversionsA string is converted to a number behind the scene if a number string is encountered.For instance, if we have:let s = '1';s = 2* s;Then typeof s returns 'number' .If we have:let s = '1';s++;Then s++ converts s to 'number' .We can convert a number string to a number by multiplying y 1 or use parseInt .For instance, we can write:let s = ""100"";s = s * 1;Now s is a string.If the conversion fails, we get NaN .There’re many strings with special meanings.\ is the escape character.We can use it to escape \, ' and "" so that they can be in th string.For instance, we can write:const s = ""1\\2"";and s is 1 \ 2 .\n is the line end character.If we have:let s = ‘\n1\n2\n3\n’;We get:""123""\r is the carriage return character.If we have:let s = '1\r2'We get:“12”\t is the tab character. If we have:let s = ""1\t2"";We get:""1 2""\u is the character code that lets us use Unicode.For instance, we can write:let s = 'e\u0301'and s is'é'String Template LiteralsES6 introduced the template literal.They let us embed expressions within regular strings.ES6 has template literals and tagged literals.Template literals are single or multiline strings with embedded expressions.For instance, we can write:const level = ""debug"";const message = ""meltdown"";console.log(`level: ${level} - message: ${message}`)We have the level and message variables embedded into the template literals.So we get:'level: debug - message: meltdown'logged.Template literals are surrounded by backtick characters instead of quotes.They’re concatenated into a single string.We can have any expression int eh ${} .For instance, we can write:const a = 10;const b = 10;function sum(x, y) {  return x + y}function multiply(x, y) {  return x * y}console.log(`sum is ${sum(a, b)} and product is ${multiply(a, b)}.`);We embed the result of the function calls into the template literal.And we get:'sum is 20 and product is 100.'returned.Photo by Amrit Sangar on UnsplashConclusionStrings are a sequence of characters.We can create strings and template literals, which can have expressions embedded in them.Written byJohn Au-YeungWeb developer.

The Importance of Responsive Design,https://medium.com/@srishti.nath/the-importance-of-responsive-design-1e26b1f0ce0a?source=tag_archive---------27-----------------------,"Development,Web Development,Web Design,CSS,HTML","I recently finished publishing a website and put a link out for friends and family to visit, and got multiple messages saying, “This looks really messed up on my phone.”My website without responsive designMy initial reaction was Well I didn’t make it for your phone, I made it for your MacBook Pro, and your 14"" laptop screen, on your Chrome browser full screened. Clearly, I had had a very narrow vision.Obviously, we live in a time with multiple types of screens and devices, and in website design, user experience is the top most priority. I had heard of responsive design, but thought it was going to take forever to even attempt to implement it, especially in a website I had already deployed.After some research, I found I was clearly wrong.So, first, what is responsive design?Responsive design is a way of designing a website so that it accommodates viewing across different devices and screens. It’s not an official framework or a philosophy, per say, and there are many ways to implement it. It can prevent some of the really annoying things about using web browsers on a phone, like horizontal scrolling, zooming to read text, and images that are too big.What are the benefits of it?Your viewers can see your app / website across all devices in a much more UX-friendly way.Google’s SEO in 2015 stated they would prioritize mobile-friendly websites. Responsive websites will be ranked higher in search results.Increased brand value through accessibility. For businesses, having a cohesive UX across all devices means uptake of new features, etc., will be easier across their customer base. For developers, having a consistent look across all devices proves you’re well versed in contemporary needs and are hip with what the kids are into these days.How do I implement it?The beauty of responsive design is that you only need HTML and CSS!Set the viewport on all your pages:<meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"">(if you’re using React to create pages, it’s already included in your index page)2. Structure your page in a way that would make it easy to change using any of the following:Elements with relative width values (i.e., in percentage instead of pixels)A grid systemUse ‘Float: left’ combined with a media query (below) to dictate elements’ position on a pageAlways design for mobile viewing firstAnd the most important one: CSS Media queries3. Use CSS Media queries to create breakpoints in view size@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {  body {    background-color: lightblue;  }}In this example, if the screen is less than 600px, the background will be light blue.Some common breakpoints:/* Extra small devices (phones, 600px and down) */@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {...}/* Small devices (portrait tablets and large phones, 600px and up) */@media only screen and (min-width: 600px) {...}/* Medium devices (landscape tablets, 768px and up) */@media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {...}/* Large devices (laptops/desktops, 992px and up) */@media only screen and (min-width: 992px) {...}/* Extra large devices (large laptops and desktops, 1200px and up) */@media only screen and (min-width: 1200px) {...}My website after implementing responsive designSome very helpful resources:Responsive Web DesignCSS Media QueryWell, there you have it.

Object-Oriented JavaScript — Numbers,https://medium.com/@hohanga/object-oriented-javascript-numbers-d8a9f0a86295?source=tag_archive---------28-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Diego González on UnsplashJavaScript is partly an object-oriented language.To learn JavaScript, we got to learn the object-oriented parts of JavaScript.In this article, we’ll look at the building blocks of objects, which are primitive values.Primitive Data TypesJavaScript has a few primitive data types.They’re numbers, strings, booleans, undefined , null , and bigints.Numbers are floating-point numbers and integers.Strings are any group of characters.Booleans are either true or false .undefined is a value that doesn’t exist.null represents an empty value.Bigints are integers that end with an n and can be outside of the safe range, which is between -2 ** 53 and 2 ** 53 .Any value that isn’t these types are objects.Finding Out the Value TypeWe can find the value of a primitive value with the typeof operator.typeof can return 'number' . 'string' , 'boolean' , 'undefined' , 'object' or 'function' .Numbers are one of the types that can be detected with typeof .NumberFor instance, we can write:let n = 1;typeof n;and we’ll get 'number' .Octal and Hex NumbersOctal and hexadecimal numbers also returns 'number' .For instance, we can write:let n = 0o377;typeof n;to write an octal number and check its type.To check a hex number, we can write:let n = 0x00;typeof n;That will also return 'number' .Binary NumbersWe can also write binary literals with the 0b prefix,.For instance, we can write:let n = 0b111;ExponentsExponents can be written with e .For instance, we can write:1e1and get 10.If we pass it to typeof , we get 'number' :typeof 1e1InfinityInfinity is another kind of number.It’s a number too big for JavaScript to handle.Infinity is a number, so if we write:typeof Infinitywe get 'number' .Dividing by 0 gives us infinity. For instance, if we write:let a = 1 / 0then a is Infinity .The smallest number is -Infinity .When we have:Infinity - Infinityor- Infinity + Infinitywe get NaN since they are indeterminate in their value.But everything else gives us Infinity or -Infinity .For instance, we can write:Infinity - 20we get Infinity .If we write:-Infinity * 3we get -Infinity .There’s a global isFinite function to check is a number is finite or not.ES6 also adds the Number.isFinite to do the same check.The difference is that the global isFinite function casts the value before it does the check.And Number.isFinite doesn’t do that.NaNNaN stands for not a number.It’s a special value that’s also a number.If we write:typeof NaNwe get 'number' .When we do some arithmetic with non-number values, then we get NaN .For example, if we have:let a = 10 * ""a""We get NaN .We can check if a value is NaN with the Number.isNaN method.There’s also the global isNaN method.The difference is that the global one does casting and the non-global one doesn’t.So:Number.isNaN('test')returns false butNumber.isNaN(NaN)returns true .Number.isInteger is a method that checks if a value is a finite integer.For instance, if we have:Number.isInteger(123)then that returns true .But if we have:Number.isInteger('foo')that returns false .It doesn’t do casting before it does the comparison.Photo by Andrew Buchanan on UnsplashConclusionThere are various kinds of primitive values in JavaScript.One of them is a number.There’re various representations of numbers.Written byJohn Au-YeungWeb developer.

L for low, M for medium, Q for quantile, and H for high.The background and foreground can also change.It can also be rendered as a SVG or canvas.vue-image-crop-uploadThe vue-image-crop-upload component lets us create an image cropper with upload capability.To install it, we run:npm i vue-image-crop-uploadThen we can use it by writing:<template>  <div>    <my-upload      field=""img""      @crop-success=""cropSuccess""      @crop-upload-success=""cropUploadSuccess""      @crop-upload-fail=""cropUploadFail""      v-model=""show""      :width=""300""      :height=""300""      url=""/upload""      lang-type=""en""      :params=""params""      :headers=""headers""      img-format=""png""    ></my-upload>    <img :src=""imgDataUrl"">  </div></template><script>import myUpload from ""vue-image-crop-upload"";export default {  data() {    return {      show: true,      params: {        token: ""123456798"",        name: ""avatar""      },      headers: {        smail: ""*_~""      },      imgDataUrl: """"    };  },  components: {    ""my-upload"": myUpload  },  methods: {    toggleShow() {      this.show = !this.show;    },    cropSuccess(imgDataUrl, field) {      this.imgDataUrl = imgDataUrl;    },    cropUploadSuccess(jsonData, field) {      console.log(jsonData, field);    },    cropUploadFail(status, field) {      console.log(status, field);    }  }};</script>v-model is used for showing and hiding the cropper.The events are for listening to various cropping events.The format can be changed.lang sets the language of the cropper.vue2-animate for Vue.js 2vue2-animate for Vue.js 2 is a CSS animation library.To install it, we run:npm i vue2-animateThen we can use it by writing:main.jsimport Vue from ""vue"";import App from ""./App.vue"";import ""vue2-animate/dist/vue2-animate.min.css"";Vue.config.productionTip = false;new Vue({  render: h => h(App)}).$mount(""#app"");App.vue<template>  <div>    <button @click=""show = !show"">toggle</button>    <transition name=""fade"">      <p v-if=""show"" style=""animation-duration: 0.3s"">hello</p>    </transition>  </div></template><script>export default {  data() {    return {      show: false    };  }};</script>We add the CSS so that we can use them instead of writing our own CSS code.Now we can just add the transition or transition-group without adding our own CSS.Vue Input MaskVue Input Mask lets us add an input mask to our Vue app.To use it, we install it by running:npm i vue-text-maskThen we use it by writing:<template>  <div>    <label>Number</label>    <masked-input      type=""text""      name=""phone""      class=""form-control""      v-model=""phone""      :mask=""[/\d/, /\d/, /\d/]""      :guide=""false""      placeholderChar=""#""    ></masked-input>  </div></template> <script>import MaskedInput from ""vue-text-mask"";export default {  components: {    MaskedInput  },  data() {    return {      phone: """"    };  }};</script>We bind the value entered to the v-model with phone .The mask prop sets the input format, and we set each character with a regex.v-moneyv-money is another input mask component, but it only works with entering currencies.To install it, we run:npm i v-moneyThen we can use it by writing:main.jsimport Vue from ""vue"";import App from ""./App.vue"";import money from ""v-money"";Vue.use(money, { precision: 2 });Vue.config.productionTip = false;new Vue({  render: h => h(App)}).$mount(""#app"");App.vue<template>  <div>    <money v-model=""price"" v-bind=""money""></money>    {{price}}  </div></template> <script>import { Money } from ""v-money"";export default {  components: { Money },  data() {    return {      price: 0,      money: {        decimal: "","",        thousands: ""."",        prefix: ""$ "",        suffix: "" US"",        precision: 2,        masked: false      }    };  }};</script>precision is the decimal number’s decision.We set all the properties in money as props with v-bind=""money"" .So we can set the decimal separator, thousands separator, prefix, suffix, and more.Photo by Coen van den Broek on UnsplashConclusionqrcode.vue lets us add a QR code.v-money lets us add a money input.Vue Input Mask is a more versatile input mask component.vue-image-crop-upload is an image cropper.Written byJohn Au-YeungWeb developer.

The short story of a 8 month assistant programmer.,https://medium.com/dev-genius/the-short-story-of-a-8-month-assistant-programmer-c3cc5e7e405d?source=tag_archive---------31-----------------------,"Programming,Job Hunting,PHP,Laravel,Web Development","I will tell about my current situation with how I got to this situation.programming imageThe end of September of last year is when I entered a programming school. I had absolute no IT background as I was only a service staff. I studied Microsoft Office Specialist expert and got the qualification in excel and word during the service staff period, but that was more than 7 years ago, and as I have never used the skills, I forgot most of the functioning stuff.programming schoolThe programming course lasted only 3 months. There, what I learnt was HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Sass, PHP, wordpress, GitHub, MySQL, which are mainly for front-end programming. I soon started job hunting after graduation, and luckily I got an assistant programmer position at web creating company. Although they are a tiny company with around 50 employees, they have their own service of SNS present campaigns which is held only by a couple of companies in my country now. The boss was wondering if he was going to hire me because I was complete a beginner in this industry. So instead hiring me at a full commitment worker, he decided to contracted with me only 3 months, and gave me a programming assignment to see how I can progress. Unfortunately, my knowledge in IT is too poor before talking about programming skills, but my other skills like carrying out tasks with full of responsibilities and subtleties are highly approved by other colleagues, so he wanted to extend my contract and set up a new position for me, although not as a programmer, that’s what he judged me. He added saying that he wants me to be a programmer in the end, so study outside work. Although I wondered if I was going to change a job as soon as possible and not count this company as one of my working experiences, but I decided to stay as there was no other attractive companies to go, and was hoping to improve my skills quickly, and change the position soon.I’ve been feeling the time passes so slow since my position changed. They were exactly the same 3 months passed as an assistant programmer(learning every single day at work), and as a tester/management staff(mostly making service manuals, specifications, and data collection on spreadsheets). I have no overtime work at all now, and job is quite easy, but I feel bored most of the time, and feel like I am in comfort zone being lazy. Besides, two new programmers joined our company, and I do not feel like I may have a chance to change my position. Instead, I have more and more administrative tasks asked, and feel like I will never be able to code in this company.The image of my current situationDuring the later period, I studied myself, and have been creating a site, but how I felt exactly shows how much I enjoy at work. This is when I started considering about job hunting.Job huntingI will have a meeting with my boss regarding my contract in a few months, so I am planning to ask him for changing my position to development, if not, I would leave this company. For that matter, I started job hunting this month. I want to post my blog regularly at least fortnightly, but because of my job hunting and etc, I may decrease the posting frequency as it is tough to make concentrated time for this. I will keep posting my blog as possible though. Wish me luck for a better job!

 const onChange = value => {    setValue(value);  };  return (    <div>      <InputNumber value={value} onChange={onChange} />    </div>  );}We have a function to set the value state and get the value and pass it to the value prop as with any other inputs.Also, we can make it read-only or disable it.The formatting of the number can also change.rc-notificationrc-notification provides us with a UI component for adding notifications in a React app.To install it, we run:npm i rc-notificationThen we can use it by writing:import React, { useEffect } from ""react"";import Notification from ""rc-notification"";export default function App() {  useEffect(() => {    Notification.newInstance({}, notification => {      notification.notice({        content: ""content""      });    });  }, []);  return <div />;}We import the Notification object and call the newInstance method to display a notification within the callback.The notice method shows the notification content.content has the notification content.By default, it displays for 1.5 seconds.We can change the duration of that it’s displayed, the styles, and more.We can also remove the notification programmatically.Photo by Alina Chernysheva on UnsplashConclusionreact-tabs lets us add tabs.rc-upload is a file uploader component.rc-input-number is a numerical input for React apps.rc-notification is a simple notification component.Dev GeniusCoding, Tutorials, News, UX, UI and much more related to developmentFollow73 Sign up for Best StoriesBy Dev GeniusThe best stories sent monthly to your email. Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

"Not using the same name for component file, component template declarations and a components name property",https://medium.com/@hamish.clulee/tips-for-new-vuejs-players-1ac24e0c7d62?source=tag_archive---------34-----------------------,"Vue,Vuejs,Frontend,Front End Development,Web Development","Tips For New VueJs PlayersSome common mistakes I observe from juniors devs and how to correct them, primarily focused on VueJs applications.Not using the same name for component file, component template declarations and a components name property<template>  <foo-bar-component></foo-bar-component><template>import FooBarComponent from '../components/FooBarComponent.vue'default {  name: 'FooBarComponent',  components: {    'foo-bar-component': FooBarComponent  }}Component template declarations should be written in the snake-case version of the component file name, the file name should be written in PascalCase.To convert PascalCase to snake-case, simply replace the capital letters (except for the first!) into hypens:YouAreAwesome --> you-are-awesomeThisMakesDebuggingEasier --> this-makes-debugging-easierYes — this makes debugging easier, when using VueDevTools, it’s much easier to find everything if all the names; file name, name attribute in the component and the component decalration in template blocks, are all the same except for casing.Not line wrappingBad<div class=""warning-subtext"">{{firstLetterUpperCase(participant.fullName)}} will not be able to see your message until his/her employer turns Coach Chat on.</div>Good<div class=""warning-subtext"">  {{firstLetterUpperCase(participant.fullName)}}   will not be able to see your message until his/her employer   turns Coach Chat on.</div>Bad<div class=""survey-popup-card-footer"">  <b-button class=""btn-heartbeat small white"" variant=""secondary"" @click=""handleHidePopup"">BACK TO SURVEY</b-button>  <b-button class=""btn-heartbeat small blue"" variant=""primary"" @click=""handleCancelSurveyToDeleteQuestions"">CANCEL</b-button></div>Good<div class=""survey-popup-card-footer"">  <b-button    class=""btn-heartbeat small white""    variant=""secondary""    @click=""handleHidePopup""  >BACK TO SURVEY</b-button>  <b-button    class=""btn-heartbeat small blue""    variant=""primary""    @click=""handleCancelSurveyToDeleteQuestions""  >CANCEL</b-button></div>Badimport { FETCH_EMBER_PATHS, FETCH_EMBER_REVIVE_PATHS, FETCH_EMBER_FILTERED_PRACTICES, FETCH_EMBER_PRACTICES_BY_ID, FETCH_EMBER_PRACTICES_BY_PATHS, FETCH_EMBER_PATH_ELIGIBILITY } from '../../store/modules/embers/constants';Goodimport {   FETCH_EMBER_PATHS,  FETCH_EMBER_REVIVE_PATHS,  FETCH_EMBER_FILTERED_PRACTICES,  FETCH_EMBER_PRACTICES_BY_ID,  FETCH_EMBER_PRACTICES_BY_PATHS,  FETCH_EMBER_PATH_ELIGIBILITY } from '../../store/modules/embers/constants';Line wrapping is an easy thing to do, it means we can have two or three files open in our editors at a time, it means we can read PR’s without side scrolling, which means reading them faster, it makes code easier to read, and if code is eaiser to read it’s easier to debug. If code is well line wrapped, it’s also less likely to contain bugs, because you are not hiding things off screen.This doesn’t need to be done manually, the VSCode prettier extension has really good Vue support and does an excellent job at automating formmating.Not using the same NodeJ version between code basesSwicthing between projects should be easy — pull repo, checkout branch, npm install, run dev — write code — should be quick, quick enough that you don’t feel like you have to go and make a coffee after you run dev. You should be able to say to any other FE dev, “Run my branch and see what I mean” and they should be able to do this very quickly, having the same Node version is a big part of this.Generally this problem arises when SCSS/SASS is in use, if you are not using pre-processors, then you can probably ignore this.Node 12.x is an even version number, which means it’s an LTS version, Long Term Stable release. This means bugs in Node get fixed but the Node maintainers. It also means that when we upgrade our build systems, there is one less thing to do.I suggest using the nvm package, Node Version Manager. Instal it then say nvm current and see the output, if you are interesting in correctness you should see 12.xx.xx or 14.xx.xx. The most importnat thing here is seeing the same across team members.TL;DR — install nvm then say:nvm install 12.16.1 && nvm alias default 12.16.1Not providing a :key when using v-forFor reference and the docsBasically, if you write a v-for you need to provide a key<my-awesome-component        class=""intelligent-reusable-class-name""        v-for=""(value, index) in listOfThings""        :key=""index""    ></my-awesome-component>If you read the docs carefully, you will that there are some higher end performance use cases where you would not use a :key. If you think you have found one of those use cases, contact Hamish to discuss, otherwise, use a :key.For our purposes, we use the :key every time we use v-for.Not writing reusable unit’s of code or new componentsThis item is a preview of another post that I am currently writing. Even if you’re using a framework like vuetify or vue-bootstrap (which I don’t encourage or agree with, but regardless), that shouldn’t mean that you never write new custom components. Common cases — when using a framework- would be things like wrapper components for commonly used groups of framework components, if you are often using a set of two or three buttons, write a wrapper component called HorizontalButtonWrapper, or writing v-if / v-else blocks in a top level router component, use a component to wrap the logic and reduce the number of lines in the template block.Anytime you find you self using CTRL+C CTRL+V — write a new component, and reuse code rather than using the same code twice! One of the main advantages of using an SPA framework like Vue is code reusage. Components are how that advantage is manifested. It also provides developers the ability to really reduce bundle sizes if used correctly.There is a limit to how far you should go, having thousands of files in your repository that are very rarely used is just another symptom of inexperience or disorganised thinking. But what I have seen much more of is huge Vue files, with a ton of spagetti code making debugging or refactoring much much slower, and as above, fully ignoring one of the main benefit’s of using Vue in the first place.The more code you resuse, the less bugs you will create.The more code you resuse, the less unit tests you will have to write.The smaller your unit’s of code, the eaiser they will be to test.Anytime you find you self using CTRL+C CTRL+V — write a new function, and reuse code rather than using the same code twice!Some examplesBad<template>  <div class=""row-container"">    <div class=""row-item-container one"">      <div class=""row-item-actual"">{{ someData }}</div>    </div>  </div>    <div class=""row-container"">    <div class=""row-item-container two"">      <div class=""row-item-actual"">{{ someOtherData }}</div>    </div>  </div>    <div class=""row-container"">    <div class=""row-item-container three"">      <div class=""row-item-actual"">{{ someMoreData }}</div>    </div>  </div></template>Good<template>  <div    class=""row-container""    :class=""value.className""    v-for=""(value, index) in computedProperty""    :key=""index""  >    <div class=""row-item-container>      <div class=""row-item-actual"">{{ value.data }}</div>    </div>  </div></template>default {  computed: {    computedProperty() {      return [        { value: this.someData, className: 'one' },        { value: this.someOtherData, className: 'two' },        { value: this.someMore∂Data, className: 'three' }      ]    }  }}Even Better<template>  <row-container    class=""row-container""    :class=""value.className""    v-for=""(value, index) in computedProperty""    :key=""index""    :dataAsProp=""value.data""  ></row-container></template>default {  computed: {    computedProperty() {      return [        { value: this.someData, className: 'one' },        { value: this.someOtherData, className: 'two' },        { value: this.someMore∂Data, className: 'three' }      ]    }  }}Anytime you can reduce code reusage, you are actually saving time. Less bugs, less maintenace, making things easier to read and understand for the next guy.You may think “But it’s faster this way!”It’s not.It’s faster today, but it means that once you are feature complete, you spend three sprints fixing bugs, instead of a couple of hours. You also learn nothing, which means that next time you have to do the same task, you do the same thing. If you wrote it well the first time, and wrote it in a way that you and everybody else could reuse it — you would be at lunch or at home with your family by now — but instead you’re furiously copy pasting code from somewhere, trying to meet a dead line.This is real — if you want to move faster — go slower.Anytime you find you self using CTRL+C CTRL+V — write a new function or a new component, and reuse code rather than using the same code twice!Another doc about this topic is in the works currently, because this is one of the biggest issues we have in our code bases.Ignoring warnings from build system, eslint, or VSCodeBelieve it or not — warnings exist for a reason!They exist because, smarter people than us have determined that if we deal with the warning, it will reduce bugs, and if we ignore it….We will have to spend time fixing bugs.Warnings are your friends. If you see one, google it. Then fix it. Then commit it and push it. If you can’t fix it get in touch with one of the senior guys to get some help.The problem that exists currently is that we have so many warnings, they just dont mean anything anymore. Let’s fix that!Dealing with warnings, from the Developer Console, from Webpack, from NPM and from VSCode extentions really can reduce the amount of time we spend fixing bugs… by a lot.Try to fix one warning per day. It will make you a happier developer.Using eslint-disableVery Bad// es-lint disableconst someDodgyCode = expressionThatTriggeredAnEslintWarning()Ok (but very very rare)return () => {    // Explain: 'arguments' is a javascript keyword, eslint is wrong    // Blame: Hamish    // eslint-disable-next-line no-undef    const context = this, args = arguments    const later = () => {Eslint warnings are like the warnings mentioned above, they are there for a reason. They were written by people who are top level experts in this field, they are there to help you be a better dev, and there to stop you writing buggy code.If you use es-lint disable, you must provide:// Explain: reason for using, why you think eslint is wrong    // Blame: Your Name HereI’ve only ever found two or three places where eslint disable was the right thing to do. It’s rare.Instead of using disable — google the problem, then fix your code. If you can’t fix it so the warning goes away, contact one of the more senior guys, then work it out together.If you think the eslint configuartion is wrong, talk to your team lead and change the configuration to reflect your reasoning.Use $forceUpdate99% of the time $forceUpdate() is not the correct solution, you can achieve the same results using :key and $set(), and sometimes $nextTick().There is almost never a reason to reload an entire component tree.If you find your self in a position in which you realy want to use it, contact me or one of the senior guys to work out a way to get around the problem. $forceUpdate() can easily trigger a full page reload, which is super bad for user experience, and makes a Single Page Application behave the same way a standard HTML SSR app would behave. Not good - and can always be fixed using other Vue API methods.Include Magic Numbers and String LiteralsBadconst foo = 300000this.bar = 'some awesome string'Goodimport { AWESOME_CONST } from '../constants/time.js'const FIVE_MINUTES = 1 * 1000 * 60 * 60 // Five minutes in milisecondsthis.bar = AWESOME_CONSTPretty simple: There shouldn’t be any numbers floating around the code base, declare a variable with a descriptive name and explanatory comment, same for strings, literals can’t be internationalised at a later date and magic numbers are hard to understand if you did not write them.Using unnecessary <template> blocksBad<template v-if=""someThing"">  <template v-if=""someOtherThing && anotherThing || somethingElse"">    <div>      // some content here    </div>  </template><template>Templates are invisible elements provided by VueJs to allow for grouping elements together. You dont need a template to use v-if or v-show. You can use v-if and v-show on any element!Also Bad<template v-if=""something"">  <cool-component    v-for=""(datas, index) in arrayOfData""    :key=""index""  ></cool-component></template>Using a template because you can’t use v-if and v-for on the same element. Much easier to use a computed property and Array.filter() or Object.keys()<cool-component  v-for=""(datas, index) in filteredArrayOfData""  :key=""index""></cool-component>computed: {  filteredArrayOfData() {    return arrayOfData.filter(value => {      return value !== something    })  }}It will perform faster, it’s easier to read and you are using the Vue API correctly.There is really only one place where you should be using a <template> when you want to group a number of elements together for conditional visibility.<template v-if=""something"">  <div>{{ someOtherData }}</div>  <cooler-component></cooler-component>  <span>{{ fooBar }}</span></template>Use !important when we don’t need toAnytime you find you self using !important you are probably in the wrong. When you find your self in a position in which you feel like you have to use the !important rule, it is generally because the structure of the CSS/SCSS files in your code base is incorrect. The biggest thing to remember is that CSS built as a hieracy, the reason you have to use !important is either because someone else used it before you (which leads to a never ending battle in CSS of over ridding rules using !important) or, because third party vendor CSS files have been included too far down in the CSS hieracy.I admit that some times you will have to use !important - but - before you use it, take a moment and ask your self why you are having to use it.It’s much better to fix the problem than avoid it. If you look at the CSS rules in the browser developer console, can you see if you’re over ridding a rule from a Vendor css file, or a rule that we wrote. If it’s a Vendor rule, then look at where it’s being imported, is it in main.js? If it is, is it imported before, or after the file you are currently working on?If you can’t work out why your having to use !important get in touch with Hamish and get some help, it's usually pretty easy to fix.Using a library when you could just write the code yourselfCurrently, one of our biggest problems I see is bundle size. I’ve seen codebases downloading 10 MB of assets on load, which is slow to begin with, but those assets still need to be parsed and read into memory by the browser. This makes apps feel slow and that means users are less likely to use your product.The main cause of our bundle size problems is too many libraries. This is very important, we need to stop using additional libraries to solve problems we could easily solve by writing code. After all, we are developers to right?In some cases, a library is the right option, but in a lot of cases it isn’t. I’ve seen some hilarious examples of this, and have started to write a post on this specifically, enough said for now.Using eval()Read the MDN docs, they have a good entry on this. Basically, it’s a well known security risk, and should never really need to be used. You can just about always replace eval() with window.Function().Forgetting to commit the package-lock.jsonAlways commit the package-lock.json. It’s how we ensure that everyone on the team is running the same versions of packages in their node_modules folder. Basically, the package-lock.json builds a list of the dependencies of the packages in your package.json, in our code bases it can be thousands of packages. If one team member is running v0.12 and another team member is running v1.01 it can lead to some one saying…How come your local works and mine doesn’t?These problems can be really hard to debug, and it’s easy to prevent!Written byHamish CluleePassionate about complex UI’s, sharpening pencils, VueJs and all things Javascript.FollowVueVuejsFrontendFront End DevelopmentWeb DevelopmentMore from Hamish CluleeFollowPassionate about complex UI’s, sharpening pencils, VueJs and all things Javascript.More From MediumA Guide To Prototype-Based Class Inheritance In JavaScriptJavaScript TeacherThe Good and the Bad of Vue.js Framework ProgrammingAltexSoft Inc in The StartupTeaching to learn: Check If It Is a Straight LineShane Quick in The StartupA Road to the Ultimate Testing Setup With Jest and Headless Chrome BrowserArtem Streltsov in The StartupMap, Filter, Reduce in JavaScriptJagruti Tiwari in The StartupEasy GraphQL Union Types With Apollo Client V2Julio Gudiño in SalesLoft EngineeringWhen HTML Can Be Better Than JSONFagner BrackBuild a Unit Test library with Node.js from ScratchFahad HaidariAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

And the education and training sectors are no exception. Though online platforms, such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet and Google Classroom, are some assistance to organisations, the rapid shift to the virtual world has not been all that smooth.In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many companies around the world have transitioned to a remote workforce, moving forward with hiring plans to onboard new employees virtually. Organizations are trying their best to offer training that would keep productivity flawless and assure continuity. However, offering training that gives excellent output still remains a challenge!We at PaperCrunch are trying our best to collaborate with the organisations to overcome this challenge by offering the training programs that will equip the students with the industry requirements and keep them abreast with the latest technologies used in the software industry and will benefit the candidates in increasing their knowledge base, experience in securing a well-paid job.We helped one of Goa’s oldest and most successful IT companies successfully onboard new hires during the COVID 19 pandemic. Under the PaperCrunch initiative, Web Development virtual training in New normal in partnership with Anant InfoMedia Pvt. Ltd. The training sessions for Web Developers were scheduled on topics such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, PHP, MySQL. The course duration was 3 weeks and every day 3 hours in the morning session were dedicated for the topics to be covered on that day. In the evening session, the trainees were given relevant exercises.The Trainers were experienced developers from Helix Tech, who gave a professional touch to training by giving examples from actual projects. At the end of the training course, the trainees were evaluated on the basis of a mini-project involving all the concepts that were covered. Due to the pandemic situation, this was the first time when our trainers have to take online classes over Google Meet. Initially, the students found it a bit difficult to adapt to this, but within 2–3 days everyone was comfortable. However, the main issue faced was an unreliable network connectivity. But we were very happy to hear our learner's feedback on their learning experience in this #newnormal.What some of our learner's said!To Know MoreEmail at support@papercrunchgoa.comVisit: papercrunchgoa.comCall or WhatsApp on +91–9823245881/+91–8767424954Written byPapercrunchLearn & SupportFollowWeb DevelopmentElearningCorporate PartnershipsEducationTechnologyMore from PapercrunchFollowLearn & SupportMore From MediumSetting Up Tailwind CSS in a React ProjectHarsh Patel in JavaScript In Plain EnglishHow to Modernize Your Bash Scripts By Adding GUIShalitha Suranga in The StartupThe Word “Consistency” Should Not Enter Code Quality DiscussionsBenji Shults in The StartupUnderstand JVM and JIT Compiler — Part 2Júlio Falbo32 Opinionated Advice and Lessons Learned in Software DevelopmentNicklas Millard in The StartupCreating a Rails Api Query ParamLa FountainAngular Feature Flags: Feature toggle applications by using command line environment variablesNivrith Gomatam in Angular ExplorerHow To Avoid Unnecessary App ReleasesMichael Highsmith in The StartupAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
"Top Vue Packages for Adding a Date Picker, Cookie Dialog Box, and Scrolling",https://medium.com/@hohanga/top-vue-packages-for-adding-a-date-picker-cookie-dialog-box-and-scrolling-90721e082f1a?source=tag_archive---------36-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Brooke Cagle on UnsplashVue.js is an easy to use web app framework that we can use to develop interactive front end apps.In this article, we’ll look at how the best packages for adding date pickers, scrolling, and cookie dialog box.Vue date pickVue date pick is a lightweight and responsive date time picker.We can use it by running:npm install vue-date-pickto install the package.Then our component, we write:<template>  <div>    <date-pick v-model=""date""></date-pick>    <p>{{date}}</p>  </div></template><script>import DatePick from ""vue-date-pick"";import ""vue-date-pick/dist/vueDatePick.css"";export default {  components: { DatePick },  data() {    return {      date: ""2020-01-01""    };  }};</script>We set the initial date in the data method.Then we use the bundled date-pick component to add the date picker.v-model binds the selected value to date .It also comes with CSS to style the date picker.vue-scrollvue-scroll is a package with a directive that watches scrolling.To use it, we run:npm i vue-scrollThen we can use it by writing:main.jsimport Vue from ""vue"";import App from ""./App.vue"";import vuescroll from ""vue-scroll"";Vue.use(vuescroll);Vue.config.productionTip = false;new Vue({  render: h => h(App)}).$mount(""#app"");App.vue<template>  <div v-scroll=""onScroll"" style=""height: 200px; overflow-y: scroll"">    <ul>      <li v-for=""n in 100"" :key=""n"">{{n}}</li>    </ul>  </div></template><script>export default {  methods: {    onScroll(e) {      console.log(e);    }  }};</script>We have div with a fixed height.overflow-y is set to scroll so the div will scroll when it overflows.We have 100 rows of items so it’ll definitely scroll.When it scrolls onScroll will be called because of the v-scroll directive.The e parameter is logged and we’ll see the content of it displayed in the log when we scroll.We can throttle or denounce the running of the scroll handler.To do that, we can write:Vue.use(vuescroll, { throttle: 600 })or:Vue.use(vuescroll, { debounce: 600 })We can also change the value we pass into the v-scroll directive an object and add the throttle or debounce modifier:<template>  <div    v-scroll:throttle=""{ fn: onScroll, throttle: 500 }""    style=""height: 200px; overflow-y: scroll""  >    <ul>      <li v-for=""n in 100"" :key=""n"">{{n}}</li>    </ul>  </div></template><script>export default {  methods: {    onScroll(e) {      console.log(e);    }  }};</script>throttle can be replaced with debounce .Vue Cookie LawVue Cookie Law is a component that lets us display a cookie law message on our app.It’s the message that’s displayed on many websites.To use it, we install it by running:npm i vue-cookie-lawThen we can use it by writing:main.js<template>  <footer>    <cookie-law theme=""blood-orange""></cookie-law>  </footer></template> <script>import CookieLaw from ""vue-cookie-law"";export default {  components: { CookieLaw }};</script>We just put the cookie-law component into our component.It comes with a built-in message and a button.We can style the dialog by styling the Cookie , Cookie__content , and Cookie__button class.The message can be changed with the message prop.Transitions, themes, button text, etc. all can change.It can also store the cookie setting in local storage.We can run a function when the button is clicked.It has a slot for customizing content.For instance, we can write:<template>  <footer>    <cookie-law>      <div slot-scope=""props"">        <p>This site uses cookie</p>        <button class=""skew"" @click=""props.accept"">          <span>accept</span>        </button>        <button class=""skew"" @click=""props.close"">          <span>decline</span>        </button>      </div>    </cookie-law>  </footer></template> <script>import CookieLaw from ""vue-cookie-law"";export default {  components: { CookieLaw }};</script>We can also run our own function when the accept button is clicked.For instance, we can write:<template>  <footer>    <cookie-law @accept=""thank""></cookie-law>  </footer></template> <script>import CookieLaw from ""vue-cookie-law"";export default {  components: { CookieLaw },  methods: {    thank() {      alert(""thanks"");    }  }};</script>We listen to the accept event to run something when the accept button is clicked.Photo by Srecko Skrobic on UnsplashConclusionVue date pick lets us add a lightweight and responsive date picker to our app.vue-scroll is a package that has a directive to watch scrolling.Vue Cookie Law is a component that has a cookies message.

The Front-End Developers Guide,https://medium.com/the-innovation/the-front-end-developers-guide-ff0e55bc13fe?source=tag_archive---------37-----------------------,"Web Development,JavaScript,Programming,Front End Development,Frontend Development","Your one-stop-shop for becoming a front-end developerPhoto by Lukas from PexelsSo you want to become a front-end developer. Well, you’ve come to the right spot! As the world continues to move towards a digital future, the demand for software developers continues to rise.Now more than ever, it is important that apps both look and feel good to use. The user experience is crucial to having a well-functioning app. Enter the front-end developer. Your job is to take a mock-up and data and combine them into one cohesive user experience.Let’s take a look at how to get started in becoming a front-end developer.1. HTMLThe very first thing you need to learn is HTML. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is the skeleton of a website. It supplies the structure and static content of a website. A simple HTML document looks like<!DOCTYPE html><html>  <head>    <title>My first page!</title>  </head>  <body>    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>  </body></html>This snippet gives us a page with a title of “My first page!”, which is displayed on the tab in the browser, and a header of “Hello world!”, which appears on the actual page.Some key things you need to learn about HTML are:Elements such as header and paragraphs for displaying textThe ordered and unordered list elements to create lists of data and navigationTables for displaying data in a table format. They can also be used for layout, but this is frowned upondivs and spans to be used as container elementsClasses and Id’s to give help with styling and selecting elementsOnce you have a solid understanding of HTML, you can move on to CSS.2. CSSCSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is what gives your website it’s style. You can set colors, background colors, borders, margins, padding, text size, images, and even animations using CSS. A simple CSS property can be written likeh1 {  color: red;  background-color: blue;}This snippet will take all header 1 elements and give them a font color of red and a background color of blue.CSS can be written in on an element using the style property of the element as an inline style, in between two style tags, or in a separate file.<!-- Link to File--><link href=""./app.css"" rel=""stylesheet""><!-- Style Element --><style>h1 {  color: red;  background-color: blue;}</style><!-- In-Line Element --><h1 style=""color: red;background-color: blue;"">Hi</h1>There are pros and cons to each way, but that’s for a different article.Some key things you’ll want to make sure you know are:Basic styling, like colors and fontsBackground imagesDisplay properties like inline, inline-block, and noneFloat to position content on the pageFlexbox and Grid to more easily align and position contentWith that, I think it’s time we stroll over to Javascript.3. JavascriptOnce you are comfortable building websites with HTML and CSS, you are ready to start making your websites more dynamic. You do this with Javascript. Javascript lets you manipulate the DOM, or Document Object Model. The DOM describes and HTML document as a tree-like structure of elements. This is crucial to modern day Javascript.Javascript lets you do thinks like add events to handle button clicks, dynamically change element styles, show alert windows, and even render blocks of HTML. Javascript looks likeconsole.log('Hello, world!');This line will write the statement “Hello, world!” to the developer console in your web browser.Javascript, like CSS, can be written in the HTML document between two <script> tags or it can be written in its own file and linked to the HTML document, again using script tags.The main things you need to understand in Javascript are:The DOM and how to manipulate itHow to declare and reuse variables and functionsHow to write conditional statements to control the application flowHow to use the console to write outputHow to use for loops to loop over objectsHow to use AJAX to make requests to API’sThis isn’t everything in Javascript, but it is enough to get you going with creating dynamic websites.4. Next StepsCongratulations, you are now a web developer! Once you get a feel for building websites using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, you might be asking yourself what you can do next. There are a variety of things you can do once you’ve mastered the basics. Here is a quick list of things you can start learning1. PHP and WordpressPHP is the butt of all jokes on Reddit, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t a good language. Almost 80% of websites today are running on PHP. It’s very easy to learn and makes building a backend for your website super easy. Wordpress uses PHP as a backend so if you learn PHP, you can learn Wordpress and do freelance work.2. NodeJS (or Deno)NodeJS is a runtime that lets you run Javascript on your computer. It uses Google’s V8 Javascript engine under the hood. Deno is a project that does basically the same thing, but fixes a lot of the issues that NodeJS has. Node is great as a backend for your websites and doesn’t require you to learn a new language. You also will need to learn Node if you want to start learning a front-end framework like React, Angular or Vue, as they use it for things like local development, SSR, and more.3. Javascript FrameworksReact, Angular, and Vue are all Javascript frameworks that allow you build very fast and dynamic webpages. These frameworks let you write Javascript code that changes the HTML on the page without needing to load a new HTML document. I won’t get into the details of how it all works, as each does it differently, but all three of these are very popular and will continue to grow in demand. React is probably the easiest to learn, as it is just Javascript code. Angular has a steep learning curve because it uses Typescript, a template system, and is very, very opinionated in how things should get done. Vue is somewhere in the middle.4. TypescriptTypescript is a superset of Javascript developed by Microsoft. It adds things like classes, interfaces, and type safety to Javascript code. If you’ve worked in a backend language like Java or C#, you will feel right at home using Typescript. As I said earlier, Angular requires a use of Typescript to use, while it’s optional for Vue and React. Typescript has a lot more boilerplate code to write than Javascript, but can drastically improve code safety and reusability.5. CSS Pre-ProcessorsCSS on its own can sometimes be a pain. Thankfully, we have tools like SASS and LESS to help us out. These tools add more functionality to CSS, like variables and mix-ins, to help make CSS more reusable. SASS tends to be a more popular choice than LESS, but both tools are great and will help you in writing more maintainable CSS.Because the world of web development is changing all the time, these are not the only tools that you will probably learn. There’s Babel, Webpack, JQuery, and a whole slew of other things that you can learn to build awesome websites. Once you get the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, you can doing some really awesome things. Start slow and try to really understand what everything does. When you do that, you can learn most of these other tools very, very quickly.The InnovationA place for variety of stories from different backgroundsFollow2 Sign up for The Innovation DigestBy The InnovationOfficial newsletter of The Innovation Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

9 best sensitive data exposure remediation,https://medium.com/@techletterboxb/9-best-sensitive-data-exposure-remediation-c431bc3dd466?source=tag_archive---------38-----------------------,"Web Security,Web Security Services,Web Design,Web Development,Web Security Testing","Here we discuss some sensitive data exposure remediations, which will help you to protect one of the OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities, lets start with first some introduction.What is sensitive data exposure?Sensitive Data Exposure occurs when an application does not adequately protect sensitive information. The data can vary and anything from passwords, session tokens, credit card data to private health data and more can be exposed.A few examples would be exposed data that someone mistakenly uploaded somewhere, weak crypto that means an attacker would be able to read the data if they successfully compromised the target and the lack of headers that prevent browser caching. In short, every possible way where it would have been possible to better protect the sensitive data.Weakness and Impact of not using sensitive data exposure remediationOver the last few years, this has been the most common impactful attack. The most common flaw is simply not encrypting sensitive data. When crypto is employed, weak key generation and management, and weak algorithm, protocol, and cipher usage are common, particularly for weak password hashing storage techniques. For data in transit, server-side weaknesses are mainly easy to detect, but hard for data at rest.Failure frequently compromises all data that should have been protected. Typically, this information includes sensitive personal information (PII) data such as health records, credentials, personal data, and credit cards, which often require protection as defined by laws or regulations such as the EU GDPR or local privacy laws.How to verify your application for this vulnerability?The first thing is to determine the protection needs of data in transit and at rest. For example, passwords, credit card numbers, health records, personal information, and business secrets require extra protection, particularly if that data falls under privacy laws, e.g. EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), or regulations, e.g. financial data protection such as PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). For all such data:Is any data transmitted in clear text? This concern protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, and FTP. External internet traffic is especially dangerous. Verify all internal traffic e.g. between load balancers, web servers, or back-end systems.Are any old or weak cryptographic algorithms used either by default or in older code?Are default crypto keys in use, weak crypto keys generated, or re-used, or is proper key management or rotation missing?Is encryption not enforced, e.g. are any user agent (browser) security directives or headers missing?Does the user agent (e.g. app, mail client) not verify if the received server certificate is valid?Attack scenario for vulnerabilityBefore moving towards sensitive data exposure remediations let see some example attack scenarios:Scenario #1: An application encrypts credit card numbers in a database using automatic database encryption. However, this data is automatically decrypted when retrieved, allowing a SQL injection flaw to retrieve credit card numbers in cleartext.Scenario #2: A site doesn’t use or enforce TLS for all pages or supports weak encryption. An attacker monitors network traffic (e.g. at an insecure wireless network), downgrades connections from HTTPS to HTTP, intercepts requests, and steals the user’s session cookie.The attacker then replays this cookie and hijacks the user’s (authenticated) session, accessing or modifying the user’s private data. Instead of the above, they could alter all transported data, e.g. the recipient of a money transfer.Scenario #3: The password database uses unsalted or simple hashes to store everyone’s passwords. A file upload flaw allows an attacker to retrieve the password database. All the unsalted hashes can be exposed with a rainbow table of pre-calculated hashes. Hashes generated by simple or fast hash functions may be cracked by GPUs, even if they were salted.9 sensitive data exposure remediationsHere are some sensitive data exposure remediations, so do the following, at a minimum, and consult the references:Classify data processed, stored, or transmitted by an application. Identify which data is sensitive according to privacy laws, regulatory requirements, or business needs.Apply controls as per the classification.Don’t store sensitive data unnecessarily. Discard it as soon as possible or use PCI DSS compliant tokenization or even truncation. Data that is not retained cannot be stolen.Make sure to encrypt all sensitive data at rest.Ensure up-to-date and strong standard algorithms, protocols, and keys are in place; use proper key management.Encrypt all data in transit with security protocols such as TLS with perfect forward secrecy (PFS) ciphers, cipher prioritization by the server, and security parameters. Enforce encryption using directives like HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).Disable caching for responses that contain sensitive data.Store passwords using strong adaptive and salted hashing functions with a work factor (delay factor), such as Argon2, scrypt, bcrypt, or PBKDF2.Verify independently the effectiveness of configuration and settings.Following sensitive data exposure remediations are not very tough, we just need some regular attention during the development process and in testingWritten bytechletterbox boxLearner in cybersecurity, for more info visit www.techletterbox.comFollowWeb SecurityWeb Security ServicesWeb DesignWeb DevelopmentWeb Security TestingMore from techletterbox boxFollowLearner in cybersecurity, for more info visit www.techletterbox.comMore From MediumFor The Love of Big Data, Threat Schema and Directed Graphs in CybersecurityProf Bill Buchanan OBE in ASecuritySite: When Bob Met AliceWhy You Should Care About Computer SecurityScott CosentinoData We Can TrustLeft Field Labs in Left Field LabsProper Tokenization and Encryption Would Have Saved Capital One From A Billion Dollar LossProf Bill Buchanan OBE in ASecuritySite: When Bob Met AliceGame of Trojans: Dissecting the #Khalesi Infostealer MalwareChen Erlich in The StartupStop the Best “Security Features” of Catalina from Killing Your ApplicationsDavid Tippett in The StartupThe Wonderful World of Elliptic Curve CryptographyProf Bill Buchanan OBE in CoinmonksHunting and Exploiting Apache Ghostcatjust_a_noobAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

React Redux: Removing From an Array,https://medium.com/@lawsonhung/react-redux-removing-from-an-array-a440647d9f4b?source=tag_archive---------41-----------------------,"Flatiron School,Web Development,JavaScript,React,Redux","Last week, I talked about how to add to an array in Redux. This week, to build upon and complement that, I’ll be talking about how to remove an item from an array. It’s not as easy as it may sound. It took me some Googling to find the answer to this question.This is our initial state:state={title: '',resultCt: 0,searchResults: {},nominations: []}And we’re trying to change nominations . Given the nomination index in the array, this is how we would remove an item in nominations:case 'REMOVE_NOMINATION':return {...state,nominations: [...state.nominations.slice(0, action.nominationIndex),...state.nominations.slice(action.nominationIndex + 1)]}We have to spread ... the state, then slice it up to the nomination index, and concatenate it with the other half of nominations, sliced 1 more from the nomination index up until the end.Usually, removing an item is pretty easy to do. For redux though, this was not the case. It was quite difficult to understand how to remove an item, but at least I now know how to do it.That’s it.

Use AngularJS to learn the basics of MVC,https://medium.com/@sajjadhussain-11869/use-angularjs-to-learn-the-basics-of-mvc-3e4eacc91314?source=tag_archive---------42-----------------------,"Angular,Mvc,Programming,Web Development,Web Design","Nowadays, there are many new technologies in the world, so there may be some confusion as to which ones are available and which is the best technology to build our applications.Most of the time, programmers will build their applications in MVC, because MVC (Model-View-Controller) is loosely coupled and we can reuse the structure of the pattern.ASP.NET MVC with WEB API is most suitable for server-side technology. We can reuse the same service for other communication devices (mobile devices, iPad, etc.), and the Web API will be hosted in IIS separately. It will increase the performance of the server.Angular JS is best for the client. We can use rapid development, which is very useful for data binding because it uses the RESTful protocol.Why should we use MVC?ASP.NET MVC provides you with a powerful and pattern-based way to build dynamic websites, allowing you to fully control the markup for a pleasant development experience.The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern divides the application into three main components.ModelModels are usually used for business objects. It will directly manage data, logic and application rules.ViewThis is a user interface that shows the output of the operation.RegulatorThe controller is the core of the application. It accepts input and converts it into a model or view command.Features of ASP.NET MVCWeb API supports MVC framework built by RESTful.We can use NuGet to install jQuery, AngularJS, etc.We can write the asynchronous operation method as a single method, which returns an object of the task.The routing module is responsible for mapping specific controller actions.Why should we use AngularJS?AngularJS is an open source scripting language. It will work based on the Model-View-Controller pattern and the latest client Java.One of the biggest advantages of data binding is that whenever the model changes, it will automatically change the value of the view and update the model when the view changes. This is called two-way binding.Features of AngularJSTwo-way data binding.Use and support the MVC design pattern.Support routing, just like a single page application.Support RESTful services.Dependency injection.Why should we use AngularJS in MVC?Both ASP.NET MVC and AngularJS are compatible with the MVC pattern, and there are many projects that can be used together. This is great because your MVC server-side code provides JSON results for Angular client calls .In addition, you can use the MVC controller to control the HTML view or Razor view in the application. This provides you with authorization, redirection, error handling and other functions.How to configure Angular JS in MVCOpen Visual Studio 2015 and click => File => New => ASP.NET Web Application.

5 Quick Lessons — Deep Work by Cal Newport,https://medium.com/@vibrantwebs/5-quick-lessons-deep-work-by-cal-newport-4dcb4821dfa?source=tag_archive---------43-----------------------,"Cal Newport,Deep Work,Programming,Web Development","Summary:Today, technology 💻has given us incredibly powerful tools 🛠— more powerful than any previous generation has had access to. However, alongside those powerful tools have come the most powerful DISTRACTIONS 📳 as well. Learn to use the tools without sucumbing to distractions. Work smarter, not harder, and produce higher-quality work.1. Deep Concentration is a Competitive Advantage.Committment to Deep Work is a common theme among influential figures:Carl Jung — “The Tower” 🏘For several months out of each year, famed psychologist Carl Jung would retreat to The Tower, an isolated cottage location with private offices, no electricity or running water, and no visitors, for months at a time. It was this crucial practice that allowed him to challenge Freud and change the world of psychology.Bill Gates — “Think Week” 💡Twice per year, Microsoft CEO Bill Gates would retreat to a two-story, waterfront cottage to partake in a think week. These weeks would consist mostly of reading 📚 and deep thinking 💭, with no distractions whatsoever. It was during these weeks he conceived the idea for the tablet PC, and composed his “Internet Tidal Wave” memo 📝 (which ultimately lead Microsoft to enter, and then dominate, the Internet).In today’s world, “shallow work” (which includes emails, meetings, and social media posts) requires very little concentration, and as a result, produces extremely common results. High-quality work, which requires deep concentration and specialized skillsets, is extremely rare 💎.Highly-powerful distractions such as email notifications, social media, texting, and YouTube videos have become such a powerful draw, with such powerful dopamine-addiction capibilities, that deep work/specialization has become rare — a competitive advantage.2. Start your Day on the Hardest Thing.Your attention is finite. Your attention is at its highest capacity 🔋 in the morning. As the day goes on, various tasks and distractions start to erode that capacity.For example: Let’s say you read a news article 📰. Even when you finish that news article and close your browser, a tiny piece of that news article has taken ahold of your attention capacity…and will stay there for the rest of the day.Most people start their day off by reading the news, checking e-mails, and engaging in social media. By 10 AM, your attention capacity has been completely trashed 🗑️…and your day is just beginning.Instead, wake up early ⏰ (before people expect you to respond to emails) and spend an hour or two focusing exclusively on one single thing: the hardest task of your day. By the time you get to your emails, you have already used your best attention hours on the most important task 🥇!3. Multitasking is BAD. Chunking is GOOD.It is amazing how much of an emphasis we still place on multitasking — just look at any job posting!As we mentioned: shallow work, which is the only kind of work multitasking will allow, produces low-quality work.It takes your brain several minutes to get into a concentrated state…so constantly switching 📳📧🛒💻tasks never lets you access the state where you produce your best work!Instead of multitasking, try “chunking” your work instead. Organize your tasks into “batches” 🗂️ where you can do similar-typed work all at once. This way, you are allowing your brain to focus and maximize efficiency. For example, check all your emails at once (maybe 2 times a day).If you can’t neatly batch everything into categories, at LEAST batch your “shallow” tasks away from your deep-concentration tasks. (“From 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM, I will stay away from my special project and only work on shallow tasks….answer emails, return phone calls, etc.”)Most people are capable of one to three 90-minute “chunks” of deep concentration per day.4. Schedule your ChunksHand-in-hand with #3 is to set aside specific TIMES ⏰ and LOCATIONS 🏢where your deep work will take place.Motivating yourself to focus on deep work is much harder than for shallow tasks…so your brain will naturally want to prevent you from working deeply. In other words, deciding when/what to work on is actually stressful in itself…let’s call it “decision stress”.While you can’t easily remove the stress that comes with trying to concentrate, you CAN easily remove the decision stress by scheduling and planning your deep work.Additionally, the more you “practice” 💪 sticking to the schedule, the quicker your brain will be able to enter deep concentration. The schedule becomes ingrained.As a bonus, other people ️👩👨‍👴👩‍🦱 will also “learn” your schedule…and will be less likely to try to reach you during certain times of the day.5. Be Comfortable being Bored.Humans in this day and age almost NEVER experience true boredom. This is a shame, because being bored is actually a wonderful time for creative ✨thinking .Learn to “embrace boredom”! Put your phone in another room, turn off your computer/TV, and write down a specific time that you will be allowed to access these devices again. Do activities that allow your thoughts to wander…such as listening to music, meditating, or going for a walk 🚶‍♀️.By now, we all KNOW that smart-phone/Internet distractions are bad, but few people actually COMMIT to turning them off because they fear boredom. Learn to embrace boredom.Start Doing These Now:Commit to concentration. Not reading it or watching videos about it….commit to DOING it.Pick a project/skill you want to focus on.Choose a TIME and LOCATION for working deeply on this. Start with one 90-minute chunk of time per day.Turn off all distractions, set an alarm for 90-minutes.When you get done, take a moment to reflect on how you feel and how much progress you made.Written byAndrew MusholtFull-time web developer, part-time business owner.FollowCal NewportDeep WorkProgrammingWeb DevelopmentMore from Andrew MusholtFollowFull-time web developer, part-time business owner.More From MediumDo you know the differences between Scrum and Kanban?Andre BeckerThe Three Things You Need to Be A Productivity MachineLJ Stojanovski in On Breaking the MoldHow Your Life of Procrastination Can Be a Springboard for SuccessChloe in CuriousHow to Use Music to Boost ProductivityAlexander Boswell in Mind CafeYou Don’t Need To Write A Novel During IsolationRefinery29 UK in Refinery29The Everything Guide to Good SleepKeenan Eriksson in Better HumansHow to Get Stuff Done When You Don’t Feel Like ItKasey Q.

7 Key Features on Developing a Profitable Cashback Coupon Website,https://medium.com/@enactsoft/7-key-features-on-developing-a-profitable-cashback-coupon-website-1b1794578576?source=tag_archive---------44-----------------------,"Features,Cashback,Website,Web Development,Coupon","Photo by Marvin Meyer on UnsplashIf you’re looking to Start your own cashback website business but don’t know much inside technicality, you have landed in the right place. Lots of young entrepreneurs facing the same problem during the process of “Cashback Website Development“. I am going to briefly discuss the top key features you must keep in mind during the cashback coupon website development, which will be the highly profitable fully automated cashback Coupon website.The affiliate Cashback Coupon industry is trendy, so we need to have a robust cashback website solution to compete and stand out in this environment.Before we start about key features you must have in your cashback coupon website solution, let me share some figures important figures about the cashback industry as a highly lucrative business.The Cashback Coupon industry is majorly based on E-commerce stores. Global E-commerce sales are expected to reach more than $6.5 trillion USD by 2023. As many people purchase on E-commerce stores, it is more likely to believe about super growth in the cashback coupon industry. Alone in India, the cashback and coupons industry valued at over Rs. 500 crores and increasing. Also, India’s e-commerce sector grows at an annual rate of 51%, which is the highest in the world.There are many reasons apart from numeric figures to consider that the Cashback website is the best to opt for affiliate marketing. You, me and everyone always tend to look for cashback, coupon and offer while shopping online. As per the study, it is likely to be observed that once people get successful cashback from the respective website, they become loyal customers. Loyal customers mean repeat customers. Therefore, It is a Win-Win situation for Cashback Website owners.Let’s discuss key features to consider during Cashback Coupon Development.KEY FEATURES TO CONSIDER DURING CASHBACK COUPON DEVELOPMENT1. REFER & EARN WITH BONUS AND LIFETIME EARNING IN %AGEIt is good to have thousands of people promoting your brand (cashback website) and spreading awareness based on experience.Therefore, it is important to have Refer & Earn features in your cashback website script. Through which, Customers will be happier to have cashback benefits by sharing with friends and family.Also, it must prevent any misuse of the functionality by creating multiple fake accounts and claiming cashback. Reduce the risk of ruining the purpose of Refer an earn.Cashback development company like EnactSoft provides cookie-based refer and earn program, which can be promoted via social media, Email, and SMS, etc. Just users need to fulfill the main 3 conditions below.Verified Mobile Number.The order must be placed through your website.Must have $x as cashback balance (Set by Admin).Refer and Earn promotion is highly attractive to new customers for your business.2. AUTO-UPDATE CASHBACK STATUSOnce the Customer places the order, the merchant or Affiliate network updates the order status as pending.After the merchant verifies the order, it is updated as confirmed.

SMART CASHBACK CALCULATIONCashback structure varies category to category. There are basically 2 types of cashback. One is Flat cashback and another is %age cashback. The problems for cashback website owners are to keep changing different offers globally and during seasonal sales. Therefore, there might be smart cash back calculation for website admin.HOW DOES THE SMART CASHBACK CALCULATION WORK?Let’s understand with an example.Consider that Amazon is offering a 10% Affiliate commission on the sale of a woman’s T-Shirt. A customer placed an order of worth $50 and you’re getting $5 as commission. Now, you want to pass $3 as cashback to your customer so you will set 60% as the cashback amount to be passed on to the customer. The script calculates automatically the cashback amount and shows $3 to the customer.This feature makes your system dynamic and even if you miss updating the structure at the time it won’t affect your profit.6.

JavaScript Over The Years,https://medium.com/@harshind58/javascript-over-the-years-a396a35840c6?source=tag_archive---------45-----------------------,"JavaScript,Javascript Development,Web Development,Programming Languages","1995–2020HISTORYThe foundation of JavaScript was laid down in the year of 1993 with the creation of the first GUI based web browser Mosaic which popularized the World Wide Web. The Netscape corporation was founded by the lead of Mosaic Browser in 1994 with the launch of Netscape Navigator. In the early days of web browsing the web pages used to be static. Things changed drastically in 1995 when Netscape decided to add a scripting language to Navigator. They pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java programming language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language. Netscape management decided to create a new language. The new language thus created was known as LiveScript which was then called JavaScript when it was embedded in Navigator.JavaScript’s Growth and StandardizationIn November 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to ECMA International, as the starting point for a standard specification that all browser vendors could conform to. This led to the official release of the first ECMAScript language specification in June 1997.The standards process continued for a few years, with the release of ECMAScript 2 in June 1998 and ECMAScript 3 in December 1999. Work on ECMAScript 4 began in 2000. The work on ECMAScript 4 stopped due to the rise of Internet Explorer and JScript, the reversed engineered interpreter by Microsoft.In 2005 Mozilla, the successor of Netscape started working with ECMA International for ECMAScript 4x. Google debuted its Chrome browser in 2008, with the V8 JavaScript engine that was the first to use just-in-time compilation, significantly improving execution times. Other browser vendors needed to overhaul their engines to compete.In July 2008, these disparate parties came together for a conference in Oslo. This led to the eventual agreement in early 2009 to combine all relevant work and drive the language forward. The result was the ECMAScript 5 standard, released in December 2009. It reached maturity with the publication of ECMAScript 6 in 2015.From 2016 to 2019, a new version of the ECMAScript standard was published each year, but the scope of changes was much smaller than the 5th or 6th editions. Thus JavaScript can now be considered a mature language that has largely settled down.HELLO WORLD IN JAVASCRIPTINTRODUCTIONThe “Hello, World!” program is a classic and time-honored tradition in computer programming. It’s a short and complete first program for beginners, and it’s a good way to make sure your environment is properly configured.Prerequisites : JavaScript Developer Console in your web browser.The “Hello World!” program can be completed using either of the one function alert() or console.log().Using alert()The alert method will create an alert box with a specified message and ok button over the web browser. The ok button is used to close the alert message.Syntax: alert(“Your Message”)Example: alert(“Hello World!”)Using console.log()The console.log() method is used to print any statement on JavaScript console. It is equivalent to print statements in any other language.Syntax: console.log(“Your Message”)Example: console.log(“Hello World!”)Hope you liked it!!!!!!!!!!!!!Written byHarsh GuptaA future EntrepreneurFollowJavaScriptJavascript DevelopmentWeb DevelopmentProgramming LanguagesMore from Harsh GuptaFollowA future EntrepreneurMore From MediumStrongly Keyed Maps in TypeScriptDarius in Better Programming== vs ===Abhishek Kumar in The StartupUsing SocketCluster for Distributed Computing in Node.js appsMargo McCabe in JavaScript In Plain EnglishJavaScript Type Checking with Flow — Union TypesJohn Au-Yeung in JavaScript In Plain EnglishBuild a Reusable Responsive Card Component with Styled-Componentsjsmanifest in Better ProgrammingiFrame Sandbox Permissions TutorialJim Rottinger in Looker EngineeringES6: Arrow FUNctionsKelsey Dickson10 Interview Questions for a JavaScript developerFarzana NipaAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

I chipped away at FreeCodeCamp’s Responsive Web Design Certification, paid for two full years of CodeCademy Pro, thought about signing up for Treehouse.I even had a mid-COVID-19 quarantine crisis and enrolled in a Data Science Bootcamp at General Assembly. The bootcamp was hell. I lasted 6 weeks before admitting that I was not remotely prepared to use Statistics, Python, Pandas, and the fundamentals of Machine Learning in a paid position– full-time. I panicked, dropped out, and continued clicking through the mountains of modules at FreeCodeCamp.Then I found The Odin Project.The Odin Project (TOP) seemed too good to be true. It was FREE, self-paced, gave access to live support through Discord, and required students to set up an integrated development environment (IDE). It was absolutely packed with outside resources which meant that it was designed for genuine engagement and self-discovery. And most importantly (to me), it required students to begin using the CLI immediately. TOP was the only truly robust, free program that taught students how to code as they would IRL. Without sandboxes.I read a few reviews and decided to start off with the Full Stack Ruby on Rails track. I’m one week in and still (re)reviewing the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. Only this time I actually feel like I’m learning– AND remembering things!I wrote this post as a “hello world” to introduce my personal web development journey. I mostly plan to use it as a space to write tutorials for myself, share things that I find interesting/useful, and hold myself accountable in making real progress.Ideally, I would like to complete TOP in its entirety within a year. However, if I don’t complete it at that pace I’m not going to beat myself up.I’m new to Twitter and would love to connect with other web developers (new and old) to find encouragement and guidance along the way.Written byqbobb(He/Him) | Diversity | Equity | Full-Stack Student | Books | Plants | https://linktr.ee/qbobbFollowWeb DevelopmentHTMLCSSCodingBootcampMore from qbobbFollow(He/Him) | Diversity | Equity | Full-Stack Student | Books | Plants | https://linktr.ee/qbobbMore From MediumQuickly Deploy Your React App On Google’s App EngineRoberto Herman in JavaScript In Plain EnglishA Multi-Platform Library With KotlinMrAsterisco in Better ProgrammingTemplate for Solving Matrix Chain Multiplication (MCM) Problem in DPSirmihirmsd in The StartupThe Hitchhiker’s Guide to Laravel SetupVictor Onuoha Martins in Better ProgrammingUnderstanding The Critical Rendering Path in 5 MinutesFerenc Almasi in The StartupGetting your latest releases from Deezer with PythonNikita KholinSpeculation Oriented ProgrammingIbrahim TasyurtServerless-Flow: A CI/CD Branching Workflow Optimized for Speed and QualityBen Ellerby in Serverless TransformationAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

"<strong class=""bt"">What is Web Development?</strong>",https://medium.com/@nishantgada/what-is-web-development-d7a2be3f184?source=tag_archive---------49-----------------------,"Web Development,Education,Getting Started,Careers,Blogging","Photo by Farzad Nazifi on UnsplashCreativity, Art, Patience, Persistence, Hard work, Research, Practice, Mistakes, Corrections, and Time are some of the many ingredients that make up a successful website. While this may sound intimidating at first, when you step into the world of the web, all this becomes a part of your life and becomes easily manageable.In a nutshell, Web Development is the process of using your creativity and knowledge to put your ideas into life. Various technologies that supplement this process are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, Django, etc.These technologies have been divided into categories based on their use and implementation. The categories are as follows — Front end, Back end, and Full-Stack. I’ll be explaining each of these categories in detail in my future articles. This article explains what exactly web development is, what its uses are, and what a person needs to know to get started on this path.The MeaningAs mentioned earlier, web development is designing and developing a website, using several easy-to-use technologies. It could be for personal, professional, public, or any other use. It is the process of combining several blocks of code that you’ll write to form a single entire website. It could either be a single-page website or a multi-page website like Amazon.Uses and ImplementationWebsites have become a part of our life, either for work in the form of Gmail or LinkedIn, or for personal use in the form of Google, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc. All these are websites that are used and loved by people globally. These were all developed by people who had an idea and who successfully implemented them to be wealthy. Learning web development sees its uses not only in building websites for oneself but also in helping to acquire highly paid jobs in the already set up businesses as a web developer. You could even freelance and make websites for others to earn money. There are several more perks of being a web developer that I’ll talk about in detail in my future articles.Getting StartedA common misconception about web development is that it is meant only for people with a technological background and or for engineers, whereas in reality, websites can be developed by almost anyone.Photo by Sai Kiran Anagani on UnsplashAll you need to know is HTML and CSS to get started, both of which require no prior knowledge of any programming language or technical background. There are thousands of courses and even crash-courses available that teach you HTML and CSS in no time and help you get started in as little as a single week. That’s the first step. As you dig deeper and as mentioned, do more and more research, you will start to discover everything that the world of web development has to offer.Written byNishant GadaFollow2 2 2 Web DevelopmentEducationGetting StartedCareersBloggingMore from Nishant GadaFollowMore From MediumHow to Set up a Fully Replicated Apache Ignite ClusterkommradHomer in The StartupMoving from Jython to GraalVMTim Felgentreff in graalvmCracking the Amazon InterviewThe Educative Team in Better ProgrammingHow to find all pairs of numbers that meet a criteria in a JavaScript arrayDr. Derek Austin 🥳 in Coding at DawnCode Challenge: Traversing Data Structures in SwiftWayne Bishop in Swift Algorithms ExtrasFind your Best Code Solution Understanding Big 0 NotationPiero Borrelli in AsayerUsing the Operator Lifecycle Manager to deploy Prometheus on OpenShiftCarlos Vicens in FAUNStripe Interview Question: Remove Overlapping IntervalsAngad Singh in Better ProgrammingAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

An attractive logo is one of the pre-requisites for a valued brand. In 2020, graphic designers have set a new example to craft a unique logo. New techniques and trends are coming in front using the past experience of developing. Designers skilled with iconography, enigmatic topography, along with personalized design, create the final outcome that satisfies your client as well as encourage the customers. In 2020, the popular logo trends are migrating from ‘fixed’ logos to ‘variables,’ additionally putting up an individualized connection with the client and their brands.Whether you start a new business or new website design or planning to rebrand, your brand logo must encompass the fresh trends and stay relevant for a long time.So, What makes a good logo?The symbolic piece of artwork represents your business; thus, it needs to meet the following requirements:· Brand-centric· Versatile· Timeless· RecognizableLogo Trends of 2020Ultra-chic MinimalismThe minimalist logo has gained a surge of popularity over the years. Designers execute the first impression of your brand with a sense of warmth and humor. There adds a sense of visual appeal and makes adaptable with a hint of background. This contemporary breed of logo enjoys certain practical benefits as they are more accessible. An expert designer should playfully execute and interpret the genre of business that suits the brand.Strong TopographyThe font choice is as important as the icon used in a logo. It is better to go with the type of treatment to customize your design. Outdated font structure many affect the first impression of your brand. Topography not only defines the letter you choose, but it also counts the overall structure of the logo. The overall logo should support your brand.New-age geometryThough certain trends are taking the place of individual choice, designers should not set a limit to hinder unique potential. A geometric touch to the logo can appeal a warm finish and make the logo more identifiable.Right color choiceColor often defines a story of the branding itself. Choose the color wisely. You cannot go with your favorite color palette, it should suit your brand. It is exceptionally vital to choose the right color to communicate with your users effectively. Graphic designers put special attention to understand your branding and apply it accordingly.Line art and broken boxLine art is one of the remarkable and versatile choices in terms of designing. From retro pinstriping technique to clean geometric line drawings, designers can do wonder with their artwork. There is an endless array of styles that can be executed with custom management to match your brand tone.Make sure when you choose a broken box pattern, incorporate your brand identity with minimalism and geometric design. It adds an elegant finish to the logo.Besides these trends, many brands transcend the boundaries of contemporary trends and choose something out of the box! If you already have a rough draft about your brand logo, you can incorporate these trends. Now, the choice is yours’.Written bysimple xmepFollowSEOWeb Design CompanyWeb DevelopmentWebsiteWebMore from simple xmepFollowMore From Medium10 Color Palettes from the Natural World to Inspire Your Creative StreakPayman Taei in Design + SketchThe link between Design and M&AMaarten van Hoogdalem in The StartupLooking beyond the hexagons: What does it mean to become an education designer?Laura McBain in Stanford d.schoolThe Design Thinking Approach to BusinessVoltage Control in Voltage ControlCase study: Job Search at Stack OverflowDonna Choi in The StartupShapeoko + EASEL Milling using Meshcam‘s 3D GCodeJessica HoganDesign Principles at TailwindSam Provenza in TailwindBetter Conference DesignMikael Colville-Andersen in The StartupAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Is the Angular JS framework still worth learning?,https://medium.com/@sajjadhussain-11869/is-the-angular-js-framework-still-worth-learning-f7340fee8fdc?source=tag_archive---------51-----------------------,"Web Development,Web Design,Angular,JavaScript,Programming","More and more people are interested in learning to develop and build their own websites. If you are too, then 2018 will be an ideal year to improve your skills. We might as well start with the Java framework, but we will talk more about Angular JS in this article.Angular JS is a web front-end framework written in HTML and Java, which can be used to write a page of Java applications. These applications can be used multiple times or slightly adjusted for future use.Although, we do believe that deciding which Java framework is most suitable in terms of features and usability is an endless dispute. But we recommend learning Java first, then its framework, and learn all of these and try to write your pet projects.Web applications in Angular JS can run more efficiently, because the user interface is dynamically updated by itself and does not rely on server support.To understand whether the Angular JS framework is suitable for learning, please refer to the following elements about it.1. Angular helps manage dependenciesHere we mention a term-dependency injection, SPA (Single Page Web Application) may be the best application scenario. In order to provide a native application experience, SPA temporarily provides dynamic loading time. With many dependencies, the performance of these applications can be improved on different modules and reduce the burden on the server, thus making the application faster and lighter.2. Promote parallel developmentWithin Angular JS, developers can code and test independently without having to enter other environments. With the advent of Angular JS, patterns can be used in development and make JS easier to use.3. No need to write MVC pipelineDevelopers are looking for ways to reduce code lines or reduce code size. Angular JS has eliminated the need to develop an MVC pipeline.4. Data FilterThe filter operates independently and helps to filter the data before it is viewed. Angular JS has many filters, which is why it provides more flexibility. For example, reverse text strings, paging, etc.5. Highly accessible and integratedAngular JS effectively integrates new features and is easy to access. In addition, it also provides a powerful means of maintenance. It takes a lot of time to debug the code at a critical juncture. Of course, developers hope to reduce the time spent in this area. The Angular framework is of great help to this.Written bySajjad HussainDigital NomadFollowWeb DevelopmentWeb DesignAngularJavaScriptProgrammingMore from Sajjad HussainFollowDigital NomadMore From MediumBuilder Pattern in Kotlin: Ditch multiple constructors with numerous paramsAnastasia Finogenova in Dev GeniusHow we create a reusable CTA button with React Hook in Next.jsChia Feng TsaiTest Patterns With React HooksLuis Paredes in TalporBest practices for a clean and performant Angular applicationVamsi Vempati in freeCodeCamp.orgUsing React + Google Sheets as your CMSRyan McNierneySnackbars in React: An Exercise in Hooks and ContextRoman Tymchyk in The StartupWhy Should We Use the JavaScript Class Syntax?John Au-Yeung in The StartupAdvanced Filtering for your Rails 5 ApplicationMaria Schuessler in The StartupAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
HTML5 new features,https://medium.com/@sajjadhussain-11869/html5-new-features-394e42837408?source=tag_archive---------52-----------------------,"Web Development,Web Design,HTML,CSS,Technology","HTML5 is the core language of the World Wide Web, the fifth major revision of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) under the standard universal markup language. In order to adapt to the changes in the entire Internet era, people can build web pages in a better way. HTML5 came into being. HTML5 has added the following features for you:1. Semantic features (Class: Semantic)HTML5 gives web pages better meaning and structure. With the support of RDFa, microdata and microformats, richer tags will build a data-driven Web that is more valuable to programs and users.The semantics of HTML structure has only been proposed in recent years. The previous HTML structure was a bunch of cold tags without semantics. The most widespread is div+css. The previous page is a bunch of div+css when opened. In order to change this situation, developers and officials put forward the concept of semantically making HTML structure, and w3c is also giving HTML5 Several new semantic tags have been introduced.What effect will the document have after semantics? It is the HTML structure you write, which is represented and marked with corresponding English letters (tags) with certain semantics, because HTML itself is a markup language. Not only for myself, it is easy to read and write. It is easy for others to understand your code and structure, and it is easy to read even for people who are not doing web development. .How do you know whether your page structure is semantically based? It depends on the HTML layout structure. After removing the CSS style sheet, whether the code structure of the content can still be presented well. In other words, after removing the CSS decoration, the structure of the entire HTML is still clearly read, and the overall architecture modules can be seen clearly. This is the effect we want HTML documents to achieve after semantics.In fact, semantics is nothing more than choosing the right label in the right scene when you use the label. For example, the h1~h5 series of tags are used to define the title in HTML; and the p tag is used in most cases. For processing text paragraphs, table tables are suitable for information tables, etc.We have the following benefits of semantically standardized operations on the entire HTML structure:1. This is conducive to SEO Establishing good communication with search engines helps crawlers to capture more effective information: crawlers rely on tags to determine the context and the weight of each keyword;2. It is convenient for other devices to parse (such as screen readers, blind readers, mobile devices) to render web pages in a meaningful way;3. It is convenient for team development and maintenance, and semantics are more readable. Teams that follow W3C standards follow this standard, which can reduce differentiation.The new semantic tags in HTML5 have further strengthened our operability for semantic follow-up of the entire HTML structure, making our web page layout more readable.Common HTML5 semantic tags and their usage scenarios are as follows:<article>Define a separate content area of ​​the page.<aside>Define the sidebar content of the page.<command>Define command buttons, such as radio buttons, check boxes, or buttons<details>Used to describe the details of a document or a part of a document<dialog>Define dialog boxes, such as prompt boxes<summary>The label contains the title of the details element<figure>Specify independent streaming content (images, charts, photos, codes, etc.).<figcaption>Define the title of the <figure> element<footer>Define the footer of a section or document.<header>Defines the head area of ​​the document<mark>Define marked text.<meter>Define weights and measures. Only used for metrics with known maximum and minimum values.<nav>Define the part of the navigation link.<progress>Define the progress of any type of task.<section>Define the section (section, section) in the document.<time>Define the date or time.Local storage features (Class: OFFLINE & STORAGE)The web APP developed based on HTML5 has shorter startup time and faster internet speed, all of which benefit from HTML5 APP Cache and local storage function.Earlier, local storage used cookies. However, web storage needs to be more secure and fast. These data will not be stored on the server, but these data are only used for user request website data. It can also store a large amount of data without affecting the performance of the website. Data exists as a key/value pair, and the data of a web page is only allowed to be accessed and used.The two objects that the client stores data are:localStorage-It is used to save the data of the entire website for a long time. The saved data has no expiration time until it is manually removed.sessionStorage-Used to temporarily save the data of the same window (or tab), which will be deleted after closing the window or tab.Regardless of whether it is localStorage or sessionStorage, the available APIs are the same. The following are commonly used (take localStorage as an example):Save data: localStorage.setItem(key,value);Read data: localStorage.getItem(key);Delete a single data: localStorage.removeItem(key);Delete all data: localStorage.clear();Get the key of an index: localStorage.key(index);Connection characteristics (Class: CONNECTIVITY)More effective connection work efficiency enables real-time web-based chat, faster web game experience, and more optimized online communication. HTML5 has more effective server push technology. Server-Sent Event and WebSockets are two of these features. These two features can help us realize the function of the server to “push” data to the client.WebSocket is a protocol that HTML5 began to provide for full-duplex communication on a single TCP connection.WebSocket makes the data exchange between the client and the server easier, allowing the server to actively push data to the client. In the WebSocket API, the browser and the server only need to complete a handshake, and a persistent connection can be created directly between the two, and two-way data transmission can be carried out.In the WebSocket API, the browser and the server only need to do a handshake action, and then a fast channel is formed between the browser and the server. Data can be transferred directly between the two.Nowadays, in order to implement push technology, many websites use Ajax polling. Polling is at a specific time interval (such as every 1 second), the browser sends an HTTP request to the server, and then the server returns the latest data to the client’s browser. This traditional mode brings obvious disadvantages, that is, the browser needs to continuously send requests to the server, but the HTTP request may contain a long header, and the really valid data may be only a small part, which is obviously wasteful. A lot of bandwidth and other resources.The WebSocket protocol defined by HTML5 can better save server resources and bandwidth, and can communicate in more real-time.We use WebSocket and Ajax long polling to compare, so as to feel the advantages of WebSocket, the comparison chart is as follows:Web multimedia features (Class: MULTIMEDIA)It supports multimedia functions such as Audio and Video on the web side, and complements the APPS, camera, and audio-visual functions of the website.The video element is specifically used in HTML5 to play videos or movies on the Internet.The audio element is used exclusively in HTML5 to play audio on the Internet.When using video and audio elements to play, there is no need to use other plug-ins, as long as our browser supports HTML5.Browser supportSafari3 and above, Firefox4 and above, 0pera10 and above, chrome3.0 and above all support audio and video elements!1. Basic usageThe audio element only needs to assign a src attribute to it:<audio src=”MP3.mp3"" controls=”controls”></audio>For browsers that do not support, we can add prompt sentences between the pair of elements instead<audio src=”MP3.mp3"" controls=”controls”>Your browser does not support the Audio element</audio>The length and width and src attributes of the video element should be set:<video width=”750"" height=”400"" src=”time.mp4""></video>Also for browsers that do not support video, you can add alternate text in the middle:<video width=”750"" height=”400"" src=”time.mp4"">Your browser does not support the video element</video>The source element specifies multiple playback formats and encodings:The source element can specify multiple playback formats and encoding methods for the same media data to ensure that the browser can select a playback format that it supports for playback. The selection order is from top to bottom until the supported format is selected.Instructions:<video><source src=”video.m4v” type=”video/mp4"" /><source src=”video.webm” type=”video/webm” /><source src=”video.ogv” type=”video/ogg” /><source src=”video.mp4"" /></video>Support status of encoding format by various devices:Video in webm(.webm) format Firefox 4.0+, chrome6.0+, opera10.6+Video in mp4 (.m4v) format IE9.0+, Safari3.1+, iso5.0, Android4.0+ogg(.ogv) format video Firefox 3.5+, chrome3.0+, opera10.5+Video in mp4 (.mp4) format IE9.0+, Safari3.1+, iso3.0, Android2.3+2. Common attributes of viedo and audioCommon attributes of audio and video elementssrc attribute: Specify the URL address of the media data in this attribute.The controls attribute: Specify whether to add the browser’s own playback control bar for video or audio data. The control bar has buttons such as play button and pause.Width and height attributes (only for video): specify the width and height of the video.autoplay attribute: This attribute specifies whether to start autoplay when our web page is loaded.Preload attribute: This attribute specifies whether to preload the data. If so, the browser will buffer the video data or audio data, which can speed up the playback.Three values ​​of the preload attribute:none means no preloading.metadata means that only the metadata of the media is preloaded.auto (default value) means preload all video or audio.Use the methods provided by Java to operate multimedia.Java provides us with a wealth of methods to control multimedia files flexibly, so that we can define our own multimedia player according to actual project requirements.After the controls attribute is set, a control bar that comes with the browser will be displayed in the interface. If there is no requirement for UI, its built-in controller can already meet most of the needs. Hide the control bar and simulate: The key to implementing a custom function player is that we don’t use the native controller. After hiding it, we use HTML and CSS to simulate the required style at the same position below, and pass js calls the interface functions and attributes exposed to us by the video tag, and detects the user’s operation behavior to synchronize the corresponding changes in the simulated UI and video playback data.The usage of several core functions and attributesmyVid=document.getElementById(“video1”);//Control the video switchmyVid.play() // Trigger the playback of the media filemyVid.pause() //trigger the pause of the media filemyVid.currentTime=5; //Return or set the current video playback positionmyVid.duration // Return the total length of the videomyVid.volume //Control the volumemyVid.muted //Control whether multimedia is mutedThree-dimensional, graphics and special effects characteristics (Class: 3D, Graphics & Effects)Based on the 3D functions of SVG, Canvas, WebGL and CSS3, users will be amazed by the amazing visual effects presented in the browser.<canvas> is an HTML element that can use scripts (usually Java) to draw graphics. For example, it can be used to draw charts, make picture compositions, or make simple (and not so simple) animations. The picture on the right shows Some implementation examples of <canvas>.Using the <canvas> element is not very difficult but you need some basic HTML and Java knowledge. Some outdated browsers do not support the <canvas> element, but all new versions of mainstream browsers support it. The default size of Canvas is 300 pixels × 150 pixels (width × height, the unit of pixel is px). However, you can use the HTML height and width attributes to customize the size of the Canvas. In order to draw graphics on Canvas, we use a Java context object, which can dynamically create graphics (creates graphics on the fly)With the development and application of big data and other fields, canvas drawing plays an important role in data visualization, allowing us to flexibly display data in various forms, improve data readability, and enhance product data capabilities.The following figure shows the application effect of canvas in data visualization:In summary, the emergence of new HTML5 functions has enabled the front-end to play a more powerful role in many new application fields, and has also allowed many existing projects to have better choices in the form of expression.Written bySajjad HussainDigital NomadFollowWeb DevelopmentWeb DesignHTMLCSSTechnologyMore from Sajjad HussainFollowDigital NomadMore From MediumIt’s Your Space–Write Readable Code.Nijin Vinodan in Better ProgrammingWhat are Java code blocks and how to use themTom Henricksen in Data Driven InvestorReset your lost password using Docker and SSHAlex Ellis5 Tricks to Write More Concise Python CodeYong Cui, Ph.D. in Better ProgrammingMonitoring Clojure Ring Apps with Java MelodyIvo Maixner in The StartupA Guide to Get Started With Microservice ArchitectureThe Educative Team in Better ProgrammingOn (Programming) Language DesignTiago Simões in OutSystems EngineeringOur way to Building High-Performance Teams (Part 1)Francisco Lopez Valenzuela in QuantumTalentAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
How can React.js developers practice their skills better?,https://medium.com/@sajjadhussain-11869/how-can-react-js-developers-practice-their-skills-better-797b1425517c?source=tag_archive---------53-----------------------,"React,Web Development,Website,CSS,HTML","ReactJS (Reat for short) is the most popular front-end framework. It is developed by Facebook and has developed rapidly in recent years and has become a standard library based on component GUI development.Although there are other front-end frameworks, such as Angular, Vue.js, etc., React is unique in that it only focuses on component-based GUI development and does not involve other fields. For example, Angular is a complete framework that comes with many features, such as dependency injection, routing system, form processing, HTTP requests, animation, internationalization support, and a strong module system that supports lazy loading.So, if you already have some libraries to complete these functions, or you don’t need all of these functions, then React is a better choice. However, learning React is not easy, especially for those who are just getting started with web development.Basic knowledgeNo matter which framework you learn, these basic knowledge are necessary, namely HTML, CSS and Java, these three are the three pillars of web development.HTMLHTML is the first pillar and the most important skill for web developers. It provides the structure of web pages.CSSCSS is the second pillar of web development and is used to provide beautiful styles to web pages. Learn CSS can refer to this free course.JavaThis is the third pillar of Web development, and interaction is only possible with Java web pages. It is also the foundation of the React framework, so you must master Java before learning React.General development skillsWhether you are a front-end developer or a back-end developer, or even a full-stack engineer, you must understand some general development skills in order to be a fish in the world of programmers.Learning GitAs of 2020, Git is a technology that must be mastered. Try to build a few code repositories on GitHub, share the code with other subs, and learn how to download the code from Github to your IDE.Understand the HTTP(S) protocolIf you want to become a web developer, you must understand and master the HTTP protocol.I am not asking you to read the HTTP standard, but to at least be familiar with common HTTP requests such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS, and the basic working principles of HTTP/HTTPS.Learning terminal commandsAlthough it is not necessary for front-end development to learn Linux or terminal commands, I strongly recommend you to be familiar with terminal commands and configure your shell (such as bash, zsh, csh), etc. If you want to learn terminal commands and bash.Algorithm and data structureThis is also the basic programming skills that React developers do not necessarily need, but it is definitely the only way to become a programmer.Learning design patternsJust like algorithms and data structures, design patterns are not necessary for React developers, but there are many benefits to learning this knowledge.Design patterns are tried and tested solutions to common problems in software development.Learn React.jsFinally entered the topic. You must learn and master React to become a React developer. The best learning material is React’s official website, but for beginners, this may be too complicated.Learn to build toolsIf you want to become a professional React developer, you should spend some time familiarizing yourself with the tools that web developers need to use, such as build tools, unit testing tools, debugging tools, etc.Package managerThere are many package managers, but you don’t need to learn all the tools, you only need to learn npm and webpack. After you have a better understanding of web development and the React ecosystem, you can explore other tools.After learning Bootstrap, you can further learn Materialize or Material UI.State managementAnother important area that React developers need to care about is state management. You must learn below mentioned concepts and frameworks:Component state/context APIReduxAsync action (side effect)If you find it too complicated, I suggest you focus on Redux, it’s pretty good.Class Type inspectorSince Java is not a strongly typed language, there is no compiler that can catch type errors.As the application grows, type checking can catch many errors, especially when you use Java extensions such as Flow or Type.But even if you don’t use these extensions, React also has some built-in type checking functions that can help you find bugs in advance.Form aidsIn addition to the type checker, you can also learn some form auxiliary tools, such as Rdux Form, which can easily manage the state of the form. In addition to Redux Form, you can also look at Formik, Formsy, and Final form.RoutingComponents are the core of React’s powerful descriptive programming model, and routing components are an important part of all applications.React Router provides some navigation components that can define applications in a descriptive manner.If you want to add bookmark able URLs to your application or want to provide navigation in React Native, React Router is essential.In addition to React Router, you can also look at Router 5 and Redux-First Router.API clientNow, people rarely only build APIs, and most of the time they need to communicate with other applications through APIs (such as REST, GraphQL, etc.).Fortunately, many API clients are available to React developers.RESTfetchSuperAgentaxiosGraphQLApolloRelayurqlApollo Client is my favorite client. It provides a simple and easy-to-use way to build client applications with GraphQL. The client is designed to help you quickly build UI and use GraphQL to get data. It can be used in conjunction with any Java front end.Tool LibraryTool library can make your work easier. React developers have many tool libraries to choose from, such as:lodashmomentclassnamesnumeralRxJSRamdaJavin does not recommend learning all these libraries, you can start with lodahs, moments and classnames.TestOne of the techniques that React developers must master is testing. You should pay attention to libraries that help you test.Here are some libraries i mentionedUnit testJestEnzymeSinonMochaChaiAVATapeEnd-to-end testingSeleniumWebdriverCypressPuppeteerCucumber.jsNightwatch.jsIntegration TestingKarmaYou can also learn this library, but it is recommended to learn Jest.GlobalizationAnother important topic of front-end development is internationalization. You need to provide localized GUIs for Japan, China, Spain and other European countries.it’s not wrong to learn more:React IntlReact i18NextAll these libraries provide React components and APIs for formatting dates, numbers and strings, including plural forms, and can also handle translation issues.Server-side renderingYou may not know the difference between server-side rendering and client-side rendering. Let’s take a look at this problem first, and then discuss which server-side rendering libraries can be used in React.In client-side rendering, the browser will download the minimum amount of HTML, then load Java, and fill in the HTML.In server-side rendering, React will execute on the server, output HTML and send it directly to the browser.It is recommended to the learning the following server-side rendering libraries:Next.jsAfter.jsRogueStatic website generationGatsby.js is a modern static website generator. Use Gatsby to create a personalized website that supports login. It can combine data with Java to generate beautiful HTML content.Back-end framework inheritanceReact on Rails can integrate React with Rails. It can provide server-side rendering, SEO crawler indexing and UX performance that rails/webpacker cannot provide.Mobile ApplicationsThis is another benefit of learning React, because React Native is rapidly becoming the standard way to develop mobile applications. You can develop native interfaces using Java.I suggests you that you learn the following techniquesReact NativeCordovaPhoneGapDesktop applicationThere are also some React-based frameworks that can build desktop GUIs, such as React Native Windows, which can use React to build native UWP and WPF applications.The proposed framework is as follows:ProtonNativeElectronReact NativeWindowsBut these are advanced features. You can come and learn after you have mastered React.Virtual RealityIf you are interested in virtual reality applications, you can take a look at frameworks such as React 360, which all provide a very good VR experience through React.Written bySajjad HussainDigital NomadFollowReactWeb DevelopmentWebsiteCSSHTMLMore from Sajjad HussainFollowDigital NomadMore From MediumHow to Make Your Very First Chrome ExtensionFerenc Almasi in JavaScript In Plain EnglishReact forms controlled & uncontrolled componentsAlex Lobera in LeanJSclickOutside using useRef hooksPaul HoAngular: One Hell Of A StripeLucio Francisco in Wizdm GenesysSEARCHing for Love with ReactCaroline GlassA React Hook You Don’t NeedMichael McShinsky in The StartupNode.JS Module System Part 1 (Note-Taking App)Musta in The StartupBuild an App With Live Reloading Using Express and WebpackNicholas Martin in Better ProgrammingAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

It’s the center of inbound marketing strategies. The main thing your target audience will explore is your website before deciding to do business with you. Most modern brands understand the value of a website hence they are investing more to improve theirs. They are becoming faster, mobile-friendly, sleeker, and increasingly useful. This is great from the consumer's point of view. Yet makes a marketer’s responsibility even heavier.To stand up to competitors in the cutthroat Dubai industry it is essential for all businesses to engage in a website redesign. The cost of it varies vastly from being as low as a few hundred AED to really expensive rates for customized designs. To give companies an idea of what to expect we have put together all the necessary details in this article.The Cost Of Doing Web Redesign YourselfDoing it yourself is of course the cheapest solution we have here. It can take anywhere from several hundred AED to 3,000 AED or above. Apart from the money, it basically requires a good amount of time and hassle to design or redesign a website. And in general, the less money spent on it, the more issues there will be to get the website as you wish.For small start-ups, platforms like ThemeForest are extremely helpful. They afford tons of affordable themes, that usually range around $30 to $100. Make sure that you pick a theme that has the most positive reviews. It should also be easy to edit without the need for technical expertise.The Genesis Framework is also another popular option that allows you to create content and visually edit your site. If you have a bigger budget then HubSpot’s Website Platform is ideal too.The Cost Of Hiring A Web Redesign FreelancerAn experienced professional designer can charge anything from 2,000 to 5,000 AED. Those charges are for simple web design. A more elaborate and custom-featured project will cost you 10,000 to 15,000 AED. However, these price rates can vary from one designer to another.Working with a freelancer, will get your website to look incredible and without any major functional flaws. They will listen to your ideas first. Then build some mock-ups for your approval. The final design will be based on the one you like the best.The downside of this solution though is that it can be a hit or miss kind of situation. When it comes to freelancer designers, the job takes longer as they are doing it entirely on their own. Furthermore, you are not likely to et any insight you might need outside of designing.The Cost Of Hiring A Web Redesign AgencyThe option of choosing a design agency is the ideal solution of all. As this gets you much more value for the price you pay. But keep in mind that it is also the most expensive option.A simple website redesigning can cost 15,000–20,000 AED. While bigger and complex features will cost around 20,000–40,000 AED. When you work with a design agency it goes beyond handling just that. They will also provide you customized features and makes it look as flawless as possible.Apart from aesthetics a design agency focuses on content, conversation rate optimization, and enhances user experience. They basically see every aspect of your website to make it the most valuable asset for your brand.The difference between freelancers and agencies is that they have a careful strategy-driven approach. That is invested to build an effective and powerful business generating machine for your company. Moreover, they have more a greater number of resources than a freelancer. Such as experts of different areas in design, content development, and other tools of the process.Give Attention To Content DesignContent is the most essential part of web redesign. It is also the thing that takes the most hours. The most appropriate approach is a content-first design. This means that your website is built around the content instead of the other way round. A website cannot run on design alone. The content is the basic thing that delivers your ideas and values to the audience.Discuss About The ContentWhen doing web redesigning by yourself, start by planning out all the pages you want to be on your website. Then proceed to write the content you to go with them.If working with a freelancer, know what their process of content creation is. Some web designers offer to do the content, but usually its not a good option. It is rare for a designer to be good at both.The benefit of hiring a design agency is that they usually include content as a part of their services. There have experienced content marketers that help in that feature.Here end the cost guidelines and useful recommendations we have for you for the web designing industry in Dubai.

HTML5 and web front end,https://medium.com/@sajjadhussain-11869/html5-and-web-front-end-d2e47f4a5736?source=tag_archive---------55-----------------------,"Web Development,Web,Web Design,Website,Technology","Speaking of web front-end, we may think of HTML5 subconsciously, but in fact, HTML5 and front-end are not the same thing, so what is the relationship between HTML5 and web front-end?What is HTML5?HTML5 is the latest standard of HTML, and it is the fifth major revision of the application of HTML under the standard universal markup language, which is the core of Web program development. Although Java, CSS3 and HTML5 are different languages, HTML5 generally refers to HTML5, CSS3, and Java because they are often used together. This is why people often think that the web front end is HTML5.What is web front-end development?In the traditional sense, a website is divided into a front-end and a back-end. The front-end is the page commonly known as the page and various display effects that users often see when browsing.Front-end development is the process of creating front-end interfaces such as web pages or apps and presenting them to users. The user interface interaction of Internet products is realized through HTML, CSS, Java and various derived technologies, frameworks, and solutions. It evolved from the production of web pages, and its name has obvious characteristics of the times. In the evolution of the Internet, web page production was a product of the Web1.0 era. The main content of early websites was static, mainly pictures and text, and the behavior of users using the website was also mainly browsing. With the development of Internet technology and the application of HTML5 and CSS3, modern web pages are more beautiful, interactive and more powerful.The relationship between HTML5 and Web front-end developmentNow HTML5 is no longer just a markup language. It provides a new framework and platform for the next generation of Web, including providing plug-in-free videos, image animations, ontology storage, and more cool and important functions, and standardizing these applications , So that the Web can easily achieve a desktop-like application experience.For web front-end developers, HTML5’s rich tag system, similar to the built-in shortcut keys, will replace those plug-ins that complete relatively simple tasks, and can lower the technical threshold of application development. And for companies, HTML5 can change the mode and distribution of corporate online advertising, help traditional corporate IT applications mobilize, and help companies build application platforms.Strictly speaking, HTML5 and Web front-end technology are a subordinate relationship. HTML5 is a part of front-end Web development, but the technologies involved in Web development are very broad. In addition to HTML5, you also need to learn other technologies such as CSS, div, Java, jQuery, website performance optimization, SEO, PHP basics and server-side basics.Written bySajjad HussainDigital NomadFollowWeb DevelopmentWebWeb DesignWebsiteTechnologyMore from Sajjad HussainFollowDigital NomadMore From MediumError Handling in Combine ExplainedAntoine van der lee 🇳🇱 in Better ProgrammingBuilding a Chip-8 Emulator in GoBradford Lamson-ScribnerHandling CPU Limits & CPU Requests In Kubernetes: Part 2@pramodAIML in SysopsMicroA Beta to Help You Create a Data and AI Platform on Your TermsSteven Astorino in Inside Machine learningTutorial — using Python’s “unsync” library to make an asynchronous trading botMatt Gosden3 Reasons Why You Should Almost Always Use sorted() in PythonYong Cui, Ph.D. in The StartupThe 7 Habits of Highly Effective Self-Taught DevelopersAnn Adaya in Better ProgrammingWhile Loops in SwiftSteven Curtis in The StartupAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
HTML5 Tutorial DIV+CSS Webpage Standardized Layout Advantages,https://medium.com/@sajjadhussain-11869/html5-tutorial-div-css-webpage-standardized-layout-advantages-da6dfc551e8f?source=tag_archive---------56-----------------------,"Web Development,Web Design,HTML,Technology,CSS","Standard web pages all need to lay out the content. In the past, the positioning technology of tables was used. Since 2005, the layout method of DIV+CSS has been gradually shifted. At present, most websites adopt this layout method. The use of DIV+CSS to layout the website complies with the W3C standard. The layout in this way is usually used to illustrate the difference between the positioning method and the HTML table. By using the DIV box model structure, each part of the content is divided into different blocks, and then CSS is used to define the position, size, border, inner and outer margins, and arrangement of the box model. Simply put, DIV is used to build website structure (framework), and CSS is used to create website presentation (style/beautification). This standard simplifies the HTML page code and obtains a better website structure, which is conducive to future website maintenance, collaborative work and easy search engine crawling. Of course, not all web pages need to use DIV layout, such as data pages, reports and other pages, or it is more convenient to use HTML tables. The Web standard does not say that Tables should be abandoned.Advantages of DIV+CSS for page layoutDIV+CSS is a web page layout method. In the HTML website design standard, table positioning technology is no longer used, but DIV+CSS is used to achieve various positioning. DIV+CSS is one of the commonly used terms in website standards (also called “Web standards”), which can separate the content and performance of web pages. The use of DIV+CSS to construct websites is increasingly valued by web designers. Because in the DIV+CSS structured webpage, almost every element’s attributes are defined using CSS, so it is useful for the adjustment of webpage areas and elements. Great effect. This DIV+CSS model website design has the following advantages.1. Separation of performance and contentOnly the text information is stored in the HTML file, and the design part is placed in a separate style file, so that we can exert more control over the layout of the page, and the HTML code can still remain simple and clear.2. Concise code, improve page browsing speedThe great advantage of CSS lies in its concise code. For a large-scale website, it can not only save a lot of bandwidth and increase the browsing speed of the page, but also increase the proportion of effective keywords in the total code of the page. Therefore, a website made using the DIV+CSS Web standard has certain advantages for search engines to crawl pages.3. Easy to maintain and reviseThe separation of web content and design style reduces some repetitive construction methods and makes page and style adjustments more convenient. As long as you simply modify a few CSS files, you can redesign the entire website page. Many problems only need to change the CSS without changing the program, thus reducing the cost of website revision.4. Improve search engine indexing efficiency of web pagesA website built using the DIV+CSS method is easy to move closer to the W3C standard, because whether the website conforms to the W3C standard is an influencing factor of the search engine’s ranking of the page. In addition, the source code of the website is concise. Except for a few tags such as div, span, ul, li, there are almost no other tags, and the use of DIV+CSS can put the main content of the web page in front. In this way, the content of the website is completely exposed in front of search engines, making it easy for search engines to grab key contentWritten bySajjad HussainDigital NomadFollowWeb DevelopmentWeb DesignHTMLTechnologyCSSMore from Sajjad HussainFollowDigital NomadMore From MediumHow to estimate an app cost as a freelancerSatya Pavan Kantamani in Programming GeeksAll about OpenCV built-in functionsSadman Kabir Soumik in The StartupIs good code style always subjective?Bayrhammer KlausSorry, If-Else Statements Aren’t Bad at AllAnupam Chugh in Better ProgrammingReconnecting with the Art of CodingMynah Marie in Earth To AbigailUnderstanding SQL InjectionsScott CosentinoAutomate Tasks in Rails Using the Whenever GemAlexandra Radevich in The StartupMagento 2 PWA Studio and GraphQL PerformanceYegor Shytikov in The StartupAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
"The relationship between HTML5 and HTML, css, JavaScript",https://medium.com/@sajjadhussain-11869/the-relationship-between-html5-and-html-css-javascript-430e34d294c?source=tag_archive---------57-----------------------,"Web Development,Web Design,HTML,CSS,Technology","Recently I started to learn HTML5, and I have mastered some knowledge of HTML and css, but this does not allow us to learn a user-interactive interface. The second stage is learning, which is used to control the control and the user to interact. To use the metaphor of building a building, HTML knowledge has been framed, and CSS has been refined. Java is the property management of the community and is responsible for communicating with the residents of the community.Our principle of writing pages is that we can use CSS to implement it without js. This is because the implementation speed of CSS is much higher than that of js. But in some cases we have to use js. For example, when the page jumps with parameters, we can implement it through the localtion object of the window object. For another example, we need to load the product list page, and the effect of writing as static is obviously not up to the requirement.Because we don’t know how much data there is, the end of this time can help us solve this problem perfectly. To request json data through js’s ajax, you don’t need to consider how much data there is, just set up the structure and framework, and use the for loop to inject the data into the east gate node.In the actual development of the project, we will use multiple pages and various resources. It is more troublesome to manage by ourselves. At this time, it is very convenient to use the third-party module gulp of node.js. We only need to configure it at the beginning gulpfile, js can write projects smoothly. The second stage is a very important stage, because the knowledge of the third stage is expanded on the second stage. For example, the grammar, deconstruction and arrow functions of es6 in the secondary segment, and the new grammar of es6 strings. These are often used in the three stages. Only by laying a solid foundation can you be able to do well in the subsequent learning.Written bySajjad HussainDigital NomadFollowWeb DevelopmentWeb DesignHTMLCSSTechnologyMore from Sajjad HussainFollowDigital NomadMore From MediumSnapchat Coding Interview QuestionsTrung Anh Dang in JavaScript In Plain EnglishUsing JavaScript Setsgravity well (Rob Tomlin) in JavaScript In Plain EnglishCreate a COVID-19 Dashboard with JavaScriptVarun Joshi in The StartupUnderstanding Pure function in JavascriptMichael Tong in Weekly WebtipsBuilding a currency ticker with NodeJS and Socket.ioAkhilesh Srivastava in Weekly WebtipsMultiple ways to implement react.js and react-native applications.Siddharth Shingate, Sr. Software Engineer,CoReCo. in The StartupBefore You ReactManusha Chethiyawardhana in Frontend WeeklyLazy Loading Images Made Easy in JavaScriptAdrien Miquel in Better ProgrammingAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Possibly the simplest HTML explanation that exists.,https://medium.com/@GreggorMetoande/possibly-the-simplest-html-explanation-that-exists-c1d5e2bf17fe?source=tag_archive---------58-----------------------,"HTML,Web Development,Web Design,Career Change,Learning To Code","Photo by Irvan Smith, available on unsplash.comOK, HTML. So what is it used for?In short, HTML is what you use to add content to a web site and to label, group, and link that content meaningfully.So what is HTML not used for?HTML is not used to manipulate how the content on a web site looks. This includes things like the type and size of font, the colour of the background, or the layout of content on a page.(A different language called Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to apply style and alter the visual representation of a web page’s content.)And, how does HTML work?HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. The two key components here being Hyper Text because it links between content (possibly the most important feature of the world wide web) and Markup because it literally marks up or labels content so it can be better understood, both by humans and computers.HTML is formed by placing tags with pre-defined meanings around the content that you wish to display on your web site. Some content along with the tags that enclose it is known as an element. In turn, a web page is comprised of many elements.HTML, is written in a simple text document, saved with a .html file extension. A web browser, say Mozilla or Chrome, is capable of reading these HTML files and renders these elements on the screen for your audience to view.It is useful to note that HTML files can themselves reference other locations. For example, you don’t put an actual image in an HTML file. Instead, you place a link to where this image can be found. When the browser gets to an image element in the HTML file, it goes to the address that you include in the element, gets the image, and displays it on the web page.So, how do elements and tags look?There are opening and closing tags and they respectively open and close elements. An opening tag starts with a < and ends with a >. For example, <h1> is a top-level heading tag; <h2> is a second level heading tag; <p> is a paragraph tag; <nav> is a tag used to indicate a section of navigation links.A closing tag starts with a </ and ends with a >. So, you would close the top-level header tag with </h1>. Putting this together, a top-level header element might look like this:<h1>Possibly the simplest HTML explanation that exists</h1>And a paragraph element might look like this:<p>This article explains what HTML is and how it is used in a manner that aims to be understood by all.</p>There are many HTML tags and they are updated every now and again so the labels (the tags) can be as accurate and meaningful as possible. The most recent version of HTML is HTML5 and you can easily find the most up-to-date list online.It’s important to note that a number of elements don’t have both an opening and closing tag, but just an opening tag. They are known as ‘self closing’ elements or tags. The <img> element, used to reference images in an HTML file, is one of these.It’s also useful to note that elements can have attributes. There are many of these and they provide additional information about an element. They are placed in the opening tag of an element. For example, the ‘href’ link attribute includes the actual address where the link leads to. For example:<a href=”https://www.medium.com”>Click here to go to Medium</a>.Great, and how do the different elements fit together?When a web browser renders an HTML file — that is, when it displays a web page on your screen — it starts at the top of the HTML file and reads to the bottom. As it does this, it places each element it comes across in the HTML file on the browser window.In many ways it is useful to think of elements as different types of boxes, with specific labels on them, that automatically resize to fit their contents. You can stack the boxes and you can even places boxes inside of other boxes. This is called nesting. You can even nest elements several layers deep, a bit like Russian dolls.In the absence of CSS, which can manipulate the layout of content in the browser window, the elements are placed according to three factors.First, the position of the element in the HTML file. The browser reads from top to bottom and places the elements on the screen as it reads them, one after the other.Second, the display type of the element. An element type is inherently either block or inline. <h1> is a block element, for example; <span> is an inline element. A block element occupies the whole width of the element it is contained within (all elements are as a minimum contained within the initial box, the <html> box that starts and closes every html file). This means two block elements cannot be on the same line (unless you change their display type with CSS). An inline element occupies only the space between the tags and does not automatically force a new line.Third, the direction of the language (think English vs Arabic, not Java vs JavaScript) that is set in the HTML file. If English, elements are added by the browser from left to right; if Arabic, from right to left.In the diagram below, various types of elements have been given a border to indicate the structure and box-like nature of HTML as well as how the elements relate to each other.an example html outline diagramIn the diagram you can see how:the block elements fill the width of the elements that contain them (known as parent elements);the inline elements (indicated with dotted red borders) fill only the space occupied by their content;elements nest inside each other, like boxes inside boxes;inline elements populate the space from the left (see the image boxes).OK, and is it important to label the boxes correctly?A web browser can still display a lot of the content if it is incorrectly marked up, but endeavouring to use the correct tags for content is very useful as it makes understanding the content easier for both humans and computers much easier.This helps search engines to more accurately index the content and to offer it to people who are looking for it. This is good for getting your content found and put in front of the right people. For example, the content inside the <h1> tags is quite likely a good indicator of the topic of a web page. Search engines like Google use this, along with other factors, to search and serve web content.Importantly, using the correct HTML tags also helps make web pages more accessible for people with disabilities, such as those using screen readers to access content.Anything else I should know?There are a huge number of things this article does not cover. You just have to read more. But hopefully you now have a better high-level overview of how HTML works.Written byGreggor MetoandeOvercoming a fear of public displays of writing (PDW) while teaching myself coding and hoping to make a career transition.FollowHTMLWeb DevelopmentWeb DesignCareer ChangeLearning To CodeMore from Greggor MetoandeFollowOvercoming a fear of public displays of writing (PDW) while teaching myself coding and hoping to make a career transition.More From MediumMagic Python: mixing magicsLars van Gemerden in The StartupMakefiles 101: how to use make as a task automation toolAlex Nadalin in freeCodeCamp.orgProgramming Habits for Good ProgrammersJohn Au-Yeung in The Startup“Hello, World!” in Different Programming Languages and TimesKesk -*- in The StartupHow to Comment a DeployGate Link for Each Build Version on GitHub Pull Requests With BitriseIchiro Hirata in Better ProgrammingA Better PID AlgorithmFábio MolinarWhen Chrome Blocks Your CookiesCaleb in The StartupIstio & JWT: Step by Step Guide for Micro-Services AuthenticationImran in intelligentmachinesAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
HTML5 front-end tutorial css compatibility,https://medium.com/@sajjadhussain-11869/html5-front-end-tutorial-css-compatibility-299c8ffab26f?source=tag_archive---------59-----------------------,"HTML,Web Development,Web Design,CSS,Technology","What is compatibility?The same HTML+CSS+JS, but the external features displayed still cannot be unified, and there are flaws. With the same code, some browsers display “normal” and some display “abnormal”. Just like going to food stalls, some people have nothing to do after eating, while some people will have diarrhea.2. Why does the browser have compatibility issues?The core architectures used by different manufacturers are different and the codes are difficult to overlap, and the implementation methods are also different. Therefore, the styles presented on the page will also have some differences, which may seem to be different.3. Ideas for handling compatibility issues:1): Do you want to do it? (Look at the degree of influence of the product, the audience, is it the main effect or the basic function)2): To what extent? (If you want those browsers to support, just make those browsers compatible)3): How to do it? (According to compatibility issues, choose those frameworks and those compatible tools.)4.Progressive enhancement and graceful degradation1): Progressive enhancement: The basic functions and pages are now carried out for the lower version browsers, and the effects, interaction, and user experience are improved for the higher version browsers.2): Graceful degradation: At the beginning, a complete page display (effect, interaction, function, user experience) is performed for the higher version browser, and then the lower version browser is compatible5.Common compatibility issuesHigh collapseThe parent element of the floating element is adaptive (when the parent element does not write the height, after the child element writes the float), the height of the parent element will collapseSolution1): Add a declaration to the parent element: overflow: hidden;2): Add an empty div below the floating element. And declare to the element, clera: both; height: 0; overflow: hidden;Minimum height adaptation (because min-heigh itself is an incompatible css attribute, so all browsers are not compatible)1): min-height: value; -height: value2): min-height: value; heigth: auto! Important; height: valueThe button element size is different1): Uniform size for buttons2): Set a label outside, remove the input border and background in the label and button stylePictures have spacing by default (when several img tags are put together, some browsers will have default spacing)1); add float attribute to imgThere will be a gap under the ie6 picture1): Set display for the picture; block;Transparency below ie8filler: alpha (value range 0–100) For example: filter: alpha (opacity=60)The default line height of an empty div (an empty div will be used when clearing the float, which is no problem in most browsers, in ie6 there will be a default line height even if the div is empty)1) Set its height to 0, and set overflow: hidden.6. Some compatibility-related tools and libraries1) html5shiv: Used to solve the problem that browsers below IE9 do not recognize the new HTML5 tags and cause CSS to not work.2) Respond.js: is a fast and lightweight polyfill used to provide min-width and max-width features of media queries for IE6–8 and other browsers that do not support CSS3 Media Queries, to achieve responsive web design3) CSS Reset: Reset the browser’s css default properties; if the browser is different, the interpretation of the default style is different, and the display can be consistent with reset.4) normalize.css: is a customizable CSS file, which allows different browsers to render web page elements in a more uniform form.5) Modernizr.js: Traditional browsers will not be completely replaced at present, making it difficult for you to embed the latest CSS3 or HTML5 features into your website. Modernizr was born to solve this problem. It can also simulate functions that are not supported by older browsers by loading custom scripts.Written bySajjad HussainDigital NomadFollowHTMLWeb DevelopmentWeb DesignCSSTechnologyMore from Sajjad HussainFollowDigital NomadMore From MediumLearn Node.js by building a Timestamp Microservice appAyo Isaiah in freeCodeCamp.orgZK Poker — A Simple ZK-SNARK CircuitGeoff Lamperd in CoinmonksVisual Music: What to Learn from Bellagio’s FountainsSean Zhai in JavaScript In Plain EnglishExploit React Error Boundaries to Improve UXJim Medlock in ChinguIntroduction to Vue.js TemplatesJohn Au-Yeung in JavaScript In Plain EnglishHow to draw gears in WebGLAral Roca GomezIntersection Types and JavaScript Type Checking With FlowJohn Au-Yeung in Better ProgrammingHow to Create Responsive Layout with Vue SlotsJohn Au-Yeung in DataSeriesAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

What is Drop Shipping?-codesquarry-Pvt.-Ltd.,https://medium.com/@codesquarry/what-is-drop-shipping-codesquarry-pvt-ltd-b6e65ae10f39?source=tag_archive---------61-----------------------,"Mobile App Development,Web Development,Android App Development,Ecommerce Web Development,iOS App Development","What is drop shipping?.The biggest difference between “drop shipping” and standard online retail, is that with drop shipping, the store doesn’t keep the products it sells in stock. Instead, when a store sells a product, it buys it from a third party who then ship it directly to the customer. This means that you, as the store, will never see or handle the product. This method has a number of positives and negatives. Positives include that it is relatively quick and easy to get started as you don’t have the added headache of managing stock and shipping. Another benefit is that you can stock a wide range of products. But, drop shipping typically has low margins and you face high competition.How much budget should I allocate to get my web shop up and running?Creating and running an online shop costs money, there is no point in beating around the bush with this one. Just like opening a physical store, you will have outgoing costs including buying the web domain, hosting, web health insurance, plus the cost to design and program the shop.Once you have your new online shop, to forget marketing would be a critical error. It is simply not enough to have a website, you must invest in marketing to gain a brand awareness, to drive traffic and encourage sales. In terms of a budget, allocate at least the same as the cost for the initial set up, if not more.Do I really need to have a social media presence for my business?Combining social media with web shopping is a match made in heaven and it is an effective strategy for e-commerce businesses. According to a study from Smart Insights, over half of companies using social media marketing find it increases revenue and the sales of their products.Further to boosting profits, social media allows brands the opportunity to engage with their customers and get feedback on the products.

Redux Flow,https://medium.com/@listentoripley/redux-7e44ab5525fc?source=tag_archive---------62-----------------------,"Austin Coding Academy,Coding,Web Development,Coding Bootcamp Students","Discuss in words something you learned in class today or this week.Reducers are pure functions are meant to support your state object design.2. What are “actions” in Redux?It’s the “outline” of functionality you want your code to conduct. These will consist of an function containing a set of key value parts, usually two, a “type”, the description of your action and a value, also referred to as the “payload”. The payload is the information you will be referring to later on.3. What is the role of reducers in Redux?It details how your state will change, this is where your functional code is written relating to the action your previously outlined. These functions will include switch statements referring to various types outlined in the actions. You will need return a new state in most cases. It should be noted as well that you should also create a copy of the previous state, not mutate it.4. What is the meaning of “single source of truth” in Redux?It means you are no longer replying on multiple states within each single component, your have a centralized context to depend on.5. Explain the components of Redux.Two are explained above, the Action and Reducer.You also have Store and State. The Store, hold the state of your app, usually the initial state, but this should never be modified.The State, is the facilitator between the store and reducer, it allows for the two to talk to one also. It is also often where you will apply any middleware you have to apply to your dispatch or other elements effected within your reducer/store.6.

Pseudoclassical Instantiation,https://medium.com/@chanceknguyen/pseudoclassical-instantiation-1a3caa024dd3?source=tag_archive---------64-----------------------,"Coding,Web Development,JavaScript,Javascript Tips","Pseudoclassical Instantiation in JavaScript is a way to write JavaScript with a focus on object oriented programming. This is handy to utilize because it allows for easier conceptualization of what your objects are creating and allows easier reusability of code. When I initially started learning JavaScript, I started with writing my code in almost a completely Functional way. Personally, it took a bit of rearranging how I thought about code to adjust to pseudoclassical instantiation, but it has definitely been a worthwhile transition.For my example, let’s imagine that we want to create a function that creates Dog Objects. We definitely could create different functions for different breeds of dogs.var corgi = function () {…}var chihuahua = function() {…}var dachshund = function() {…}If we did that, we would ultimately end up writing a lot of the same code over and over again. Wouldn’t it be beneficial if we create one main object that all of the dog breed functions were based off? Good news! That is exactly what we are going to do!Since all of the different dog breeds are all dogs, and all of these dogs share certain features, we can create a base class for dogs that contain all of the shared properties. For our purposes, we know that all dogs will have a name, all dogs will have a color, and all dogs will get the zoomies.var Dog = function(name, color) {  this.name = name,  this.color = color}Dog.prototype.zoomies = function () {  return this.name + ' is running around!'}var myDog = new Dog('Toby', 'black');Let’s go over what we just wrote!Starting off, we instantiate our variable of ‘Dog’ with a capital letter because it is considered best practice so that we can identify this as a class. When instantiating in the pseudoclassical style you may have noticed that we never created an object, nor did we return anything, so how can we create a new dog with this function? There’s some interesting actions going on under the hood, when we utilize that special ‘new’ keyword. When the ‘new’ keyword is used, JS knows to add in some special lines of code. Let’s take a look at what it is doing.var Dog = function(name, color) { this = Object.create(Dog.prototype) this.name = name, this.color = color return this;};Pay attention to the highlighted lines of codes. That is essentially happening automatically when we utilize the ‘new’ keyword.Next, let’s focus on what is happening inside of our class creation. { this.name = name, this.bark = color};All of the properties that we want associated with our Dog will be created here. Remember, when we created our Dog class, we made it so that the parameters include a name and a color. So when we invoke the function to instantiate a new dog:var myDog = new Dog(‘Toby’, 'black');We are setting the name property to be “Toby” and the color property to be “black. If we want to access those properties and see what they are in relation to our dog, we can access them by writingmyDog.name // ""Toby""myDog.color // ""Black""The last thing we did was create a function that indicates our dog has the zoomies. This is known as a method.Dog.prototype.zoomies = function () {  return this.name + ' is running around!'}You may be asking yourself “What is prototype?”. That is a very valid question and was something that I had much confusion about as well initially! Let’s keep in mind that our Dog class is still a function at it’s core. All functions in Javascript has a special property known as prototype. This prototype property is essentially just an object that the function can utilize. If you’re wondering why we attached the method to the prototype rather than adding it to the initial construction of the function, don’t worry, I had that same line of thought. There are a few different reasons, but let me focus in on the main ones for now. First, we save memory by attaching the method to the prototype. This method is stored in one place in memory. All created instances of Dog have access to the prototype and reference it as necessary. Properties in the construction, on the other hand, are created for every instance of Dog that is created, as opposed to just referencing the method on the prototype. Second, it makes it easier to pass on to subclasses and manipulate and change if necessary at that time.That’s it! We have successfully created a class that allows us to use that same code to create multiple dog objects! We did it all using the pseudoclassical instantiation pattern. In my next article, we will take a deeper dive into subclasses.Thanks for reading!

"What is the difference between DIV, CSS3 and html5, CSS3",https://medium.com/@sajjadhussain-11869/what-is-the-difference-between-div-css3-and-html5-css3-96964bdc15d?source=tag_archive---------66-----------------------,"Web Development,Web Design,Website,HTML,Technology","First of all, whether it is DIV+CSS3 or html5+CSS3, they are our collective name for the layout of web page development, but the sentence of DIV+CSS3 as the basic development of web pages is actually not rigorous, because div is only one of HTML. It’s just an element, and the standard name should be HTML+CSS. What we want to compare is actually the difference between html+css3 and html5+css3 in layout development!In the past, we used html+css mainly to develop the basic parts of PC-side web pages. Most of the business logic and code were on the server side. The front end only received the HTML dynamically generated by the server side and additional simple JS/CSS. /img, is a very unbalanced architecture, and HTML5 on the surface is a label change, but in fact it should be the impact of changing these labels, and there is more to put business logic and calculations on With the addition of the client, HTML has more advantages in APP development.The advantages of HTML5 in APP development are:1. Better semanticsThe previous html+css3 web page construction did not have a clear division of web page structure, and mainly emphasized block elements and inline elements. These two HTM element concepts are literally deeply related to CSS styles, and this connection is contrary The core concept of separation of performance and style has been advocated in the Web specification. And html5+CSS3 adds new structural tags such as header, nav, footer, etc., to make the structure of the web page clearer, and to dilute the two categories of block elements and inline elements, so that we can more clearly understand what each piece of content is. Conducive to search engine analysis and SEO optimization.2. Better access to resourcesThe previous html+css3 web page was built, html could not access the memory. If you want to access the file system disk operation, you also need to rely on flash. If you want to place something in the browser’s memory, only cookies, and the amount of storage is small, but now we can use html5 Many new APIs can call camera, GPS, Bluetooth, store in offline database and many other powerful functions.3. Ability to deploy, distribute, and upgrade independentlyThe current front-end development of html5 can be deployed independently from the server side, and can even be placed on a CDN. The browser can load the front-end APP first, and then let the front-end APP communicate with the server.Let’s summarize, html and css development can only do the basic construction of some web pages. Like many people who wrote pages before, or they were artists or server-side people, the location is very awkward, and now HTML5 and CSS3 are not only based on the previous Optimized its structure and has unique advantages in mobile APP development.Written bySajjad HussainDigital NomadFollowWeb DevelopmentWeb DesignWebsiteHTMLTechnologyMore from Sajjad HussainFollowDigital NomadMore From MediumHow to Python: The BasicsJohn Kundycki in The StartupWhy it’s a good idea for beginner developers to start contributing to open source projects right…Rafael Cascalho in The StartupMoving Data with Apache Sqoop in Google Cloud DataprocDaniel De Leo in Google Cloud - CommunityDjango and Isolation (Part 1)Aditya N in The StartupBuilding AES-128 from the ground up with pythonHenrique Marcomini in Wavy Product & EngineeringUnderstanding numpy data typesDaniel StojanovOpen software needs a new manifestoFabien Imbault, PhDVarnish GeoIPDanila VershininAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

Coding Sins: Hilarious Developer Confessions,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/coding-sins-hilarious-developer-confessions-f55eb342454e?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Software Development,Tech,Startup","Pic credits — PinterestIn the year 2017, David Heinemeier Hansson, a well-known programmer and the creator of the popular Ruby on Rails coding framework, started a Developer Confessions thread on Twitter with this post:In no time, it went viral. He ranted about interview practices in large companies — kicked off a number of tweets across many technical professions.Consensus being:Riddles are bullshit, whiteboard challenges are not relevant to our actual skills and day-to-day work.Being a software engineer myself, to some extent I concur with David.Famous coding instructor Quincy Larson wrote in a blog post:“The only world where you would actually need to be able to recall an algorithm would be a post-apocalyptic one, where the hard drives of all the computers connected to the internet were fried, and all copies of foundational academic papers and computer science textbooks had been reduced to ashes”In this post, I’m going to cover the hilarious confessions of the programmers as tweets.Tim Dierks, a Lead at Google wrote this:While the veracity of whiteboard interviews is still debatable — people think that whiteboard interviewing is a discrete skill, much like being able to remember Pi to a thousand decimal places, Aline Lerner, the Founder of interviewing.io once said — “After drawing on data from thousands of technical interviews, it’s become clear to us that technical interviewing is a process whose results are nondeterministic and often arbitrary”.Sarah Mei posted a series of tweets:Four Square has publicly ditched whiteboard interviews in favor of take-home assignments.We were concerned that [the whiteboard interview] process filtered out many other great engineers for reasons other than their abilities. Some possible reasons include variation between interviewers, candidate nervousness, or the unnaturalness of whiteboard coding generally.As a result, Four Square has gotten rid of the random false negatives that can result from the “algorithm question lottery.To conclude, most of the companies now rely on the pair-programming-centric interview to weed out bad candidates.

Add loading To UI element in Angular like a pro.,https://medium.com/@__bangash/add-loading-to-ui-element-in-angular-like-a-pro-cab59ebe8c93?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Angular,JavaScript,Angularjs,Angular Directive,Web Development","I just want to share my experience by showing the loader on the web app, when HTTP requests or any async processes are calling.Last month our UI/UX team decided to show the loader on the button instead of showing a progress bar on top of the page and also our QA team reported bugs about preventing the users from the double click.The following problems need to be resolved.Restrict the user from the double click.show some state on UI (Button) element so the user knows the button is pressed like the loader or changes the color.handling multiple buttons on the same view.if the request succeeded than make a UI element green otherwise make it red for error.In the current project, we have hundreds of components, and each component may have multiple action buttons.None Angular way (a common approach)Declare a boolean state ‘loading’ in a component.Make it ‘true’ when the user ‘click’.Make it ‘false’ once the request becomes successful or throw an error.Attach this boolean to the UI element to show the loader and disable the button to avoid users from the double click.up to now we just resolve the first and second problems. what about the third and fourth.The Third problem, we just take the numbers of booleans as we have a number of action buttons on the view.The fourth problem can be handle by assigning a different class name and then interpolation to class attribute on the element. likeloading.component.tsloading.component.htmlit’s very painful to do this when you have hundreds of components and you need to do this, one thing more if you have multiple buttons in the same component, you want to create a separate state for each.Using the power 💪 of Angular Directives.There are a few issues in the above solution. LikeRepetition of code.No separation of concern.Need to add testing in each component.For this purpose, we are going to use the power angular directive.let’s create a simple directive.We make reference to the current element by injecting ELementRef. once we have a reference then we can easily add a class by native API (classList) and by hostListener we listen to the click on the button and add ‘active’ class, after 3-second add ‘success’ class and remove the ‘active’ class. here is a stackblitz-part-1.in a real scenario, we are calling the backend API which takes different amounts of time, not exactly 3-second.so we need to watch for real async request, in angular, we mostly handle async request through observable(httpClient also return observable).for the exact amount of time calculation, we need to pass observable and subscribe to it in the directive.loading.component.htmlloading.component.tsyou can control side effects (navigation, show toaster) in tap and error in catchError. stackblitz part 2.Wait, wait, our feature is not yet completed, we need to make it flexible because there are so many things to do like, consumers of directive want to do something before calling API service, etc.validate the form.pass data to login function.transform form data.show some confirmation dialog.so how we can do this 🤔.let’s move further.Inversion of Control.Instead of only passing observable to the directive, we need to give full control to the consumer to passing function to the directive and the function should return observable. let’s see in action.loading.directive.tsloading.component.tsloading.component.htmlwe returning observable from the function so need to subscribe at in the directive.In HTML, we need to use ‘bind’ to bind the context of ‘this’ to the current component otherwise it will use the context of the directive.you can add error class by explicitly throw an error in function like in case of an invalid form .we take care of it by wrap the function call at in try-catch.loader-directives-part-3 - StackBlitzStarter project for Angular apps that exports to the Angular CLIstackblitz.comI created the npm plugin. also, I created the NGXS version of this plugin.Follow me on Medium or Twitter to read more about Angular, NGXS, Javascript.Written byshahid ahmad bangashI’m a Frontend Engineer at SMSAMI.inc, open source maintainer and contributor, blogger.Follow284 284 284 AngularJavaScriptAngularjsAngular DirectiveWeb DevelopmentMore from shahid ahmad bangashFollowI’m a Frontend Engineer at SMSAMI.inc, open source maintainer and contributor, blogger.More From MediumBuilding a React library with a Cesium componentPrasanna Mahadevaswamy in Traversals Tech BlogDon’t Follow JavaScript TrendsNikola Đuza in Better Programming5 tips to make your JS code more communicativeAlen Vlahovljak in JavaScript In Plain EnglishThe Array Data Structuremartin cartledge in Dev Genius4 useful JavaScript Shorthands you can use in React.jsLouis Petrik in JavaScript In Plain EnglishSmartTV: Supporting it allMatthijs Langendijk in 24i MediaA gentle introduction to coding by making generative artIbby EL-SerafyBuilding JavaScript StylesheetsKurt CagleAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
"How really to store and check passwords (and API tokens, which are passwords)",https://medium.com/leonard-cyber/how-really-to-store-your-users-passwords-and-api-tokens-which-are-passwords-5132cec8835b?source=tag_archive---------2-----------------------,"Passwords,Password Security,Password Management,Web Development,Web Security","A cliché in posts detailing password storage schemes is to finish by telling the syadmins and generalist web developers not to store credentials in-house at all. I disagree with this prescription, mostly because I understand the practical reasons that make this difficult. Identity and access management is infinitely more expensive to course-correct when you aren’t the one authenticating your users. Writing auth is tricky, yes, but not only are you otherwise resigning yourself to lock-in off the bat, the size of a company’s information security department has not historically been a good indicator of how well credentials are secured. I think the type of devs who are conscientious enough to deliberately hand over their users’ fates to the “sign in with Twitter” buttons are also conscientious enough to use Argon2 instead of SHA2, and are not going to qualify for a lot of the benefit. There’s also people like me who will outright refuse to use a site that forces them to connect some social media profile or email in order to login. You’re better off learning how to build or at least identify a passable authentication pipeline now, and leave yourself the option of expanding or modifying it based on business need later.Before we start, let’s talk about what we’re actually preventing through well-thought-out password storage and update policies. The types of attacks you need to be seriously worried about as a developer are conditional on what you’re protecting. From a threat modeling perspective you can loosely consider three categories of web applications, when controlled for size:Applications that don’t handle money or other things of extractable monetary value (like server time, physical products, etc.).Applications that do handle money or other things of extractable monetary value.Applications that handle cryptocurrency, which is money but with built-in money-laundering for whoever steals it.If your product is in category #1, and you‘re not being entrusted with other apps that fall into categories #2 or #3, portions of this post may be overkill. Use your own judgement. Your resources might be better spent towards preventing SQLi, or wormable XSS, or horrible admin panel compromises, or some social engineering venue of total site compromise instead. I would still follow these guidelines anyways, because it’ll be a small amount of investment for something that’s going to be hard to change when you’ve got lots of users, but I can’t fault you for not really caring. Just remember that while you personally may not be guarding anything important, lots of your users almost certainly reuse passwords other places, and they care about your security.When we get to the second category, all of those in-group memes that information security professionals parrot to each other to feel important and economically necessary actually begin to coincide with reality. As with anything else, prioritize where necessary— but I think the measures I talk about in this post are ones that can qualify as “necessary-but-not-sufficient”.If your app is in category #3, and any implementation in this blog post is something you haven’t done or replaced with a better alternative, God help you.Provision #1: Cryptographic HashingHopefully if you’re making these types of business and architectural decisions you know that passwords are not supposed to be stored as-is in your database. If you don’t, now you do. You also need to make sure that you are not, as is sometimes common, inadvertently logging or recording the passwords your users sign up with anywhere in persistent storage. A rule of thumb you can use is that if your app is writing unencrypted credentials from your users to disk at any point in the signup or login process, via a database or anything else, something needs to be fixed.The reason this isn’t done is because it’s unnecessary for your website to actually know the password. All that the site has to do during login is verify that the password your users entered is the same as the one they signed up with, which does not require that it be written down anywhere. Instead, what should be stored is the “cryptographic hash” of the password, the result of a one-way function that turns the password into a fixed-size string. When users log in again, the hash of what password they entered can be compared with the hash stored on disk. This way, if anyone gets access to or leaks the site’s datastore, they don’t have the raw passwords, they have a “hash” of the password which they must then try to reverse by running lots of possible passwords through whatever hashing algorithm you chose.And hopefully if you’ve heard of cryptographic hashing, you’ve also heard that you shouldn’t store passwords without something called a “salt”, which is an additional random input to the hashing algorithm used to augment the hashing process. If you use a cryptographic hashing algorithm by itself, hackers can use a publicly available “rainbow table”, which is just a giant pre-computed map of passwords to hashes for that algorithm. With a random and long enough salt, each password has to be cracked individually, and hackers can’t share or generate these tables in advance.Unfortunately when many web application developers choose a cryptographic hash for their password hashing they tend to choose something like SHA-1/2/3, or maybe PBKDF2. Instead, you should use a recent “password hashing algorithm” like Argon2 or scrypt. The difference between the two is manyfold:PHAs are designed to be difficult to perform, and regular cryptographic hashing algorithms are designed for speed. The magic of AWS or my botnet can try trillions of SHA1 hashes after an hour for a couple hundred dollars. Using a good password hashing algorithm can cripple that to maybe hundreds of thousands, and allows you to specify how much RAM, parallelization, and CPU time to use so that the algorithm is maximally difficult but still feasible for the hardware you run it on. A 100ms delay is almost unnoticable to users who are signing in, but paralyzing to someone that has to try 50,000 other options before they get to “p@ssw0rd2!” in their wordlist.While not usually important in this context, some PHAs feature better side-channel consideration. Side-channel attacks are means by which you can glean sensitive information from the implementation side effects of a cryptographic operation, like through timing information, power consumption, or hardware usage. Normally, these require local access on the machine and intimate knowledge of hardware, but not always.PHAs are also designed to limit assymetry in the hash power of attackers and regular users. In the case of SHA1/2/3, specific ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) chips are sometimes developed to perform massive amounts of hashes at one time. Password hashing algorithms attempt to limit the advantage that can be gained through this approach, and make cracking proportional to the amount of general purpose hardware that the attacker has.As opposed to the standard SHA3+Salt scheme, password hashing algorithms make database password dumps almost as difficult to leverage as online password cracking attacks, where the attacker just tries different logins with a bot via your login page.Provision #2: Symmetric Encryption with a well-secured keyAnother cliché in password storage how-to’s is to first give encryption as an example of a bad solution, before introducing password hashing and presenting it as the correct alternative. Guess what? There’s no reason you can’t do both. You can start by hashing the passwords users give you to signup, and then before storing or retrieving those hashes, encrypt or decrypt them with a site-wide key.Sometimes its suggested to me that because the one has some datastore service (Heroku PostgreSQL, Amazon S3) that “encrypts all database contents at rest”, using a second decryption key is unnecessary. The problem is that your users table is not encrypted from your application. Those features are for keeping a few types of compromises of Heroku or AWS or Google Cloud Platform from leading to database dumps, but they don’t help keep it secure from people who find a SQL injection, unsecured admin panel, or employee laptop. Manual decryption prevents the hackers that get sideways access to your datastore from being able to grab the hashes in the first place, even if they’re making the same SQL select statements that your team does in your application code.Then it’s suggested that this is pointless, because whatever attacker that compromises a password database almost certainly has access to the key used to decrypt those password hashes during login. This is historically not correct; the adobe breach indicated many terrible things about Adobe’s security, but the key used to (AES-ECB, regrettably) encrypt their passwords were never found. I think this underlies a misconception about how this is done in practice: you shouldn’t store the key used to encrypt items in your database in that database. If you do, that really does mitigate a lot of the benefit. Pass the key into your app via an environment variable, and use whatever credential management solution (Hashicorp Vault, etc.) you’ve got going to store Postgres passwords or API keys to store the decryption key long term.Provision #3: Signup restrictionsPassword requirements get a bad rap — and generally they’re implemented poorly — but the idea is sound. The best way to ensure a password isn’t cracked is to use a good password. So don’t let your users use “qazwsxedc” as a password, or else your fancy hashing is useless (at least for those really uncooperative users). The real problem with these requirements is that the site is only loosely approximating “entropy of the password” through their 8-characters-and-one-number-and-one-special-character rules. People hate these naive measures of password strength, and rightly so; whenever I generate a 64 character alphanumeric password for KeePassXC, and it gets rejected, I immediately wonder what the devs were smoking.The solution here is simple. Now that you’re using a good, password hashing algorithm, and it will take most good solid attackers around ten millisecond per password try, just download a wordlist of the top ten million passwords or so. It doesn’t really matter that it’s representative of your users in particular, so long as its compiled from actual leaks, because we can afford five million or so in buffer. When your customers try to use a password on that list, reject it and explain that it’s on this file.People might complain about not knowing in advance whether or not their password is blacklisted while they signup, but this way you can be sure that your users are at least not going to be using one of those first ten million common passwords if someone gets the hashes. Perhaps you will be unlucky and your users will concentrate around the next couple million and some site-specific ones, but for the most part you’ll ensure that even uncooperative users’ passwords take days to be cracked cold, assuming the attacker managed to get the decryption key.And by this point you’ve basically removed most of the danger that comes from offline password cracking attacks. If I know someone is using this scheme, I’m more worried about the attack vector that was used to dump the users table than I am the actual passwords that got leaked in the process. Or other data like API tokens or “reset password” nonces that should be hashed but aren’t. That’s not going to prevent the media from publishing news articles pushing the free credit monitoring like crazy, though, so maybe keep diligently using those prepared statements.Provision #4: HIBPThis one might be controversial, but I’m putting it here anyways.Password reuse is now your largest remaining problem when it comes to securing user credentials, if you’ve been following this guide so far. Other, less savory sites are going to eventually leak plaintext or SHA1 versions of passwords associated with the same email address or username that’s your users signed up with. Most of your users will have dozens of accounts on dozens of different sites, and unless you’re a cryptocurrency exchange (and thus clearly not in need of this guide, right?) most of them will not use password managers.Have I Been Pwned is a site that keeps a database of 500 million breached passwords, and it is updated regularly with new breaches. I suggest, if your users’ password shows up clear on the initial 10M wordlist, that at signup you check that it doesn’t exist in this database via their published, no-rate-limit API. The API works by asking you to SHA1 hash your password, and send it the first 5 characters of the hexadecimal representation. It will respond in turn with the SHA1 hashes of every password in its database that has that prefix, which you can check for exact matches. This way, according to HIBP, by performing this lookup you don’t have to give them your password directly — you just give the SHA1 prefix, which could be the prefix to annnyyyything. They even allow you to set fixed padding, so an observer can’t make a guess at which section of the database you’re looking at based on how large the response is.Obviously some people will grumble at the imagined scenario of having their nice new Argon2 hashes partially compromised, because maybe an attacker who can connect these queries to accounts, can maybe throw out every possible password that doesn’t have a cousin with 3BC0F as a SHA-prefix. But I think this is more than worth it. There are a couple things about this service that mitigate this risk (and a couple things you can do to further mitigate it):The HIBP people seem like pretty standup guys. I trust them. Don’t you?There aren’t any API keys required to access this endpoint, which means HIBP doesn’t necessarily have to know it’s you who’s calling. If HIBP keeps logs of these queries (I sure hope they don’t), and they ever get leaked, it’s an extra step to tie them to your service based on IP address or some other metadata. It’s also an extra step to tie them to a particular session. You can even try to proxy your connection, if you want to be extra about it.If you don’t keep logs of these queries (please don’t), it’s somewhat unrealistic for any attacker to be able to time-correlate signups with what you asked for on the HIBP API. Without those logs that you keep and they steal, the fact that you asked if the user had a password of “X” but also maybe “Y” and “Z” that one time is just not very helpful info.You’re not actually letting users sign up with these passwords. Sure, they might just append them with a 1 or ! once you reject them and move on, but your attacker has to deal with finding the several dozen mutations surrounding the hashes in HIBP’s database rather than just the password itself.Nothings in their TOS says you can’t throw out a random string or five to HIBP every time you check a password, just to keep them on their toes.Again, use your own judgement, but in return, any password your user might have gotten leaked in the past, or that another person used and got leaked in the past, they won’t use on your service. Can’t ask for easier, more thorough password reuse prevention than that.The cliche response that you shouldn’t store passwords is hinting at something, though, and I think it’s that you shouldn’t leave your users with just one form of authentication. If you are a #2 service, encourage your accounts to have a second factor of authentication setup: ideally a Yubikey, but barring that Duo or Timed One-Time-Passwords. A password can be as random as you want, but ultimately they will be compromised through a number of different ways that have often little to do with your site’s security. I don’t think I’ve ever even heard of someone leaking Google Authenticator or Authy keys. It just never happens. Don’t let this inevitably lost nonce be instead the only barrier between me and total account takeover.Leonard CyberSecuring your web applications since the early twentiesFollow92 PasswordsPassword SecurityPassword ManagementWeb DevelopmentWeb Security92 claps92 clapsWritten byDean ValentineFollowHacker and CTO of Leonard Cyber.FollowLeonard CyberFollowLeonard Cyber is a web application security consulting & aptitude testing firm.

Generate PDFs in Angular with PDFMake,https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/generate-pdfs-in-angular-with-pdfmake-732557c91e9e?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"Web Development,Angular,Pdfmake,JavaScript,Programming","Recently I worked on a feature for a client that involved generating a PDF document from his Angular web application. After some research we decided to use PDFMake for this purpose.PDFMake is an excellent Javascript library for generating PDF documents. This short post is going to discuss how we can integrate the library with an Angular 9 app in a way that does not increase our initial bundle size!Why PDFMake?We chose PDFMake because it allows us to specify the data for generation using a document definition object format. Other libraries required absolute positioning to position our content in the document. Since we had quite a lot of data and formatting to do, having an easier format saved us a lot of time!To know more about PDFMake’s document definition object format, please refer to their official documentation.With this out of the way, let’s start integrating the library into an Angular app!Setting it upFirst, we’ll create a new Angular 9 app by executing the following commands in our terminal or console.ng new angular-pdf-generator --routing=falseLet’s also add the Angular Material library, so we can use a material button to allow the user to generate the PDF.ng add @angular/materialNext, let’s include the required material modules in our app.module.ts file.Finally, here is a simple UI for our purposes.A toolbar and a button will do the trick for now!Adding PDFMake to the appLet’s install PDFMake now from npm using the following command.npm install pdfmake --saveFor a better structure to our app, let’s encapsulate all of our PDF generation functions inside of a service. We can create that using the following command.ng generate service pdfStatic import and its effect on app bundle sizeAt this point, the typical way to include a Javascript library would be to use a static import statement at the top of our service file and then use the imported object for PDF generation. For PDFMake, it can be as follows.import pdfMake from 'pdfmake/build/pdfmake';import pdfFonts from 'pdfmake/build/vfs_fonts';pdfMake.vfs = pdfFonts.pdfMake.vfs;However, PDFMake is big library with a bundle size of approximately 3.7 MB. If we use the above approach, it is going to make our app bundle size unnecessarily large, even if only a part of our app needs the PDF generation. With an increasing focus on web performance nowadays, this would be an unwise move!Add Lazy Loading to our appTo handle such cases, Angular 9 allows us to use lazy loading for our packages. Lazy loading means we’re only going to load our PDFMake library when we actually need it. In our case we’re going to do it on our button click event.For lazy loading, we can use webpack’s awesome new dynamic import feature. Dynamic imports load our package on the fly and resolves to a Promise — so we can continue our work using the package just loaded.Let’s see how we add it to our PDF service.Let’s go over what we did here.First, we created a variable in our service to contain the pdfMake reference when we load it using the import statement.Then we create an async function to load the PDFMake library. We use two dynamic imports because fonts for PDFMake also need to be imported and set for it to work properly. Since both resolve to a Promise, we can use await keyword to wait on the imports before moving forward in the execution.Lastly, we just use the load function inside of our main generatePdf function, so that our library is loaded before we go on using it!We’re using a simple definition object here. PDFMake provides us a lot of options to create well formatted PDF documents, including with images!For more details refer to their official documentation.Calling the service from our componentAs a last step, let’s add the code to call our service from our component (after linking it with the button).Testing it all out!Let’s do ng serve and quickly test this out. Let’s open up our Developer Tools on the Network tab as well.When we run our app now and click the ‘Generate PDF’ button, we should see the PDF generated and opened up in a new tab. Cool!What’s more, if we look closely at the Network tab, we’ll see the following two libraries were lazy loaded when we clicked the button. Check out their sizes!This is exactly what we wanted! Our app’s initial size remains the same and we only load the PDFMake library when we need to — which saves us a hefty 3.7 MB in bundle size.How this worksThis works due to a webpack feature called dynamic imports. As soon as webpack notices an import statement in your code with a package name inside it, it will automatically create a separate bundle file for that package during compilation.This will then be used for lazy loading at runtime. Without us having to do anything else. Sweet!If you’d like to read up more on this webpack feature, here is the official documentation.ConclusionAs you can see, it is now quite easy and convenient for us to lazy load our PDFMake package when we feel like at runtime in our Angular app.This is not limited to PDF generation though and opens up a lot of possibilities for improving our app’s load performance in general as well. The less your initial bundle size, the better it is for your Lighthouse score (which is getting increasingly important nowadays).I hope you found this useful.

Ruby 3.0 Revealed...,https://medium.com/@gunjansolanki_007/ruby-3-0-revealed-b0cbfb352d8d?source=tag_archive---------4-----------------------,"Ruby,Ruby on Rails,Web Development,Software Development,Programming","Finally, the wait is over, Ruby 3.0 will be released this Christmas as confirmed by Matz, creator of Ruby in his last presentation.Every Ruby developer might have a bunch of questions floating in the mind, whether Ruby will overcome its shortcomings, become faster, or get async nature like other native languages like Javascript, the big buzz in the world of web development.Well, its hard to say now, but with its upcoming features will definitely raise the bars. The new version of Ruby seems to be specifically designed to make it faster, concurrent & correct.No more Performance issuesFalcon Rack server & Fibers:Asynchronous threads will be controlled by Fibers. Current web servers blocks i/o operations while async nature will free other processes like API call, database operation, etc.Why Fibers over Threads?Less context switching: Context switching occurs when CPU changes from the current task to another task.Ruby Actor or Ractor :Similar to web workers running in the background in javascript Ractor provides parallel execution. It makes the parallel programs thread-safe as ractors can not share normal objects. Ractors communication is supported by message passing.Memory Performance :With Garbage Compactor (GP) most objects will be transferred to the heap and automatically compacted.Type Checking in Ruby with RBSWhat is RBS?RBS is a type signature language that describes types & definition of classes, its methods, instances variables, inheritance/mix-in relations, and modules of Ruby. RBS comes with the goal to see common patterns in Ruby programs and also allows advanced types like union, method overloading, and generics.RBS gem makes it possible to process the definitions written in .rbs signature files.Special FeaturesJust In-time Compiler: JIT increases the speed of the compiling program by 50% — 500% depending on the workload.Numbered block parameters : [1..100].map {_1 * 3}Right AssignmentSome standard libraries are updated as well :RubyGems 3.2.0.rc.1, Bundler 2.2.0.rc.1, IRB 1.2.6, Reline 0.1.5Backward CompatabilitySwitching between different versions of Ruby will no longer be a problem and warnings in the logs will help to fix the errors quickly.The speculations that Ruby 3.0 is three times faster than Ruby 2.0 is flabbergasting but its yet to come and let’s see what all it offers.Written byGunjan SolankiSolution Engineer, Deqode, IndiaFollow48 48 48 RubyRuby on RailsWeb DevelopmentSoftware DevelopmentProgrammingMore from Gunjan SolankiFollowSolution Engineer, Deqode, IndiaMore From MediumHow to Connect Google Drive to Python using PyDriveSebastian Theiler in Analytics VidhyaMy Definition of a First-Class Pull RequestDevin Schulz in Cape Privacy (Formerly Dropout Labs)All We Need To Know About Python’s FunctionsRachit Tayal in Python FeaturesPython HOW: Image processing for OCR using OpenCVGabriel Harris Ph.D. in Analytics VidhyaCoding Bootcamps: a Glimpse at the Future of Education?James StanierLearn Golang by Solving Real-World ProblemsNeel Modi in Golang Jedi KnightScaling Startup Codebases: Nix those Rails N+1 queriesCurtis Autery in Beam DentalThings I Wish I Knew Before Majoring in Computer SciencePuloma Katiyar in ACM at UCRAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

It is true that your presence on social media platforms can help you grab the attention of the potential users but to create a brand image, you need to invest in web development.Hold on! You don’t need to trust our words just because we are saying you to do so. Instead, you can have a look over what experts have to say about the importance of having a website.It has been concluded that 46% of small businesses are not having their website and only 54% of businesses are having an official web page out of which major percentage is of Americans. Now the studies say that over 70–80% of people will research the company on the web before making a purchase decision. Users usually visit the company website to understand brand authenticity and credibility. Moreover, sometimes even a one-page website can help you build trust and enables you to showcase your product and services in a perfect way. — “Rehan Fernando, CEO at Eight25Media”.No matter what type of business you are running. If you have customers, it is necessary to have some sort of information online, at least a single page describing your profile and what type of services you are offering along with the contact information. If you are thinking that hiring a web development company for your business is just an additional financial burden on you and you are ignoring the real fact, then you are easily passing your potential customers to the other businesses. — “Max Elman, Founder of Razorfrog Web Design”Conclusion: At one side, a website can fuel the growth of your business, on the other side, poor choice of technology or badly designed website can easily turn your potential customers into annoying users. Let’s learn how:75% of customers judge the credibility of the business through the website design.79% of shoppers expect your website load time should be less than 2 seconds.However, this is all about the role of the website. But now the industry has come to a step ahead and web app developments are steadily paving their space in the digital world.No matter what type of web app you are trying to construct, but the performance of the site greatly depends on the scripting that is running in the background and the software development company you hire for the project. Moreover, how the apps have been programmed can also make a great difference in website performance. Right from seamlessly watching videos on Youtube, networking with business partners on Linkedin to reading content on Wikipedia, every app has a strong background of scripts or codes that empowers them to perform well in front of users.So when it comes to choosing the best programming languages for web app development in 2020, PHP and .Net are the two most commonly used PLs after Javascript.Undoubtedly, PHP and .Net are the lions of the web development industry but comparing these two titans are like comparing the Apples and Oranges. But the central question is, why to hire a PHP development company over .NET for building the website?Let’s directly jump to the detailed comparison of the PHP and .Net to understand what exactly empowers PHP over .NET…Let the Battle Begin with the basics:1. Understanding the Basics Of PHP and .NETIn a Nutshell: Both PHP and .NET are the widely used open-source programming languages for web development. But as PHP scripts are embedded in HTML, therefore it is widely used for web development projects. On the other hand .NET is a framework that includes many components that help in development, running and execution of the web apps.PHP: PHP is a server-side web development language that evolved from the small open-source projects. It was introduced in 1995 by Rasmus Lerdorf and make use of most important IDEs including Eclipse, NetBeans and Zend Studio for web development.Moreover, since it is a server-side language, it is efficient in accessing and managing the various types of database. Also, PHP provides back for other services supporting multiple protocols like POP3, HTTP, IMAP, LDAP, etc.Due to its adaptability and flexibility, 26.2% of developers are using this programming language for web app development.Image Source.NET: This framework is developed by Microsoft and uses various technologies including CLR that manages code execution at the runtime. In addition, it uses some components that handle threads and memory. Today 35.1% of developers are using .NET as it supports multiple languages such as C#, Visual Basic, Visual C++ and Python.Image SourceTo wrap up this brief of both languages, it is worth saying that PHP is an open-source and free to use server-side programming language which marked its first release in Nov 1997. Whereas, .NET is a paid Microsoft Platform and came up with its first release in Jan, 2002. On one side PHP is a unique blend of programming language and a web framework whereas .NET is a straight application framework.2. PHP Vs. .NET: Performance and SpeedConclusion: When it comes to web development, performance and speed of the website can be a real game-changer. So if you are assuming that hiring a .NET developer is the only solution to deal with, then you might be mistaken.The performance and speed of a platform are correlated with each other. The performance of the site is depending upon how much time a browser takes to respond to the query and the speed of the communication between the servers plays an important role in evaluation.So here are the three factors that help you evaluate the performance and speed of the PHP and .Net:While comparing the ease of accessing the file system, PHP and .NET merely have any major difference, but accessibility will be better when the developer is using a Linux system with ext4 file for operating servers, instead of window operating system and NTFS system.PHP uses LAMP stack, i.e., MySQL, Apache, Linux and its script runs on its own memory space, which brings out better performance. But on the other side, a .NET program is created on the COM-based system that slows down the entire program execution process.Thirdly, the performance and speed of the web greatly depend on the code writing skills of the developer. The coding expertise with both PHP and .NET is crucial to attaining the high standard performance of the web app. So it is always recommended to hire an expert software development company that has solid command over leading programming languages.To wrap up this point, it is fair enough to say that the performance and speed of the website with both PHP and .NET stand almost equal in a few ways. But the choice of server operating system, bandwidth and coding expertise can easily affect the performance of the web app.3. PHP Vs .NET: Which One is Affordable?Conclusion: Whether you are a bootstrapper or an entrepreneur, the web app development cost is the biggest concern for of everyone. And this is where PHP steals the show as it is free to use and an open-source web programming language, whereas .NET is a paid product of Microsoft.PHP: Being an open-source programming language, there is no need to bear any development cost while hiring PHP development company as there is no license fee associated with it.cost required. Moreover, upgrading and updating a web app can be far simple and free with PHP. This is why most businesses prefer PHP for web app development comparatively .NET..NET: Since it is It is a baby of Microsoft, thus naturally comes up with the licensing charges. Moreover, all the third-party tools of .NET have attached license cost that will immediately uplift the development budget cost.4. PHP Vs .NET: Market ShareConclusion: PHP is more popular among developers and acquiring the largest segment of the market due to its inbuilt features and various other reasons. But, overall both of these languages are acquiring 91% of market share.Image Source: https://trends.builtwith.com/framework/programming-languagePHP: The forecast from the BuiltWith data source, reveals that PHP is considered as one of the most loved programming languages in the market. In top 1M sites, there are 554,769 websites built with PHP and capturing the market share of 58%..NET: This programming language has also secured its place in the list of popular technologies but acquired only 26.36% of market share.5. PHP Vs .NET: Best Recommended ForConclusion: When it comes to web app development solutions, PHP is majorly used by the small to medium sized organisations whereas .NET is considered by the large size organizations, but sometimes it can be used by the medium sized business for web app development.PHP: According to the report, 58% of small size businesses with the employee strength of 1–10 are using PHP and 22% are medium size businesses using it for web development. However, it doesn’t underestimate its potential for developing large scale applications and one of the best examples is Facebook application build with PHP.Image Source: https://enlyft.com/tech/products/php.NET: Since it is integrated with various components and technologies that help in managing codes at the runtime and handle threads, therefore, it is widely used for the large scale applications. But still PHP has a greater reach in comparison to .NET as more than 7500 verified companies are using PHP for the web development.6. PHP Vs .NET: CompatibilityConclusion: Again PHP overtakes .NET in terms of compatibility as PHP works on multiple platforms like linus, windows and more whereas .NET works with Linux, and window based applications.PHP: The reason being for hiring web developers for PHP is,it is based on a simple principle “Write Once To Use Anywhere” and works on multiple platforms like Unix, Solaris, Windows and Linux. In addition, it has the capability to work with various web servers and database systems that ultimately improves the flexibility..NET: It works with LINUX and other windows-based applications that make it popular among developers.7. PHP Vs .NET : What Coding Expertise is Required?Comparison: To enhance the performance of the web app, it is important to have a solid command over a programming language. In comparison, PHP is easier to learn which is why it is used world widely.PHP: Being one of the most mature and old programming languages, it is easier to learn and understand. Moreover, if coding is simple, developing a web app or program also becomes easier and simpler..NET: Since it is based on #C language, which is not only difficult to understand but also requires high skills to learn this language. To develop a web app with .NET, you need to hire a mobile app development company equipped with pro developers having a rich experience of working with .NET.ConclusionThe simple aim of writing this blog is not to declare any winner, instead, we have concluded few important points that make you understand why PHP is widely used over .NET for web development.Hopefully, you have understood what exactly empowers PHP and why developers are widely using this language for web development. If you still have any doubt in this blog, then it would be recommended to get in touch with the expert web development company who will further suggest to you the best solutions.Quick CodeFind the best tutorials and courses for the web, mobile…Follow15 3 Sign up for Developer UpdatesBy Quick CodeReceive weekly updates about new posts on programming, development, data science, web development and more Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

My Git Management Strategy,https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/my-git-management-strategy-fbdd342e416d?source=tag_archive---------6-----------------------,"Git,Programming,Software Development,Productivity,Web Development","Every new software project requires a version control strategy that suits a variety of needs:A locked down master branch that is always shippable to productionEasy to follow for all development team membersCreates a clean history that makes it easy to understand what changes occurredAs a bonus, the following strategy also enables effective code review, and the ability to create automated releases, versioning, and testing.First, What branches are important?MasterYour master branch is your source of truth for the current state of the application.Any code deployed to master can (and should) be deployed to some form of production environment.Changes being merged to master should already have undergone any checks or guards that your team establishes for code to be considered “done”. This could include unit testing coverage, integration testing, manual testing, QA approval, security check, and code reviews.ToDevelopIf your team builds products in larger release candidates, this branch would be where you merge and integrate that next version. This branch is inherently more volatile than master, but it should still represent a functioning version of the site.If your team is disciplined enough to only create functioning, isolated features, you might not actually need a develop branch. Pull requests might even be made directly to master, integrated, and tested there, and then be deployed as soon as it is approved — however, that is an idea for a more involved article on trunk-based development.Feature branchesWhen we build functionality or changes to the codebase, we branch off of the current develop branch, and make our changes against it.When changes are ready to deploy, we will open a pull request against develop and go through the necessary checks, such as a code review, automated testing, linting, and QA review. With proper tooling, these changes can be integrated and deployed to a production-like environment, where it can be tested alongside existing code.These branches can be named however your team prefers.I personally follow the convention of prefixing each branch with its type of change:feature/chore/fix/improvement/Followed by a brief description of the actual change.Example: feature/header-logo, fix/blog-feed-not-loading, chore/upgrade-node-packages, or docs/deployment-processNext, how do we actually make changes?First, branch off of developgit checkout developgit checkout -b feature/blog-reelNow we have our new feature branch!Next, let’s make some commitsWhen making commits, it is good to have a standard, but some general best rules:Each commit is a functioning change that another developer can pull into other branches safelyAffects a specific enough scope that it can be easily reviewed and understood.Describes what occurred at a glance, but includes any necessary description.As with all naming, do what you prefer, as long as you have a standard.I personally follow Semantic Commits, which I may write about later.An abbreviated description:[type]([scope]): [description of change][Explanation of changes][#ISSUE NUMBER]This can amount to something like:feat(blog): Add descriptions to blog reel  - Add descriptions to GraphQL Fragments and queries  - Add description to BlogReelItem container  - Add descriptions to test fixtures  - Update tests[#3]Depending on your requirements, you can probably just get along with the first line. Just be sure to make the reader aware of what this change will do to the software!When the code is done, we create our pull request!…But first, we rebase!git rebase developOkay, now open that pull requestInside of your pull request, you’re going to have to add a title and description. It is good to have a standard way of writing these. If you’re interested in really standardizing the way you make PRs, consider github-templates.From here, someone on your team should give your code a code review. If you are the only one, wait a day, and then try to re-read the code. Make comments and write out questions wherever something is difficult to read or understand, and tag if there is a significant issue. This is the same process you’ll follow on code reviews for others as well!One of the most important parts of this workflow is having a formal commit and branching strategy to enable better workflow systemization and (eventually) automation. Here’s an article where I go into detail about how to write better commits with semantic commit:Write Better Commits With Semantic CommitsGood commits can make the difference between a well-maintained product, and a terrible product.

Using Selector in Provider,https://medium.com/flutter-community/using-selector-in-provider-b32113d5da64?source=tag_archive---------7-----------------------,"Flutter,Dart,Flutter Web,Web Development,Cross Platform","Using selector in providerHow to use Selector in Provider? Hmm…All in one Flutter resource: https://flatteredwithflutter.com/using-selector-in-provider/Using Selector in ProviderPre-Requisite:This article assumes the reader knows the use of Provider.Begin…View the demo hereWebsite: https://web.flatteredwithflutter.com/#/We will cover briefly aboutSelectorUsing Selector with ProviderUsing Selector in ProviderCurrent StatusLet's start by describing what we have currently. In our demo, we have an input form with 3 fields:Name FieldAge FieldEmail FieldUsing Selector in ProviderThere are 3 text fields, which basically show us the values inside each of the input fields.Approach 1 (All this time I took)Using Selector in ProviderAs per this approach, we would have aChangeNotifierProvider, at the top of the widget tree.Followed by a consumer, before we start our formFinally, our Form UIThings to consider:Your Form fields will undergo unnecessary builds. Let me explain.For instance, say you are entering the age field, other fields (name and email field), will continue rebuilding since the Consumer widget is above the Form.This is true for any other field also.As per the Consumer documentation:builder may be called multiple times (such as when the provided value change).In our case, we just have 3 fields inside FormUI, so we can go with approach1, but what if we had a complex UI, think about it!Approach 2 (Using Selector in Provider)Using Selector in ProviderWhen I started to use Provider in Flutter, most of the times, it was eitherChangeNotifierProviderConsumer, Consumer2, etcValueListenableProviderStreamProviderFutureProviderNow we will use a Selector.In this approach, we have ChangeNotifierProvider at the top, followed by our UI.For adding values to our model (ChangeNotifier model, UserData) we usecontext.read<UserData>()Using Selector in ProviderThis is an extension included in Provider, now we have the input inside our model(UserData).Note: Setting of the value, notifies the model since the setter implements notifyListeners.set emailAddress(String emailAddress) {   _emailAddress = emailAddress;   notifyListeners();}// SIMILAR FOR NAME AND AGESimilarly, we do this for all the input fields (name, age, and email)Let's say, we want to display the values entered in these fields in real-time.Selector in ProviderEmail Text should only listen to Email Field.Name + Age Text should only listen to changes in Name and Age FieldsFor displaying all values of the form, we need to listen to every fieldEmail Textfinal _email =context.select<UserData, String>((model) => model.emailAddress);return Text('(Listen to Email) Email : $_email');We use context.select.As per documentationWatch a value of type [T] exposed from a provider, and listen only partially to changes.By using [select], instead of watching the entire object, the listener will rebuild only if the value returned by selector changes.Hence for email text, we select only the email field and get notified when it changes.Name + Age TextHere, we want to listen to two fields from our notifier model.Time to introduce a new package tuple.This package gives us options to select the number of values and comes recommended by Provider. Currently supports 7 values.To select multiple values without having to write a class that implements ==, the easiest solution is to use a ""Tuple"" from tupleSince we need 2 fields, we use Tuple2Tuple2 exampleHere, we use the Selector widgetAn equivalent to [Consumer] that can filter updates by selecting a limited amount of values and prevent rebuild if they don’t change.Criteria: Tuple2 of Name field and age field, Tuple2<String, int>.Inside our builder, we can retrieve these values bydata.item1 // For name, since First value of Tuple is Stringdata.item2 // For age, since Second value of Tuple is intAll TextHere, we need to listen to all the values inside our notifier model. This turns out to be a good use-case for Consumer.Consumer<UserData>(  builder: (_, data, __) {    return Text(          '(Listening to all) Name : ${data.name} >>> Age : ${data.age} >>> Email${data.emailAddress}',    );  },);Hosted URL: https://web.flatteredwithflutter.com/#/Source code for Flutter Web App.Interesting Articles related to Forms here:Flutter Web and StreamsHow to use streams in flutter web.

How To Automate Builds In Vue.js Projects With Gulp,https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/how-to-automate-builds-in-vue-js-projects-with-gulp-ef3ca9f4a2d5?source=tag_archive---------8-----------------------,"Vuejs,JavaScript,Programming,Software Development,Web Development","Photo by Jared Brashier on UnsplashWe know there are so many tasks we do manually while building a Vue project or any front end applications. We can automate all the repetitive tasks with the help of gulp. With Gulp, we can automate and enhance your workflow.In this post, we will see two example projects one is a basic javascript project to get familiar with gulp and another is a full-blown Vue.js project. In the Vue project, we can see how we can automate builds.What is GulpInstalling GulpExample Project With Basic GulpExample Project With VueSummaryConclusionWhat is GulpGulp is a toolkit to automate and enhance your workflow and you can use gulp and the flexibility of Javascript to automate slow, repetitive workflows and compose them into efficient build pipelines. It is flexible, comparable, and efficient. For example, if you are building a typescript project you can use gulp to transpile into a Javascript before running your project or you can use some plugins to optimize images for your project or you can watch files and build the project automatically.You can automate a lot more tasks like above with gulp. There are a lot of plugins built by the community. These plugins do some tasks efficiently and you can use these as building blocks and chain them to get the desired result.Installing GulpWe need a node installed on our machine as a prerequisite. If you don’t have node installed check this link to install it. Once installed, check the version with this command to make sure you have installed it correctly.node --versionnpm --versionOnce you have a node on your machine install the gulp globally so that you can use the command gulp anywhere you want. Once installed, check the version.npm install -g gulp-cligulp --versionInstalling gulpExample Project With Basic GulpLet’s run some example scenarios with some basic gulp project here and clone the below project.// clone the projectgit clone https://github.com/bbachi/gulp-examples.git// install dependenciesnpm installGenerating Files, Folders, and Moving FilesThis is a simple scenario where you can general a file an folder, moving the file into that folder, and finally, delete the file. Since all these tasks are done one by one we need to execute in series. You need to run with this command gulp --gulpfile gulpfile1.jsgulpfile1.jsZipping all the files and produce outputThis scenario is to zip all the files and put them into some folders.gulpfile2.jsThese are just two examples of what we could with a gulp. There are a lot of plugins available and with these plugins, we can do a lot more.Example Project With VueThis is a simple project which demonstrates developing and running Vue application with NodeJS. We have a simple app in which we can add users, count, and display them at the side, and retrieve them whenever you want.Example ProjectHere is a Github link to this project. You can clone it and run it on your machine.// clone the projectgit clone https://github.com/bbachi/vuejs-nodejs-example.git// strat the apicd apinpm installnpm run dev// start the react appcd my-appnpm installnpm run servePackaging With GulpIn the above sections, we have seen manual steps and these steps have to be eliminated. We can achieve complete automation with the gulp. All the following steps can be made automated with the gulp.Clean the directory if existsCreate a directory if not exists to put all the production buildBuild a Vue code with Vue-cli-servicePlace the Vue code into the production directoryBuild the server code with the webpackPlace the server code into the production directoryFinally, zip all the code.Let’s install all the required gulp packages to accomplish the above points.// install gulp globallynpm install gulp -g// install as dev dependencynpm install gulp gulp-zip fancy-log del webpack-stream --save-dev// gulp              - core library// gulp-zip          - zipping the code// fancy-log         - logging// del               - deleting files/folders// webpack-stream    - Build with webpackwhen you run the command gulp it looks for the gulpfile.js file and executes all the tasks mentioned in that file. We can execute these tasks one by one or in parallel with the help of these modules series, parallel. Here is the file gulpfile.js.gulpfile.jsMake sure you let the express server know the static assets of Vue UI (line 11) and the path is correct when you send the file for default route / (line 27).server.jsYou can actually see some tasks are run one by one and others are in parallel. For example, copying Vue code and building server code (line 67) can be run in parallel because there is no dependency between these. With the gulpfile.js in place, all you need to do is issue this command gulp.Building With gulpOnce you run the gulp command you can see the production build under the folder named prod-build as we mentioned in the gulpfile.js.production buildLet’s run the app with the following commands. The entire app runs on the port 3080.// change the directorycd prod-build// run the nodejs servernode server.bundle.jsAn app running on the port 3080SummaryWith Gulp, we can automate and enhance your workflow.Gulp is a toolkit to automate and enhance your workflow and you can use gulp and the flexibility of Javascript to automate slow, repetitive workflows and compose them into efficient build pipelines.The available plugins do some tasks efficiently and you can use these as building blocks and chain them to get the desired result.We often get to build Vue projects for different environments we can use gulp to automate some of these tasks, for example, moving files, translating, cleaning directories, etc.ConclusionAlways automate the tasks that need manual intervention and you can save a lot of development time.Bachina LabsTutorials Ranging from Beginner guides to Advanced | Never…Follow51 Sign up for BB Tutorials & ThoughtsBy Bachina LabsTutorials Ranging from Beginner guides to advanced on Frontend, Backend, Blockchain, Docker, k8s, DevOps, Cloud,AI, ML.

5 Reasons to Learn React Library Right Now,https://medium.com/swlh/5-reasons-to-learn-react-library-right-now-1f37c1c0b796?source=tag_archive---------9-----------------------,"JavaScript,Programming,Web Development,React,Technology","Photo by Max Duzij on UnsplashThere are more than 50,000 job openings to React in the USA alone! Moreover, the demand for react developers isn’t showing any decline.React js is indeed a high paying skill to learn in 2020/2021, for which there is a lot of demand and less supply. With the dawn of a single page application, I don't see we are going to see React Js going anywhere in this decade.But what makes React so popular and wanted and why you need to learn or use React in your next project? We are going to find answers in this post.React is a JavaScript library primarily used for building amazing user interfaces in a short time. There are other libraries that serve the same purpose, but React is in the competition of its own. It is super easy and lightweight. You can start using react in 5 days.React works with reusable components, that leads to way less code. There are already tons of Components readily available, you just need to download and plugin, super easy😎!The same thing built with pure JavaScript is tougher and time-consuming and the worst of all your code won’t have a robust structure.Which companies in the world are using React JsWhatsApp, Facebook, Tesla, Reddit, Paypal, Twitter, Netflix, and the list keeps going.Here are the top reasons why you should consider using React JS over other JavaScript libraries.1. Easy😎 to learn and useReact comes with a user-friendly and easy to understand JavaScript documentation, I love the documentation as much as react. You will easily grasp the components right away even without guidance from another developer. It is super easy!React uses plain JavaScript and its lifecycle is clearly defined. It is easy and to use the component-based approach to build your website or mobile application. The simplicity of React makes it preferred to the complex Angular framework and Ember.2. Reusable♻ componentsReact JS uses a component-based structure that enables you to start with small components and progress to large components.For instance, you can start with small components like dropdown, button, or checkbox and then use them to create large wrapper components. You progress from one level of wrapper component to a higher level until you achieve one root component. The root component is your mobile application.Each component on React JS has a unique internal logic that determines how the component is rendered.The major advantage of components on this JavaScript library is that you can re-use them on any platform. Consequently, your app or website will have the same outlook on all platforms.Re-usable components simplify the app development process. Also, re-usable codes enable you to grow and maintain your codebase fast.3. Fast⚡ rendering with virtual DOMOne of the top considerations when choosing a programming framework is performance. The consideration is important if you are developing a mobile application that will involve high user interactions and constant updates.Many JavaScript libraries can create complex applications, but their DOM (Document Object Model) manipulations are slow. Web Developers can overcome the challenge of updating DOM by choosing React JS.In React, for every DOM object, there is a corresponding virtual DOM object. A virtual DOM object is a representation of a DOM object, like a lightweight copy.A virtual DOM object has the same properties as a real DOM object, but it lacks the real power to directly change what’s on the screen.Manipulating the DOM is slow. Manipulating the virtual DOM is much faster because nothing gets drawn onscreen.Think of manipulating Virtual DOM like changing the map or blueprint of your room furniture as opposed to changing the actual furniture in the room.4. Easy😎 to update components, individually or in bulkReactJS also allows you to quickly iterate on any element. You want to modify the color of all buttons throughout the website? A few seconds and it’s done. Want to stop redirecting from each case study to an outdated landing page? Swapping all the old links with the new ones is a breeze. Of course, if you wish to only modify one or a few components, you can do it without affecting any other elements of your project.The logic behind each component can be defined by a developer once and React will just use it to display elements exactly where we want them to be, across the entire project. Maintaining the code base a lot easier with React!5. React NativeLearning React comes with a bonus: React Native. React is not “write once use anywhere” as the creators say but it is more like learn once use everywhere library.Yes, you can write native apps for Android and iOS using React Native. Although you will not be able to use the exact same code you wrote for the web, you will be able to use the same methodology and the same architecture.Please note that I have only talked about the positive aspects of React and not the negatives. Yes, there are some problems with react which we will talk about in another post, but one thing is sure React is amazing.React is phenomenal not only in the job perspective but also it is pleasurable for the developer who works with it.Anyone asks me what front-end framework to learn, I always recommend React. Yes, there are other alternatives but React is the better!More to read…9 Things I Wish I’d Known When I Started as a Web DeveloperIf I had known these it would have halved the time taken.medium.comYouTube vs Books for Developers: Why You Need to Read Books More!“Books are the quietest and most constant of friends; they are the most accessible and wisest of counselors, and the…medium.comThe StartupMedium's largest active publication, followed by +723K people.

MERN: How to deploy your web apps to Digital Ocean,https://medium.com/@akhil.akhil8/mern-how-to-deploy-your-web-apps-to-digital-ocean-345484522320?source=tag_archive---------11-----------------------,"Mern Stack,Full Stack,DevOps,Web Development,Mongodb","OverviewWe’ve all seen countless tutorials on Udemy or Youtube where they teach you how to create MERN apps and every single one of them deploys them to Heroku. I have nothing against Heroku, it’s a great platform if you want to deploy your personal projects quickly. But when it comes to large scale real-life projects, Heroku is not what is used. The problem with these tutorials is that they give you very unrealistic expectations and don’t prepare you for the real world.Most companies use AWS EC2 to deploy their web apps and it is wildly different from platforms like Heroku but I understand that can be very expensive and complicated for many developers out there. So instead, we are going to talk about a similar IaaS platform called Digital Ocean. It is much cheaper, more User friendly and actually looks good (We all know AWS isn’t the best-looking thing out there). So in this article, I’m going to walk you through step by step on how to deploy your MERN apps to Digital Ocean. You can sign up using this link to get $100 free credit.Step 1 — Create a new dropletAfter logging in or successfully signing up for a new account, open the “Create” drop-down menu and click the “Droplets” link.This will take you to the “Create Droplets” page where you’ll be given some configuration options before creating a new server.In the first section, select the Ubuntu operating system for your server.Then choose the Basic plan for $5/month. This should give you enough processing power to run a medium-sized web app but you can always upgrade later if necessary.Next, choose if you require additional block storage (Similar to AWS S3) for storing static assets like Images, Videos etc. This may depend on your specific requirements but I personally never needed it as you already get 25 GB SSD disk space with the $5/month Basic plan. You should also pick a datacentre that is closest to your website visitors as this is where your server resides.Next, create a root password that will be used to access the droplet later.Next, choose how many droplets you want to deploy and pick a hostname. This will give your server a name to remember it by. You can also optionally add tags and assign them to existing projects if you want.Finally, you can choose if you want backups of your droplet generated every week. Personally I don’t see the need for this as we will be using Github to store our web app and that in itself is a backup. Click “Create Droplet” to create your droplet with our configuration.Step 2 — Server accessWe can now access our droplet as the root user, using the password you created in the last step. To do this, open up your terminal in your local computer and run the following command> ssh root@server_ip_addressAlthough this works, we are discouraged from using root access on a regular basis. This is because very destructive changes (even by accident) can be made while using it.Therefore, we need to create an alternative account with limited scope that will be used for daily work (Similar to IAM in AWS). We can do this by running the following command while logged in as root user in our droplet.> adduser <username>Now since our user has limited privileges at this point, we need to give our new user root privileges using the following command:> usermod -aG sudo <username>Step 3 — Set up FirewallWe need to firewall to improve our server security.You can see which applications are allowed by our droplet’s firewall by running the following command:> sudo ufw app listWe need to make sure the firewall allows SSH connections so that we can log back in next time. To allow these types of connections, type the following commands:> sudo ufw allow OpenSSH> sudo ufw enableYou can double-check that our SSH connections are still allowed by> sudo ufw statusStep 4 — Configure your Domain nameBefore you proceed, make sure you have already bought a domain. I recommend Namecheap for this.Configuring DNSBack on the DigitalOcean website, open the “Create” drop-down menu and click the “Domains/DNS” link.In the “Add a Domain” section, enter your domain (this is usually the base only: example.com and not www.example.com) and click the ""Add Domain"" button.Next, We need to create two A records for your website. A records map an IPv4 address to a domain name. Make sure they direct to your droplet.For the first one, enter @ in the HOSTNAME field and select the server you want to point the domain name to:For the second one, enter www in the HOSTNAME field and select the same server:Configuring Domain registrar to point to your dropletFirst, sign in to your Namecheap account and click “Domain List” in the left-hand column. You will be presented with a dashboard listing all of your domains.Click the “Manage” button of the domain you’d like to update.In the “Nameservers” section of the resulting screen, select Custom DNS from the dropdown menu and enter the following nameservers:ns1.digitalocean.comns2.digitalocean.comns3.digitalocean.comIt may take some time for the name server changes to propagate after you’ve saved them.During this time, the domain registrar communicates the changes you’ve made with your ISP (Internet Service Provider). In turn, your ISP caches the new nameservers to ensure quick site connections. This process usually takes about 30 minutes but could take up to a few hours depending on your registrar and your ISP’s communication methods.Step 5 — Install and Configure SoftwaresIf you have used the new Marketplace feature by Digital Ocean called “1 Click Applications”, all the software is pre-installed for you. So I will not get into the details of how to install them.You can create a NodeJS one-click application at this link and follow Steps 1–4. These are the software pre-installed on your droplet.When you install your app using “1 Click install”, there is a sample app called hello created for you. We need to clean this up by running the following commands> sudo -u nodejs pm2 delete hello> sudo -u nodejs pm2 saveStep 6 — Clone your Github repositoryYou can clone your Github repository which contains your web app into your droplet anywhere using the following command:git clone <repositorylink>Step 7 — Manage your web app using PM2We will be using a NodeJS process manager called PM2 (preinstalled), to run our apps in production.First cd into your cloned repository where your app lives and install any required dependencies like npm install or any build scripts. After that, you can run your app using the following command:> pm2 start <app-entry-filepath> --name name-your-appThis also adds your application to PM2’s process list, which is outputted every time an application is started. Here is what the output should look like:You can test that our app is running on localhost:<PORT> by running:curl http://localhost:<PORT>For more commands and information on PM2, check out this amazing cheatsheetStep 8 — Expose your app to the outside world using NGINX as a reverse proxyOur app is running on localhost:<PORT> but how can the outside world access it? We can do this by editing the NGINX config file.Access the config file in the nano editor by> sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/defaultEdit the existing entry that exposes the “hello” app at port 3000 to the world so that it points to your app’s <PORT> instead.location / {    proxy_pass http://localhost:3000; //Change to your port    proxy_http_version 1.1;    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';    proxy_set_header Host $host;    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;}Test for errors and enable your new configuration> sudo nginx -t > sudo systemctl restart nginxMake sure your app runs automatically on system launch or crashes etc by> pm2 saveThat's it, folks! Assuming every step was successful, You can now access your web app at your domain.You can check my other tutorial on how to set up CI/CD pipeline to your web app for continuous deployment from Github to Digital Ocean hereWritten bySaiakhil KovvurI’m a travel enthusiast who’s been to 75 countries.

Building a Multiroom Chat Application in Node JS,https://medium.com/weekly-webtips/building-a-multiroom-chat-application-in-node-js-8a8adca5acf2?source=tag_archive---------12-----------------------,"Nodejs,JavaScript,Jquery,HTML,Web Development","Live DemoGithub:https://github.com/mehulk05/Chat-app-using-NodejsLive Url:https://chatapp-using-node.herokuapp.com/In this tutorial, we will use the Node.js platform to build a real-time chat application that sends and shows messages to a recipient instantly without any page refresh. Also, we have some validations like if the username is taken then we will have to choose some other username. If two users are in the same room then only they can see the message of each otherBefore we start, let’s have a quick look at the prerequisitePrerequisite:Basics of Node.jsGood understanding of JavascriptBasics of JqueryNode.jsNode.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside the browser. The most important advantage of using Node is that we can use JavaScript as both a front-end and back-end language.As we know, JavaScript was used primarily for client-side scripting, in which scripts were embedded in a webpage’s HTML and run client-side by a JavaScript engine in the user’s web browser.Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write Command Line tools and for server-side scripting — running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user’s web browser.Getting StartedCreate a directory for the application, open the directory with your favorite editor(I personally prefer VSCode):mkdir chatApplication && cd clientNext, let’s initialize the directory as a Nodejs application.npm init -yFolder StructureFolder Structure for Our AppChat Application ArchitectureChats architectures are commonly thought based on a server-side application that will support the requests coming from the client (in this case, some JavaScript/Ajax) and deal with the business logic along with database storing, event processing, queues, etcSince not all the versions of all browsers (the old ones) support WebSockets, Node.js created a module which is used for all transport protocol. So in this article, we will create a project to get to know the basics of Socket.IO and what it can offer us, without the use of a database, Ajax, or another back-end language… only JavaScript, Node.js, and jQuery.About Socket.IOSocket.IO enables real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication.It works on every platform, browser, or device, focusing equally on reliability and speed.Building the Server-sideTo install socket.io:npm install -s socket.iowe also need an HTTP package for Socket.io to work:npm install -s httpAdd the following code to server.js:var http = require(‘http’).Server(app);var io = require(‘socket.io’)(http);And we can create a connection:io.on(‘connection’, () =>{ console.log(‘a user is connected’)})In the index.html add the following tag:<script src=”/socket.io/socket.io.js”></script>Complete index.jsconst path = require('path')const http = require('http')const express = require('express')const socketio = require('socket.io')const { generatemsg, generateLocation } = require('./utils/messages')const { addUser, removeUser, getUser, getUserInRoom } = require('./utils/users')const app = express()const server = http.createServer(app)const io = socketio(server)const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000const publicdir = path.join(__dirname, '../public')app.use(express.static(publicdir))//connection by serverio.on(""connection"", (socket) => {    console.log(""new connection"")socket.on(""join"", ({ username, room }, cb) => {const { error, user } = addUser({ id: socket.id, username, room })if (error) {            return cb(error)        }        socket.join(user.room)        socket.emit(""message"", generatemsg(""Admin ,Welcome""))        socket.broadcast.to(user.room).emit(""message"", generatemsg(`Admin ${user.username} has joined!`))io.to(user.room).emit(""roomData"", {            room: user.room,            users: getUserInRoom(user.room)        })        cb()    })socket.on(""sendMessage"", (msg, cb) => {        const user = getUser(socket.id)        io.to(user.room).emit(""message"", generatemsg(user.username, msg))        cb()    })socket.on(""sendLocation"", (location, cb) => {        const user = getUser(socket.id)        console.log(user)        io.to(user.room).emit(""locationurl"", generateLocation(user.username, `https://www.google.com/maps?q=${location.latitude},${location.longitude}`))        cb()    })//connection dropsocket.on(""disconnect"", () => {        const user = removeUser(socket.id)        console.log(user)        if (user) {            io.to(user.room).emit(""message"", generatemsg(`Admin ${user.username} A user  has left`))io.to(user.room).emit(""roomData"", {                room: user.room,                users: getUserInRoom(user.room)            })        }})})server.listen(PORT, () => {    console.log(""server s up"" + PORT)})So skipping the import statement and jumping right to the socket part lets understand basic terminologyio.on(“connection”): Here is where we set up Socket.IO. It is listening for a ‘connection’ event and will run the provided function anytime this happens.io.emit(“event_name”): to send a message to all the connected clients. This code will notify when an event occurs to the server.io.to(“socketId”): when we want to emit to only a particular client in that case we can use io.tosocket.on(“disconnect”): When the connection is dropped the disconnect event will fire.Summing up, we are creating a connection and then we are executing code for two events if occur from the client-side i.e sendMessage and sendLocation.HTML page<!DOCTYPE html><html><head> <title>ChatJS</title> <link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""/css/style.css"" /></head><body><div id=""message""></div> <form id=""chat""> <input type=""text"" id=""msg_text"" name=""msg_text"" /> <input type=""submit"" value=""Send!"" />  </form><button id=""getLocation"">Send location</button><script src=""/socket.io/socket.io.js""></script><script src=""/js/chat.js""></script></body></html>Our index, for now, will only deal with a div called message that is where all the messages exchanged in the chat will be arranged. Then, we have soon after a form with a text box and the button of message sending. A very simple chat structure so far. So using our client-side js now we will send our current location and messageClient-Side Js:const socket = io()const $msgForm = document.querySelector(""#chat"")const $geoLocationButton = document.querySelector(""#getLocation"")$msgForm.addEventListener(""submit"", (e) => {    e.preventDefault()let msg = document.querySelector(""input"").valuesocket.emit(""sendMessage"", msg, (error) => {                if (error) {            return console.log(error)        }console.log(msg ,'Message delivered!')    })})// sending current location$geoLocationButton.addEventListener(""click"", () => {    if (!navigator.geolocation) {        return alert(""no browser supoport"")    }navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition((position) => {socket.emit(""sendLocation"", {            latitude: position.coords.latitude,            longitude: position.coords.longitude,        }, (location) => {            console.log(location, ""location shared"", position)        })})})So here we have written client-side js, as we can see right now our UI is not there which I am skipping and provide the Github repo. So when a particular event will occur we send this message to the server-side and we will display this message in the console.Demo:Conclusion:So that’s the end of our app. As you can see is pretty simple and it doesn’t require tons of code as I thought before building it.The power of Socket.IO extends to more solutions that previously relied on back-end pages.

Maintainable JavaScript — Loops and Variables,https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/maintainable-javascript-loops-and-variables-b5d500becd1a?source=tag_archive---------14-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Kevin Oetiker on UnsplashCreating maintainable JavaScript code is important if want to keep using the code.In this article, we’ll look at the basics of creating maintainable JavaScript code by looking at various block statements and declaring variables.The for-in LoopThe for-in loop is used for iterating over the properties of an object.Instead of defining control conditions, the loop goes through each property and returns the property name in a variable.For instance, we can use it by writing:for (const prop in object) {  console.log(prop, object[prop]);}object is the object, prop is the property key.The for-in loop gets all the properties in the object itself and all its prototypes.So we may end up with results that we don’t expect.Therefore, we want to use the hasOwnProperty method to check if the property is in the method.For instance, we can write:for (const prop in object) {  if (object.hasOwnProperty(prop)) {    console.log(prop, object[prop]);  }}Some style guides, like Douglas Crockford’s requires the hasOwnProperty in for-in loops.Both ESLint and JSHint warns us when we use for-in loop without the hasOwnProperty method.A common mistake is to use the for-in loop to iterate over an array.For example, we shouldn’t use the for-in loop to loop through an array:const values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];for (const i in values) {  console.log(values[i]);}This is because the order isn’t guaranteed.And it’s not its intended purpose.The for-in loop is for treating over keys of the object and its prototype.The for-of LoopThe for-of loop lets us iterate through an iterable object.This is the loop that we should loop through an array.For instance, we can use it by writing:const values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];for (const val of values) {  console.log(val);}val is the entry of the array.We can loop through any iterable object, so we can loop through maps and sets.For example, we can write:const values = new Set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);for (const val of values) {  console.log(val);}and:const values = new Map([  [1, 'foo'],  [2, 'bar'],  [3, 'baz']]);for (const val of values) {  console.log(val);}We can destructure the keys of a map:const values = new Map([  [1, 'foo'],  [2, 'bar'],  [3, 'baz']]);for (const [key, val] of values) {  console.log(key, val);}This is the recommended loop by many style guides like ESLint and Airbnb.Variable DeclarationsVariable declarations can be done with the var , let or const keywords.var is the old way to declare variables.We should use let and const since they’re block-scoped and they’re only available after they’re defined.const variables also can’t be reassigned.For instance, instead of writing:function doWork() {  var result = 20 + value;  var value = 30;  return result;}We write:function doWork() {  const value = 30;  const result = 20 + value;  return result;}We use const as many as places as we can so the variables can’t be reassigned accidentally.Photo by Markus Spiske on UnsplashConclusionThe for-in loop is only used for iterating through the keys of an object.The for-of loop is for iterating through any iterable object.Also, var should no longer be used for declaring variables.JavaScript In Plain EnglishNew JavaScript + Web Development articles every day.Follow52 ProgrammingWeb DevelopmentTechnologySoftware DevelopmentJavaScript52 claps52 clapsWritten byJohn Au-YeungFollowWeb developer.

Reactstrap — Navigation,https://medium.com/dev-genius/reactstrap-navigation-630d3937e02f?source=tag_archive---------15-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Museums Victoria on UnsplashReactstrap is a version Bootstrap made for React.It’s a set of React components that have Boostrap styles.In this article, we’ll look at how to add a navbar and nav with Reactstrap.Basic NavbarWe can create a navbar with various components put together.For instance, we can write:import React from ""react"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";import {  Collapse,  Navbar,  NavbarToggler,  NavbarBrand,  Nav,  NavItem,  NavLink,  UncontrolledDropdown,  DropdownToggle,  DropdownMenu,  DropdownItem,  NavbarText} from ""reactstrap"";export default function App() {  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = React.useState(false);const toggle = () => setIsOpen(!isOpen);return (    <div>      <Navbar color=""light"" light expand=""md"">        <NavbarBrand href=""/"">app</NavbarBrand>        <NavbarToggler onClick={toggle} />        <Collapse isOpen={isOpen} navbar>          <Nav className=""mr-auto"" navbar>            <NavItem>              <NavLink href=""/foo/"">foo</NavLink>            </NavItem>            <NavItem>              <NavLink href=""https://example.com"">example</NavLink>            </NavItem>            <UncontrolledDropdown nav inNavbar>              <DropdownToggle nav caret>                options              </DropdownToggle>              <DropdownMenu right>                <DropdownItem>option 1</DropdownItem>                <DropdownItem>option 2</DropdownItem>                <DropdownItem divider />                <DropdownItem>reset</DropdownItem>              </DropdownMenu>            </UncontrolledDropdown>          </Nav>          <NavbarText>more text</NavbarText>        </Collapse>      </Navbar>    </div>  );}Narbar is the whole navbar container. We can change the color with the color prop.light makes the color light.expand has the breakpoint to expand the navbar to the full navbar.NavbarBrand has the brand name or logo.NavItem has the nav itemNavLink is a link on the navbar.UncontrolledDropdown is a dropdown.We need the nav and inNavbar props to make it fit within the navbar.DropdownToggle has the dropdown toggle.NavbarText has the text.NavbarToggler has the toggle for the navbar menu.We put them all in the Collapse component so that they collapse when the breakpoint is less than the one specified with expand .NavbarTogglerNavbarToggler should be after the NavbarBrand so that it appears on the right.We can flip the order to have it appear on the left.For instance, we can write:import React from ""react"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";import {  Collapse,  Navbar,  NavbarToggler,  NavbarBrand,  Nav,  NavItem,  NavLink} from ""reactstrap"";export default function App() {  const [collapsed, setCollapsed] = React.useState(true);const toggleNavbar = () => setCollapsed(!collapsed);return (    <div>      <Navbar color=""faded"" light>        <NavbarBrand href=""/"" className=""mr-auto"">          app        </NavbarBrand>        <NavbarToggler onClick={toggleNavbar} className=""mr-2"" />        <Collapse isOpen={!collapsed} navbar>          <Nav navbar>            <NavItem>              <NavLink href=""/foo/"">foo</NavLink>            </NavItem>            <NavItem>              <NavLink href=""https://example.com"">GitHub</NavLink>            </NavItem>          </Nav>        </Collapse>      </Navbar>    </div>  );}to add a navbar with the Navbar component.Then we add the NavbarBrand and NavbarToggler win the order we want.It takes an onClick prop to let us toggle the navbar by setting the collapsed state.NavA Nav component is another component for navigation.For instance, we can write:import React from ""react"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";import { Nav, NavItem, NavLink } from ""reactstrap"";export default function App() {  return (    <div>      <Nav>        <NavItem>          <NavLink href=""#"">foo</NavLink>        </NavItem>        <NavItem>          <NavLink href=""#"">bar</NavLink>        </NavItem>        <NavItem>          <NavLink href=""#"">baz</NavLink>        </NavItem>        <NavItem>          <NavLink disabled href=""#"">            disabled          </NavLink>        </NavItem>      </Nav>    </div>  );}We have the Nav component with the NavItem and NavLink components inside it to add the links.Also, we can just nest the NavLink with the Nav component by writing:import React from ""react"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";import { Nav, NavItem, NavLink } from ""reactstrap"";export default function App() {  return (    <div>      <Nav>        <NavLink href=""#"">foo</NavLink>        <NavLink href=""#"">bar</NavLink>        <NavLink href=""#"">baz</NavLink>        <NavLink disabled href=""#"">          disabled        </NavLink>      </Nav>    </div>  );}The disabled prop disables the NavLink in both examples.Photo by Museums Victoria on UnsplashConclusionWe can add navbars and navs easily with Reactstrap.They’re responsive so they work with all screen sizes.Dev GeniusCoding, Tutorials, News, UX, UI and much more related to developmentFollow75 1 Sign up for Best StoriesBy Dev GeniusThe best stories sent monthly to your email. Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

How To Create An AR Treasure Hunt using A-Frame and AR.js,https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/ar-treasure-hunt-using-a-frame-and-ar-js-dcd07c33f771?source=tag_archive---------16-----------------------,"Web Development,Mobile App Development,Augmented Reality,Nodejs,Arjs","mridulrb/AR_Treasure_Hunt_using_A-Frame_and_AR.jsContribute to mridulrb/AR_Treasure_Hunt_using_A-Frame_and_AR.js development by creating an account on GitHub.github.comPhoto by Lena De Fanti on UnsplashWhat is WebVR?WebVR is an experimental JavaScript application programming interface (API) that provides support for virtual reality devices, such as the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, Google Cardboard, or OSVR in a web browser. This API is designed with the following goals in mind:• Detect available Virtual Reality devices.• Query the device's capabilities.• Poll the device’s position and orientation.• Display imagery on the device at the appropriate frame rate.WebVR makes it possible to experience VR in your browser. The goal is to make it easier for everyone to get into VR experiences, no matter what device you have. (https://webvr.info/)What is A-Frame?A-Frame is an open-source web framework for building virtual reality (VR) experiences. It is maintained by developers from Supermedium (Diego Marcos, Kevin Ngo) and Google (Don McCurdy). A-Frame is an entity-component system framework for Three.js where developers can create 3D and WebVR scenes using HTML. HTML provides a familiar authoring tool for web developers and designers while incorporating a popular game development pattern used by engines such as Unity. (https://aframe.io/)What is AR.js?AR.js is a JavaScript framework providing an efficient Augmented Reality solution on the Web acting as a port of the AR Toolkit while leveraging other packages like a-frame and three.js.MarkersAn important feature of AR.js is the possibility to use custom markers, the default type is ‘pattern’.AR.js uses artoolkit, and so it is marker-based. artoolkit is a software with years of experience doing augmented reality. It supports a wide range of markers: multiple types of markers pattern/barcode multiple independent markers at the same time, or multiple markers acting as a single marker, up to you to choose.Criteria for creating your own marker -• They must be square in shape.• They cannot have white/transparent areas, only black and light grey (e.g. #F0F0F0)• They have to contain simple text, like one letter, a number, or a symbol.To create your own markers, go to (https://jeromeetienne.github.io/AR.js/three.js/examples/marker-training/examples/generator.html)Two default markers are — hiro & kanjiInstallation GuideWindows1.

If all Builders are hidden, also hide the speech bubble, but if any Builder is visible, keep the speech bubble.function hideSpeechBubbleIfNoMarker() {  var shouldHide = true;  for (var i = 0; i < builders.length; i++) {    var builderMarker = document.querySelector(""#"" + builders[i].name + ""-marker"");    if (builderMarker && builderMarker.object3D.visible) {      shouldHide = false;      break;    }  }  // hide speech bubble};Keeping Track of Player InventoryThe final piece to our treasure hunt was keeping track of which treasures the player had found. We defined several classes: Builder, Tool (aka treasures), and UserState.The Builder class had fields for name, tool, initial dialogue, and alternate dialogue for after the user has found the treasure. The “tool” field was the treasure associated with that Builder. The Tool class had fields for name and dialogue. And finally, UserState had an array containing the inventory of treasures that the player had clicked on. Every time the player clicked a tool, that tool would be added to the UserState. And every time the player clicked a Builder, we would check whether the tool associated with that Builder was in the UserState. If so, we would show the alternate dialogue.function UserState() {    this.tools = [];}UserState.prototype.addTool = function(tool) {    this.tools.push(tool);}UserState.prototype.hasBuilderTool = function(builder) {    return builder.tool && this.tools.includes(builder.tool.name);}var userState = new UserState();ReferencesAR Treasure Hunt — https://www.womenwhocode.com/blog/building-an-augmented-reality-treasure-hunt-with-a-frame-and-ar-jsTowards AIThe Best of Tech, Science, and Engineering.Follow299 Sign up for Towards AI NewsletterBy Towards AITowards AI publishes the best of tech, science, and engineering.

For over half a year, I have gained an amazing experience and knowledge that might not be available anywhere else. I believe that deciding to join Garena was a great decision and I feel really lucky to be part of them for a while.In this article, I’m going to share my journey as an Intern Frontend Web Developer at Garena. After reading this, you will also know the reason why you should take a chance at joining Garena.How did everything start?Everything started when I was looking for a company to do my internship program. There was a job fair at my university that invites a lot of companies and help students to find their place to do their internship. There were a lot of big companies there, however, I had a bigger ambition. So, I tried to inquire to the HR of Garena to know whether there was an intern opening or not. Luckily, there was and I immediately applied as an intern web developer.How was the hiring process?The hiring process started when I sent an email with my curriculum vitae attached, sent to the Human Resource team of Garena. A few days later, I got my invitation to the Web Developer Intern interview process which was scheduled the very next day. The online interview started with the manager asking me about my experience in the web developing world and the projects that I have done. The next stage was about solving some backend-related code problems which revolve around the understanding of Git, Algorithm, Data Structures, and SQL. I felt confident that I could do it well and my confidence turns out to be right, in less than 3 days I got an email saying that I was welcomed to be part of the Garena’s Web Developer team. I was overflowed with joyfulness, it was one of my favorite moments in that year.Why you should join Garena?There are so many reasons why I said joining Garena was a great decision, these paragraphs below will help you to know why.It Just Feels IncredibleDo you know what is the best feeling in the world you can ever experience apart from taking off your socks after a long day of using it? Yes, it is doing something that you love to do while getting paid well, it’s especially true when you work for a very prestigious company. Working here just felt so incredible because of the feeling that you know that you had made it to one of the biggest tech companies in Indonesia. That’s what I felt everyday, happiness, pride, and also determined. Why determined? This brings us to the next topic very well.At Garena, Your Work is Used by Users from All Over The World.Yes, you read it right. This is one of the reasons why I was so determined was because of this, that the product, which in my case the website that I built from the ground-up was used by millions of people throughout the world. This is a unique experience that not many interns from other companies have, this is something for Garena interns to be proud of. However, this also gave me pressure to create a flawless and responsive website, luckily there is something that eases up the pressure well, and that is…A Great Working CultureHere, although coming from different universities, everyone blends well. I especially adore the willingness of seniors to share knowledge and experiences, and everyone’s desire to learn from each other. I also love the fact that everyone, including the manager, tries to make the working condition as fun and enjoyable as possible. pssst…we also have a group dedicated to sharing memes.Garena Web Developer TeamBesides all the amusement that working there gave, they also made sure that you learn well. For every one or two interns, they have provided an experienced mentor that helps you grow. Their help means a lot especially when you have tried to solve a problem yourself and even stack-overflowed it but still, you can’t seem to find the solution.These things make you know that…You Are Valuable HereAs an intern, you will be treated in the same regard as to the full-timer. Which means, your opinion stands too in the meeting. And of course, you will also get facilities and benefits that full-timers have.The first benefit that most of the other companies don’t have is free lunch and dinner, in every meal, they also provide you with some additional supplementary food such as ice cream and assorted fruits. To make your days more delightful, they also provide you with an unlimited supply of milo, either hot or cold one (yum!), and of course unlimited snacks. This is especially important because Garena Indonesia’s office is located in Jakarta’s one of the most expensive areas.Garena’s Office is Inside of FWD TowerSecondly, they make sure of your well-being. Whenever you are feeling drowsy, you can rest for a while at one of the bean bags available in the office. There are even pool tables available that you can use outside the working time.Third, they organized some great internal activities frequently. During my 7 months internship, I had experienced so many interesting activities. Starting from a treat to All U Can Eat restaurant by the manager, and then twice of virtual dinner where we got a 100k voucher to be spent on food that we would eat it together while we were talking together in a virtual room. We also had something called “WebDev Day”, it was an online event where every member of the Web Developer team shared their idea or technique that would make Web Developing easier.Last, you will get a sizeable amount of salary for the internship level, higher than the other internship positions at other companies. All of these things make sure that you feel appreciated and you can work at your highest level of performance.So What Did I Do There?All of that seems fun, but you still don’t have an idea what I did right? Alright, even though, in the interview I applied as a Backend Web Developer, my manager moved me to Frontend Web Developer to help the team temporarily, luckily I got the skills needed to thrive.One of my project: Voting System of an Online CompetitionIn the beginning, my first project is to create SEA Scholarship Website which is used as a website to give information on the SEA Undergraduate Scholarship. Then, I have two more projects done in the office before COVID-19 forces us to work from home. A few months later, I have done several other projects that took my Frontend and Problem Solving skills to the next level. Some of those projects are used as a means to promote users the newest event or gives the users ability to buy in-game items at a discounted price of one of the games of Garena. Speaking of which, the tech stack for Frontend Web Developer that Garena uses are HTML, CSS, and ReactJS. For the full detail on my projects for Garena, look up here: my-Garena-portfolio.Cherry On TopFinally, these last 7 months have been a real treat for me. I feel thankful for Garena to give me this opportunity. This internship has given me great experiences and knowledge that will certainly be helpful for my future.Written byNiko PratamaFollowInternshipsGarenaWeb DevelopmentFront End DevelopmentIndonesiaMore from Niko PratamaFollowMore From MediumScratching That Itch… We’re Talking SabbaticalsJodi ten BohmerNot getting a promotion can be soul crushing.

Best Features of ES2016,https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/best-features-of-es2016-6b7a61fac242?source=tag_archive---------18-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Fahim on UnsplashSince 2015, JavaScript has improved immensely.It’s much more pleasant to use it now than ever.In this article, we’ll look at the best features of ES2016.Array.prototype.includesThe includes array instance method is added in ES2016.It lets us check if an item exists in the array.For instance, we can write:[1, 2, 3].includes(1)then that returns true .If we have:[1, 2, 3].includes(6)then it returns false .It takes the item we want to check and returns a boolean.includes is similar to indexOf .So:arr.includes(x)is mostly the same as:arr.indexOf(x) >= 0The main difference is that includes can check for NaN , but indexOf can’t.So if we write:[NaN].includes(NaN)then that returns true .But if we have:[NaN].indexOf(NaN)then that returns -1.includes doesn’t distinguish between +0 and -0.So if we write:[-0].includes(+0)then that returns true .Exponentiation operator (**)The exponentiation operator is added to ES2016.It lets us do exponentiation without calling Math.pow .For instance, if we have:3 ** 2we get 9.So:x ** ydoes the same thing as:Math.pow(x, y)We can use ** with = .So we can write:let num = 3;num **= 2;then num is 9.PrecedenceThe exponentiation operator binds very strongly.So if we have:2**2 * 2then that’s the same as:(2**2) * 2It binds more strongly than * .And * binds more strongly than ** .Photo by Tadeusz Lakota on UnsplashConclusionES2016 is a small update to ES2015, which was a big release.It gives everyone a break on new features for a year.New features include the array instance includes method and the exponentiation operator.JavaScript In Plain EnglishNew JavaScript + Web Development articles every day.Follow52 ProgrammingWeb DevelopmentTechnologySoftware DevelopmentJavaScript52 claps52 clapsWritten byJohn Au-YeungFollowWeb developer.

Maintainable JavaScript — Separate HTML and JavaScript,https://medium.com/dev-genius/maintainable-javascript-separate-html-and-javascript-e4dfd06438de?source=tag_archive---------19-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by David Rotimi on UnsplashCreating maintainable JavaScript code is important if want to keep using the code.In this article, we’ll look at the basics of creating maintainable JavaScript code by looking at loose coupling between JavaScript and HTML.Keep HTML Out of JavaScriptWe should keep our HTML code out of our JavaScript.Having HTML in our JavaScript code make the app hard to debug when there’re any text or structural issues in our code.It’s almost impossible to trace issues with dynamic HTML in our JavaScript code.Therefore, we shouldn’t write code like:const div = document.querySelector(""div"");div.innerHTML = ""<h3>Error</h3> <p>Invalid date.</p>"";Embedding HTML strings in our JavaScript is a bad practice.It complicates tracking down any text or structural issues,It’s hard to look through the DOM inspector in the dev console of our browser to fund the issue since it’s updated dynamically.Therefore, it’s harder to work with than tracking down simple DOM manipulation issues.The 2nd problem is maintainability.If we need to change the text or markup, we’ve to change the HTML and the JavaScript code to change the text.This is more work than changing them all in the HTML code.The markup in JavaScript isn’t accessible for changes.This is because we don’t expect HTML in our JavaScript code.It’s much more error-prone to edit markup than it is to edit JavaScript since the markup is in string.So by putting HTML in our JavaScript code, then we complicate our problem.There are ways to insert HTML with JavaScript in a loosely coupled manner.One way is to use some templating system like Handlebars.For instance, we can write:<script src=""https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/handlebars@latest/dist/handlebars.js""></script><script>  const template = Handlebars.compile(""<p>{{firstname}} {{lastname}}</p>"");  console.log(template({    firstname: ""james"",    lastname: ""smith""  }));</script>We include the Handlebars library and then call Handlebars.compile to return a template function that lets us interpolate expressions in a template string.If we want to use HTML with Handlebars, we add a special script tag:<script src=""https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/handlebars@latest/dist/handlebars.js""></script><script id=""entry-template"" type=""text/x-handlebars-template"">  <div class=""entry"">    <p>{{firstname}} {{lastname}}</p>  </div></script>Then we can add the following JavaScript to compile the template into HTML:const source = $(""#entry-template"").html();const template = Handlebars.compile(source);const context = {  firstname: ""james"",  lastname: ""smith""}const output = template(context);$(""body"").append(output);The script tag has the text/x-handlebars-template type to distinguish it from a JavaScript script tag.So we can compile the template into HTML.The compilation is done by getting the script with jQuery.Then we call Handlebars.compile to compile the source.The context has the variables we want to interpolate in our template.Then we call template with the context to compile the data.Finally, we call append with the compiled template.Alternatively, we can use frameworks like Vue, React, or Angular to structure our apps so that we won’t have to worry about mixing HTML and JavaScript is a disorganized way.The frameworks make us write code in a way that there’s loose coupling between JavaScript and HTML.Photo by Simon Rae on UnsplashConclusionWe should keep our HTML code out of our JavaScript code.This way, we won’t have to worry about tracking code that’s hard to debug.We can separate them with templating systems like Handlebars or use frameworks like Angular, React, or Vue.Dev GeniusCoding, Tutorials, News, UX, UI and much more related to developmentFollow77 Sign up for Best StoriesBy Dev GeniusThe best stories sent monthly to your email. Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

How to automate Linkedin endorsements with python and be happy like a child,https://medium.com/@xcrazy333/how-to-automate-linkedin-endorsements-with-python-and-be-happy-like-a-child-1e04aa86cb4d?source=tag_archive---------20-----------------------,"Python,Selenium,Happiness,Automation,Web Development","IntroductionHello all. If you are registered in Linkedin I suppose that some of your friends may ask you to endorse their skills, it`s not a big deal when your friend have about 10 skills to endorse.ProblemImagine that you have more than 1 friend (attention it is a joke) that asked you to endorse and each have ~25 skills.Skills list looks like this:To endorse 1 skill we must type plus button:And at least close this annoying popup.PainSummary: to endorse 1 skill we must type two buttons and move cursor to another skill (optional).2 clicks per skill * 25 skills * 10 friends = 500 clicksThat is boring and takes a lot of time that we can spend on automating this task to make our friends more happy (:D)Hope and preparationsThis task can be automated with this tech stack:Python 3.8SeleniumChrome Web driverI`ll use for this task Ubuntu 20.04.Let`s create virtualenv and install selenium package (githhub):virtualenv envsource env/bin/activatepip isntall selenium2. Then we need to download and install chrome webdriver. You can get all files and info here.3. Create .py filetouch endorse.py 4. We are ready to make some magic :)Some requirements and alghoritmIt`s my first attempt with selenium so my code can don`t use seleniu mbest practices, I`ll leave link to gitlab so you can fork this project :)I want to create simple script that takes username, password, link to linkedin member to endorse.Alghoritm:Get parameters from terminal like YOUR_USERNAME, YOUR_PASSWORD, LINK_TO_MEMBER.2. Login in Linkedin.3. Go to Linkedin member page.4. Scroll to show more button (Selenium can click on element only if you can see it in browser window). Show and get list of all skills.5. Endorse them one by one.Solution!SetupLets import needle packages and write function to get variables from terminal.sys — to take args list from terminalgetopt — to take arg that we needimport getoptimport sysfrom time import sleepfrom selenium import webdriverfrom selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keysfrom selenium.webdriver.common.action_chains import ActionChainsdef setup():    input_params = getopt.getopt(sys.argv[1:], ""u:p:l"")    if len(input_params[0]) != 3:    print(        ""Correct input is 'python endorse.py -u username -p  password -l link_to_linkedin_member""    )    sys.exit(1)    username = input_params[0][0][1]    password = input_params[0][1][1]    link_to_linkedin_member = input_params[1][0]    delay_in_seconds = 3    driver = webdriver.Chrome()    return username, password, link_to_linkedin_member, delay_in_seconds, driverNote: we need delay to make sure that page elements is loaded.2. LoginAdd this code after setup functiondef login_to_linkedin(driver, user_name, password):    driver.get(""https://www.linkedin.com/"")    element = driver.find_element_by_id(""session_key"")    element.send_keys(user_name)    element = driver.find_element_by_id(""session_password"")    element.send_keys(password)    element.send_keys(Keys.RETURN)Here we find fields for username, password, type your data and send form.3. Go to friend`s pageLet`s merge our previous code and make sure that everything is good.Paste this code after previous function.if __name__ == ""__main__"":    user_name, password, linkedin_user, DELAY, driver = setup()    login_to_linkedin(driver, user_name, password)    # Go to friend`s page    driver.get(linkedin_user)    sleep(DELAY) Now we can run it and see how selenium will login at your account and open friend`s page.python endorse.py -u username -p  password -l link_to_linkedin_member4. Scroll to show more button and press itNow we need to find button scroll to bot of the page slowly to invoke Linkedin`s page loading, then we need to “Show more” and scroll back to “Show more” button with offset, because Linkedin have floating header part, and, finally, click at it.Paste this code after login_to_linkedin functiondef scroll_to_show_more_button_and_press_it(driver):    tmp = 0    for next_height in range(    PREVIOUS_SCROLL_HEIGHT := 0, MAX_SCROLL_HEIGHT := 1600,    SCROLL_STEP := 200    ):    tmp += SCROLL_STEP    driver.execute_script(f""window.scrollTo({PREVIOUS_SCROLL_HEIGHT}, {tmp})"")    sleep(DELAY)    # Find ""Show more"" button    show_more_button = driver.find_elements_by_class_name(       ""pv-skills-section__additional-skills""    )    # Scroll to it    driver.execute_script(        f""window.scrollTo({show_more_button[0].location['y']},  {show_more_button[0].location['y']-150})""    )    show_more_button[0].click()5. Endorse your friend !Now we can find all endorsements buttons, but I don`t find way to detect if skill was endorsed, so we will unendorse it and then endorse again (weird but works). Trigger that skill was successfully endorsed will be annoying popup menu. After all we need to scroll to another skill with offset.def perform_endorse(endorse_button):    """"""    If skill is endorsed - we must unendorse and endorse it again.    It action invoke popup with endorsements descriptions - we use it like   'succcess message' that we endorse skill :)   Args:   endorse_button ([selenium element]): [button that we must press    until skill will be endorsed]   """"""   driver.execute_script(       f""window.scrollTo({endorse_button.location['y']},    {endorse_button.location['y']-150})""   )   endorse_button.click()   sleep(DELAY)   try:       close_modal_button = driver.find_element_by_class_name(           ""artdeco-hoverable-content__close-btn""       )   close_modal_button.click()   except Exception:       perform_endorse(endorse_button)6. Merge all function to mainif __name__ == ""__main__"":    user_name, password, linkedin_user, DELAY, driver = setup()    login_to_linkedin(driver, user_name, password)    # Go to linkedin user`s page    driver.get(linkedin_user)    sleep(DELAY)    # Scroll to skills list (we need this coz Linkedin dynamicly loads this info)    scroll_to_show_more_button_and_press_it(driver)    # Find endorsements buttons    endorsement_buttons = driver.find_elements_by_class_name(       ""pv-skill-entity__featured-endorse-button-shared""    )    sleep(DELAY)    # Endorse skills one by one    for endorse_button in endorsement_buttons:        perform_endorse(endorse_button)Result code you can also download/fork from gitlab:git clone https://gitlab.com/danil_vorvul/linkedin_auto_endorse.gitFinishNow you can endorse your friends automatic and don`t care how talented they are :)python endorse.py -u username -p password -l link_to_linkedin_memberThanks for reading.

Firebase provides different services such as real-time database, file storage, authentication, hosting, remote configurations, messaging and etc services.You don’t need to use AWS. Firebase has ready and easy to go services. You don’t need to buy a server or VPS to host your web application. Firebase makes hosting easy. You can deploy Web APIs to the firebase independent of the programming language.In this article, I will explain how to deploy your HTML, CSS, JavaScript web applications in Firebase Hosting Service.1. Create a Firebase AccountGo to the https://firebase.google.com/ website and sign in with google account. Go to the console. Choose Add ProjectCreate the project and continue1. Add ProjectNow you need to install the Firebase tools via npm to host your project on Firebase hosting. Make you have node installed.Open a terminal in the root of our project folder and execute:npm install -g firebase-toolsAfter the firebase-tools installation, we must log in to our google account. In the terminal, and execute:firebase loginEnter your Google account credentials.After login in, we need to initialize a new firebase app for our project. In the terminal, execute:firebase initChoose HostingNow will ask you to choose the target project. Chose the existing project you created previously (for this tutorial, it is great-application):create app directory and move all files there. Update Firebase JSON.hosting: the name of the cloud service.public: the folder containing the assets that will be published.ignore: the files that NOT will be upload to the server.3.

Asynchronicity: An Intro to Asynchrony in JavaScript,https://medium.com/swlh/asynchronicity-an-intro-to-asynchrony-in-javascript-66a22c52cd8e?source=tag_archive---------22-----------------------,"JavaScript,Asynchronous,Coding,Flatiron School,Web Development","image source: ABC New YorkHere’s a scenario: imagine you’re the CEO of a wildly successful new company. You have a luxury office at the very top of a high-rise in your city of choice. You are absolutely drowning in money and fame. Unfortunately, you are also drowning in work. Now, you have three things to do before you attend a meeting with your employees in an hour. First, you need to create a spreadsheet for the company’s budget. Second, you need to have your assistant pick up any company mail from the mailbox downstairs. Third, you need to email your new budget to the company’s investors.So you get to work in Excel, and after forty minutes you’ve got your monthly budget planned out. You call your assistant, and tell them to go down to the first floor and get your mail. And then you wait… and wait… and wait. Twenty minutes later, your assistant comes back, dripping with sweat. The elevators are out of order, and they’ve just had to jog down and up ten flights of stairs. You now have to rush to your meeting, and your stockholders won’t receive the budget until afterwards!Except, that’s not what a hard-working entrepreneur would have done, is it? Sitting there twiddling your thumbs while your assistant did your errands would be an enormous waste of time. While they were braving the staircase, you could just as easily have emailed out your budget, and had time to spare!Congratulations, snazzy new business exec! You’ve just uncovered a concept called asynchrony.Sorry; no relation to the Police albumTo start to tie this back into JavaScript, let’s try illustrating the previous list of tasks in pseudo-code.const investors = [""Warren Buffet"", ""Bill Gates"", ""Tony Stark"", ""another famous rich person""]createBudget();haveAssistantGetMail();investors.forEach(investor => {   emailBudgetTo(investor);}In this example, haveAssistantGetMail() is an asynchronous function. In other words, it’s a function that JavaScript knows may take awhile, so while it’s running, JavaScript will go ahead and move on to the next line of code. The code in this block will actually be executed in the following order: first, createBudget() is run. Next, JavaScript starts running haveAssistantGetMail(). While this is happening, the next code block involving emailBudgetTo() is going to be executed. Officially, haveAssistantGetMail() isn’t finished running until after that code is run. So, in terms of our metaphor, our assistant isn’t going to come back into our office until after we’ve emailed the budget to everyone. Examples of actual asynchronous functions in JavaScript include fetch() and setTimeout().The pluses of using asynchrony are clear: it’s efficient, it saves time, and it allows us to execute more complex code without worrying too much about load times. But, like any effective tool, there is some danger in using it incorrectly.In our business-related extended metaphor, there’s no real relation between haveAssistantGetMail() and the emailBudgetTo() code block, except that they are both part of our code. Our ability to email our budget is not affected by the presence of our assistant in our office, nor is it affected by whether or not we have gotten our mail for the day. But what if it was? What if one of the pieces of mail we were expecting was, in fact, the list of our investors? In that case, we couldn’t email out our budget until after we got our mail.const investors = [];createBudget();haveAssistantGetMail();investors.forEach(investor => {   emailBudgetTo(investor);}function haveAssistantGetMail() {   getListOfInvestors();}Because we already know that haveAssistantGetMail() is asynchronous, and won’t finish running until after the rest of our code has, we can extrapolate that emailBudgetTo() will be firing… exactly zero times, since it will still be responding to an empty array of investors. This block of (pseudo-)code will not result in all of our tasks being done!There are a couple of ways to work around this so that our code works as intended. One of the most up-to-date is to use .then():const investors = [];createBudget();haveAssistantGetMail()  .then(){     investors.forEach(investor => {       emailBudgetTo(investor);     }  };function haveAssistantGetMail() {   getListOfInvestors();}.then() ensures that the code block within will not execute until after the asynchronous function it follows is finished. In this case, the code is essentially acting as if it were not asynchronous at all: the emailBudgetTo() code block will not fire until after haveAssistantGetMail() finishes running. This format allows us to wait to send out emails at until after our list of investors has arrived. Of course, in doing so, we’ve ensured once again that our work is going to take longer than an hour… fortunately, in actual Javascript, most code is going to fire in milliseconds!To learn more about asynchrony:Asynchronous JavaScript in Mozilla’s JS DocumentationAsynchronous Programming in Eloquent JavaScriptAsynchrony and Promises on JavaScript.infoThe StartupMedium's largest active publication, followed by +723K people.

From Static to Dynamic CSS Values,https://medium.com/better-programming/from-static-to-dynamic-css-values-23b2d258f60d?source=tag_archive---------23-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,CSS,UX,Software Development","Overly enthusiastic switches — SourceWhile working on a Google Chrome extension, I found myself in need of a toggle switch. These are the little guys you’ll most commonly see on your phone or tablet to enable/disable things.Finding the Right SwitchSo I quickly set out in search of one that I could easily integrate into what I was building. One of the first places I looked at was Google’s Material Design, where sure enough, they had a switch component that I could install and use with just a few lines of code.Once I got to playing around with it, however, I soon realized that I wasn’t completely happy with the way their switch behaved. And since all the styling and functionality are abstracted away inside the package files, it’s not very easy to make modifications.And so I came upon a simple switch implementation, made up of just a few lines of HTML and a single CSS file for all the styles.HTML and CSS for a toggle switch with static styles — Adapted from W3SchoolsThe bad news? The switch was too big. The good news? It was infinitely customizable.Switch: “I’m just big-boned”Rescaling Without WarpingSo, no big deal, right? All I needed to do was make the switch smaller while making sure that its aspect ratio remains the same. For that, as for most other matters in life, I had my trusty aide: cross-multiplication.The real MVPIn essence, cross-multiplication can be used to find an unknown given two equal fractions. What this means for us, is that given two old dimensions, e.g. width and height, we could set a new height and determine its corresponding width.So with that, I could, say, set the height property of the .switch selector to a smaller20px instead of the default 34px and then calculate the new width as (old width*new height)/old height or (60*20)/34. The same would apply for all other values, in that they would be recalculated relative to the .switch selector’s height property value. Thus, the more general formula would be new value=(old value*new height)/old height.Note that the decision to use the .switch selector’s height property value as the basis for calculating all other values is arbitrary. One could just as well pick any other property from any other selector.Replacing Static with Dynamic ValuesOne way of doing this is to calculate the new values individually by hand and then hardcoding the results into the stylesheet.The problem with doing it this way is that you lose a ton of flexibility. If you decide later that the new size is too big or too small, you’d have to recalculate everything. Luckily, we have CSS’s calc() function.A CSS snippet showing the .switch selector now using calc() to dynamically calculate its valuesWhen using the calc() function, be mindful of how you use units! In the case of multiplication operations, at least one operand has to be a unitless number (e.g. calc(5px*5) not calc(5px*5px)). For division, the right-hand side also has to be a unitless number (e.g. calc(5px/5) not calc(5px/5px)). These rules, as well as others, must be followed in order for the expressions to be valid. Click here for more on working with units in calc().Applying the same principle to all the styles, we end up with this:Refactored styles for the switch using CSS variables and dynamic valuesYou’ll notice that in the final version I’ve used CSS variables to add a bit more structure to the overall code.Now I can easily try out different sizes for the switch, simply by changing --slider-new-height.Thanks for reading!

За 2017–2018 гг. в федеральном суде почти втрое увеличилось число дел, касающихся веб-доступности. Это говорит о растущей актуальности этой проблемы для пользователей. Следовательно, владельцам сайтов также придётся принимать этот фактор во внимание.Учитывая всё вышесказанное, трудно поверить, что, согласно руководству по обеспечению доступности контента (WCAG), более 98% сайтов в интернете до сих пор не являются доступными. WCAG — источник истины в вопросах веб-доступности, к стандартам которого обращается сторона защиты практически во всех связанных с этим судебных разбирательствах.Так почему же так много сайтов всё ещё испытывает проблемы с доступностью? Вероятно, потому, что проще не тратить время и силы на понимание её правил. Когда разработчики и дизайнеры не учитывают доступность в работе, легко появляются ошибки, на которые потом просто не обращают внимание. В этой статье мы рассмотрим пять наиболее часто игнорируемых проблем с доступностью и разберёмся с их решением:недостаточный цветовой контраст;неверная иерархия заголовков;отсутствие текста в атрибуте “alt” или внутри ссылки;отсутствие индикации при фокусе с клавиатуры;отсутствие якорных ссылок на основное содержимое.Недостаточный цветовой контрастСлева — недостаточный цветовой контраст, справа — достаточныйFails - Не соответствует требованиямPasses - Соответствует требованиямContrast ratio - Коэффициент контрастностиRequired contrast - Требуемый уровень контрастностиВ чём суть проблемы?Вовсе неудивительно видеть цветовой контраст в этом списке — это одна из самых часто встречающихся проблем с доступностью в интернете. Цветовой контраст является недостаточным, когда текст на странице сложно отличить от его фона, что затрудняет пользователям чтение.Кого она затрагивает?Недостаточный цветовой контраст представляет огромную проблему для слабовидящих пользователей, из-за которой они, скорее всего, не смогут разглядеть содержимое страницы. Если недостаточность контраста выражена слишком сильно, контент может стать нечитабельным даже для людей с идеальным зрением. Правильная настройка цветового контраста обеспечивает лучшие условия визуального восприятия не только для слабовидящих, но и для зрячих пользователей.Какие правовые риски возникают?Если ваш сайт не соответствует стандартам по цветовому контрасту, это может нести определённые риски для вашей компании. Согласно спецификации WCAG 2.1, для того чтобы сайту была присвоена степень соответствия AA (уровень, используемый в качестве ориентира в большинстве судебных разбирательств по вопросам доступности), его минимальный коэффициент контрастности для текста или изображений текста должен быть равен 4,5:1. Для крупного текста минимальное значение коэффициента — 3:1 (пункт спецификации — Success Criterion 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) — Критерий соответствия: Контраст (Минимальный)).Как её решить?Для начала проведите аудит сайта с помощью специального инструмента (например, этого), чтобы обнаружить все области с недостаточным контрастом. На основе этого вы сможете должным образом отрегулировать цвета текста и фона.Неверная иерархия заголовковВерная иерархия тегов заголовковВ чём суть проблемы?Нарушение семантической последовательности заголовков в DOM может создать проблему для многих пользователей. Некоторые веб-дизайнеры и разработчики лишний раз не задумываются, когда используют <h3> сразу после <h1>. Такое может казаться просто мелкой недоработкой, но дела пойдут куда хуже, если заголовки разных уровней в случайном порядке бездумно разбросаны по странице. Заголовки особенно важны для тех, кто пользуется скринридерами: если такой пользователь перемещается по странице с помощью уровней заголовков, необходимо верно выстроить последовательность этих уровней, чтобы она была понятна.Кого она затрагивает?Правильная иерархия заголовков в DOM особенно помогает незрячим пользователям, использующим скринридеры. Но также имейте в виду, что верные уровни заголовков крайне важны абсолютно для всех пользователей, ведь без этого они просто не смогут понять ваши заголовки.Какие правовые риски возникают?В спецификации WCAG нет требований для семантической иерархии заголовков — это одна из причин, почему на эту проблему так часто не обращают внимание. Уровни заголовков могут нести правовые риски разве что в том случае, когда иерархия нарушена настолько, что порядок вашего сайта становится непонятен пользователям.Как её решить?Убедитесь, что первый заголовок вашей страницы — это всегда <h1>, за которым идёт заголовок строго из следующего уровня иерархии. То же самое касается и остальных тегов: ниже их может стоять заголовок, отличающийся не более чем на 1 уровень.Если размеры заголовков требуют полного редизайна сайта, можно пойти более простым путём — использовать атрибут aria-level в тегах заголовков. В качестве значения этот атрибут принимает строку с числом, соответствующим уровню, который вы хотите задать заголовку в DOM. Рассмотрим пример ниже:<h3 aria-level=”2”>Визуально этот заголовок будет стилизован как <h3>, однако в DOM-модели и при считывании скринридером он будет соответствовать тегу <h2>. Естественно, такое решение поможет только в том случае, если ваши заголовки уже были организованы в логическую последовательность, и вы просто использовали не те теги. Если же последовательность заголовков неверная, лучшее решение — реорганизовать их так, чтобы они образовали правильную иерархию.Отсутствие текста в атрибуте “alt” или внутри ссылкиПлохой пример alt: “Изображение горы”. Хороший пример alt: “Цветущие вишнёвые деревья на переднем плане и заснеженная гора Фудзияма на заднем плане”В чём суть проблемы?Отсутствие текста в атрибуте alt или внутри ссылки — одно из грубейших нарушений правил веб-доступности. Текст в alt позволяет интерпретировать изображения как текст. Когда вы не добавляете в атрибут alt какой-то полезный текст, вы оставляете незрячих и слабовидящих пользователей в полном неведении относительно того, что хотите показать аудитории. Отсутствие текста внутри ссылки может быть ещё более серьёзной проблемой, особенно если ссылка играет на сайте важную роль. Если незрячий с помощью клавиатуры захочет выполнить действие, связанное со ссылкой, в которой нет текста, сделать это будет практически невозможно.Кого она затрагивает?Отсутствие текста в атрибуте alt или внутри ссылки создаёт большие трудности для незрячих, которые используют для навигации скринридеры. Многие из таких пользователей предпочитают перемещаться по сайту с помощью списка ссылок. Если ссылка не содержит текста, то пользователь не сможет понять, куда она ведёт. Кроме того, изображения без атрибута alt для таких людей совершенно бесполезны.Какие правовые риски возникают?Те, кто не решает на своём сайте проблему отсутствия текста в alt или внутри ссылки, очень сильно рискуют. Уже в первом разделе спецификации WCAG говорится о том, что всё нетекстовое содержимое должно иметь текстовую альтернативу (пункт спецификации — Success Criterion 1.1.1 Non-text Content — Критерий соответствия: Нетекстовое содержимое). Там идёт речь, в том числе и о изображениях и ссылках. Также необходимо иметь в виду, что если пользователи могут размещать на вашем сайте свой контент, то, согласно ATAG (Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines — Рекомендации по созданию доступных инструментов разработчика), вы несёте ответственность за соответствие их контента стандартам WCAG.Как её решить?Что касается текста в атрибуте alt, необходимо убедиться, что он есть у всех изображений на сайте, причём это не должен быть какой-то случайный текст: плохой текст в alt так же бесполезен, как и его полное отсутствие. Иногда, если текст некачественный, он может негативно сказываться на опыте пользователя. Важно, чтобы содержание атрибута alt было достаточно подробным, но не слишком длинным.Ссылки иногда не содержат никакого текста. В таких случаях можно применять атрибуты aria-label или aria-labelledby, чтобы задать ссылкам необходимую текстовую альтернативу. Значение aria-label — строка, которую прочтёт скринридер в качестве метки ссылки. Атрибут aria-labelledby позволяет передать строку с id элементов, которые содержат необходимый текст для метки ссылки.Отсутствие индикации при фокусе с клавиатуры.class-name:focus {  outline: 3px solid orange}В чём суть проблемы?Ещё одна проблема, которая делает навигацию по сайту практически невозможной для целой группы пользователей, — это отсутствие индикации при фокусе с клавиатуры. Когда пользователи пытаются перемещаться по сайту, на котором нет индикации фокуса, с помощью клавиши TAB, они не могут понять, в какой части страницы находятся.Кого она затрагивает?Для зрячих пользователей, вынужденных использовать клавиатуру из-за нарушений моторики или травмы, которая не позволяет полноценно двигать конечностями, индикатор фокуса — единственное, что позволяет им ориентироваться на странице. Если индикатора нет, такие люди просто не могут пользоваться сайтом.Какие правовые риски возникают?Отсутствие индикаторов фокуса на сайте может нести риск для компании. В спецификации WCAG говорится, что любой элемент интерфейса сайта, к которому можно получить доступ с клавиатуры, должен иметь видимый индикатор фокуса (пункт спецификации — Success Criterion 2.4.7 Focus Visible — Критерий соответствия: Видимый фокус).Как её решить?Владельцам сайтов, которые не особо сильны в вопросах доступности, иногда просто не приходит в голову пройтись по сайту с помощью клавиши TAB и посмотреть, что происходит. А это, между прочим, очень важный этап в тестировании доступности сайта. Нужно опробовать навигацию с помощью клавиатуры и убедиться, что вы можете выполнить все действия, которые могут понадобиться пользователю вашего сайта. Если в процессе вы обнаружите, что что-то сделать не получается, то вам определённо стоит принять меры по улучшению доступности сайта с клавиатуры. Этот простой тест поможет выявить и множество других проблем с доступностью, например “клавиатурный капкан” или нелогичную последовательность переходов. Как только вы выясните, есть ли на вашем сайте индикаторы фокуса, то сможете тут же добавить недостающие.Keyboard trap (""клавиатурный капкан"") - ситуация, когда пользователь не может убрать фокус с элемента с помощью клавиатуры и поэтому ""застревает"" на нём.Отсутствие якорных ссылок на основное содержимоеПример сетки с якорными ссылкамиSkip to Content - Перейти к контентуMain Content - Основной контентВ чём суть проблемы?Один из моих любимых трендов доступности на современных сайтах — добавление якорных ссылок на главную часть страницы. Когда пользователь приходит на сайт, первое, что он видит в верхней части страницы, скорее всего, не является основным контентом. Как правило, наверху располагается шапка с навигацией и списком ссылок на остальные страницы сайта. Тем, кто пользуется сайтом с клавиатуры, придётся пройтись по всему списку ссылок, чтобы добраться до нужной. Якорные ссылки на основное содержимое позволяют пользователям сразу пропускать части сайта, которые в обычных условиях им пришлось бы прокручивать вниз с помощью TAB, чтобы найти нужный контент.Кого она затрагивает?Как правило, такие якорные ссылки оказываются наиболее полезными для зрячих и незрячих пользователей, которые используют клавиатуру для навигации по сайту. Для таких людей единственный способ ориентироваться на странице — это прокручивать её клавишей табуляции или пользоваться скринридером, чтобы переместить фокус на определённую область экрана. Добавление якорных ссылок может избавить пользователей от необходимости перебирать всю навигацию или разбираться в продвинутом функционале скринридера — чтобы попасть туда, куда нужно, достаточно кликнуть по ссылке наверху страницы.Какие правовые риски возникают?Спецификация WCAG не требует добавления якорных ссылок на основное содержимое, поэтому, если на вашем сайте их нет, вам ничего не грозит. Из-за этого многие владельцы сайтов не считают необходимым добавлять такие ссылки на сайт, в то время как они могли бы очень пригодиться тем, кто пользуется сайтом с клавиатуры. Это особенно актуально, если навигация состоит из большого числа ссылок, и по ним неудобно перемещаться из-за такого количества.Как её решить?Вы можете установить кнопку “Пропустить меню” или “Перейти к главному” в верхней части страницы. Нажав на неё, пользователь сразу переместится к началу основного содержимого или к первому элементу с возможностью фокусировки внутри основной части страницы. Есть несколько разных способов оформления якорных ссылок, но я не буду здесь подробно останавливаться на них.ЗаключениеВопрос доступности становится всё более актуальным в современном интернете, и мы как разработчики и дизайнеры должны делать всё, чтобы соответствовать требованиям времени. Лучшее, что мы можем сделать для улучшения доступности наших сайтов, — быть в курсе дел в сфере доступности, а также знать и использовать спецификацию WCAG. Если бы все владельцы сайтов потратили немного времени на решение 5 перечисленных мной проблем, сегодняшний интернет был бы гораздо доступнее.Читайте также:Ускорьте создание пиксельной графики в 10 раз ✨💫Три примера, когда не стоит использовать стрелочные функции JavaScriptProxy — сокровище JavaScriptЧитайте нас в Telegram, VK и Яндекс.ДзенПеревод статьи Marcello Paiva: Top 5 Most Overlooked Accessibility IssuesWritten byVictoria LikhanovaFollow1 1 1 AccessibilityWCAGWeb DevelopmentNuances Of ProgrammingMore from NOP::Nuances of ProgrammingFollowОбразовательные статьи и переводы — всё для программистаRead more from NOP::Nuances of ProgrammingMore From MediumАннотации для параллелизма в Java: наш подход к расцвечиванию потоковРудольф Коршун in NOP::Nuances of ProgrammingТОП — 5 советов, как улучшить свои UI навыкиTeya Manasherova in NOP::Nuances of ProgrammingСборка и запуск загрузчикаIuliia Averianova in NOP::Nuances of ProgrammingFake-объекты практичнее mock-объектовIuliia Averianova in NOP::Nuances of ProgrammingUX или UI — на что уделить внимание?Teya Manasherova in NOP::Nuances of Programming5 подводных камней нереляционных баз данныхАндрей Шагин in NOP::Nuances of Programming5 признаков того, что вы тратите свой потенциал разработчика впустуюElena Andenko in NOP::Nuances of ProgrammingКак развернуть пакет Cython в PyPIАндрей Шагин in NOP::Nuances of ProgrammingAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

The Shape of the Text to Come….,https://medium.com/weekly-webtips/the-shape-of-the-text-to-come-77eb4e6ba3bf?source=tag_archive---------29-----------------------,"Front End Development,Web Development,JavaScript,Programming,Software Development","Well anyone who has spent any time doing any kind of graphic design will likely have come across text wrapped inside a shape. I mean at its heart any text in any kind of layout is text wrapped inside a shape, albeit most often we are restricted to the humble rectangle when it comes to web layouts.I am not spouting any kind of revelation here but there will come a day when we may want to wrap or shape our text to something a little more interesting than squares and rectangles, so why can’t we!Well in no small part because it’s not as simple as all that! Those of us who spend more time in Illustrator or Photoshop will likely be wondering what the big deal is. Well as with anything that needs to get through approval by committee, change comes at a slightly slower pace, I mean hell it wasn’t until 2017 that all major browser finally supported CSS grids, an actual usable grid layout for the web! And for that, I am eternally grateful!Well, do not despair it is coming to the web, just not right now….If you go and have a read of the latest CSS draft spec and you will find shape-insideCSS Shapes Module Level 2Specification Metadata This draft contains the features of CSS relating to wrapping content around and inside shapes…drafts.csswg.orgOr dig into the SVG 2.0 draft and you’ll find it there toohttps://svgwg.org/svg-next/text.html#TextShapeInsideSo it is on its way but I wouldn’t hold your breath for its arrival. So what happens before we reach that glorious haven of text wrapping goodness, well we implement it ourselves!So let us take a look at the options we have available.You may have noticed the CSS shape-outside property, which is already supported by most modern browsers.Can I use... Support tables for HTML5, CSS3, etc""Can I use"" provides up-to-date browser support tables for support of front-end web technologies on desktop and mobile…caniuse.comSo……Well yeah, it sort of worksHave a read of this great post on CSS-tricks showing one way to (fake) wrap text inside a circleUsing CSS to Set Text Inside a Circle | CSS-TricksYou want to set some text inside the shape of a circle with HTML and CSS? That's crazy talk, right? Not really! Thanks…css-tricks.comWhich is great, if a little complicated to implement, and honestly I don’t fancy trying it with anything more complicated than a simple circle!So well yeah, why don’t we build ourselves a solution in good ‘ol javascript.tl;drToo much to do, no time to be wasting, no problem!npm install text-in-shapehttps://github.com/crispinanderson/text-in-shapeLive demohttps://codesandbox.io/s/text-in-shape-demo-k7qxmHow Does It Work?Require a string, Require a shape to wrap the text toUse SVG for our shape as it is easy to create and work with ( we could use canvas but I find SVG much easier to work with, as you can generate this easily externally)Convert the shape to canvas (accepted shapes are polygon, rect, circle at this time, I may consider adding paths at a later stage)Calculate line guides for our shape: line.y, line.x, line.width ( here is why we need our shape in HTML canvas as we need the context.isPointInPath method)Add text to line guidesApply any custom options to our lineData such as text alignment and justification and padding.Create our DOM Elements from our lineDataTake a sip of coffee and sit back and relax…Step 1 & 2.Not really steps, more considerations, fairly obvious we will need a string and a shape to use as our wrapper.Step 3: Convert SVG to canvas.Here is a brief introduction to canvas if you haven't used it before.HTML CanvasWell organized and easy to understand Web building tutorials with lots of examples of how to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript…www.w3schools.comFirst, we need to set-up a canvas context that we can draw our converted shape to.Here we are using a foreign object to embed the canvas into our SVG directly which helps us to calculate our positions correctly as our SVG position is taken into account.Now we can convert our shape onto our canvas.Step 4: Calculate line guidesThis is where the magic of canvas context.isPointInPath really comes into play. This allows us to pick a pixel in the canvas and see if it is within our canvas shape. Without this, we would need to be writing our own mathematic functions to calculate the borders of our shapes and manually test if a pixel is within those bounds. Glad to have skipped that headache!Not actually too much going on here, this is a helper function that loops while we are testing pixels within our shape (bounding box) and returns the line positions when complete. Note it takes into account the width of our first word and our optional padding values.Notice the minWidth variable which will ensure our first word fits inside our first line, which will minimize any dead space at the start of our text.Now the heavy lifting is done by our calcInPathPoints function.The basics of creating guides for our wrapped text is to check if the four corner of a line top-left, bottom-left, top-right, and bottom-right fit inside the shape at a given line-height. We do this calling the isPointInPath from our canvas context.It makes sense to find our starting line length from the length of the first word of the string that is passed to avoid having potentially multiple blank lines and instead have a starting y at the minimum pixel height that would allow our first word to fit within the shape.Other than that the only other consideration we need to take into account is that our starting word fits the first line guide, here we pass an optional minWidth parameter to ensure this.We also take into account any padding and create the guides with the padding already removed.Step 5: Add text to lines guides.Her we take our calculated line data and add our paragraphs word by word testing against the DOM to see if how many words per line, we can then append our line data with textWidth and textContent property.I had wanted to minimize writing to the DOM and separate this step, allowing it to be more easily tested in isolation and more performant. Initially, this was implemented by creating a dictionary of character widths and using these to calculate our sentence widths. Sadly this had some reliability issues and would often report a slightly incorrect value which leads to imprecision in aligning and placing the text.So instead we have to rely on writing to the DOM and getting an exact width value this way.Step 6: Apply custom optionsI’m not going to go through the exact implementation here as this has already gone on long enough and there is nothing too exciting there but here we adjust our line data to reflect any positional changes added by applying text alignment or text justification.Step 7: RenderWe simply take our render data, loop through it creating new tSpan elements and append them within our SVG layer, taking into account the SVG bounding box, to correctly set our text group position. Adding the text inside the SVG itself means that our text will scale in size along with our SVG, as we do not want to be re-calculating our text wrapping on every resize, this may become a bit of a drain on our site performance and wouldn’t look very nice as was recalculating. This is one of the major choices we have to make with text wrapping for a resize-able document, re-calculate or scale. The other caveat being that we cannot have text scrolling either as we would also have to recalculate with every scroll to fit our text to the shape, which is maybe not impossible to do smoothly but certainly quite impractical and I doubt would be a very pleasant user experience.Step 8: Take a sip of coffee and sit back and relax…See you next time ;)Thanks for reading, I hope this article was interesting, if not useful, and hey why not let me know your thoughts….or even get involved, text-in-shape is an open-source project.Weekly WebtipsExplore the world of web technologies through a series of tutorialsFollow6 Sign up for 💌 Weekly NewsletterBy Weekly WebtipsGet the latest news on the world of web technologies with a series of tutorial Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

Using Webflow as a software engineer,https://medium.com/@rochouhan/using-webflow-as-a-software-engineer-bc82517ad0a9?source=tag_archive---------30-----------------------,"Web Design,Webflow,Portfolio Site,Web Development,HTML","Photo by Halacious on UnsplashI am a coder. I am a computer science major at Rice University. I have completed multiple web engineering internships. My entire work and future career are in code. Yet, I am in love with the #NoCode web designer tool created by Webflow.Coding is tediousWhen I first started developing websites, I found the process very tedious. First, I would plan out the design with a few sketches on a piece of paper. Then, I would start writing the HTML code to generate the content. If you have ever written HTML, the syntax is quite tedious to write (imagine typing the “<” and “>” character every few seconds). Even after writing all of that pesky HTML code, the content isn’t even designed! I then spend more time styling and arranging the content using CSS. By the time I finish that, I realize my initial plan was not sufficient. It could be that the user flow of the site is off or the content arrangement does not lend itself well to responsive design. In the end, something irked me enough to scrap my original plan.As a result, I have to go back to the drawing board to revise out how I want to put all of my ideas together on a responsive site. Then, I need to remake and restyle, praying I get it right the next time. With a team of engineers and designers, this process of designing, building, and iterating can be quick and seamless. As an individual, however, it is extremely slow and discontinuous. All I want to do is to be able to design, build, and view the result all at the same time.This is exactly where Webflow comes in. Webflow is the best tool to quickly and seamlessly design, build, and iterate websites without writing a single line of code. When I first tried it, it felt like I had web design superpowers.Giving power to the people: blending the worlds of design and engineeringWebflow has too many great features to talk about here, but I will mention some of my favorites.CMSInstead of copying and pasting the same content over and over again, Webflow provides a seamless content management system (CMS) with tons of customizability. It allows you to manage many different data structures such as dates, numbers, text, and even references to other CMS databases. I found this incredibly useful to manage blog posts and work experience blurbs, which all follow the same styling format.Webflow UniversityWebflow feels like Adobe Photoshop but for web creation. It has an insane amount of customization to create, style, and animate all of the content to your exact taste. There are so many tools that it can feel overwhelming. Webflow has put great effort into creating an entire series of educational videos that, in an oddly amusing manner, provide tutorials on how to create different aspects of a website using Webflow. The videos are incredibly enjoyable to watch and provide users with enough context to get going on my projects.Web Designer Pricing PlansWeb designers are empowered by Webflow’s features, especially for those who don’t code. In the multi-website plan, a designer can create a portfolio that can all be hosted on Webflow. When this designer gets clients, they can individually host each site. Webflow offers the ability for monthly billing, so a designer can directly charge their client through Webflow itself. Technically, you can start generating revenue before you pay Webflow a dime!Building a brand with a few clicksI have used Webflow to build my personal website because it allowed me to focus on the design and content rather than the code. I previously tried to use React to make it, but I was bogged down in code to create an elegant design. Webflow changed all of that for me. I have continued to build on it over the years as I leverage this website to build my brand and network in the professional world.Even more, I used Webflow as a landing page for an app I am making. It took less than an hour to create a beautiful site where people could express interest in the app directly through Webflow’s form service.#NoCode to #BetterCoderAlthough I used Webflow to get away from code, I later found myself writing the same HTML and CSS code quickly and efficiently in other projects. Webflow forced me to appreciate the power of visual hierarchies. These hierarchies directly translate to the structure and levels of HTML trees. As a result, I was able to visualize the relationships in the content more easily. Even more, Webflow uses the same CSS styling terminology like margin, padding, text-align, etc. By using Webflow, I learned and understood the relationships of these CSS elements. For example, I could not for the life of me understand flexbox before using Webflow. I can now write CSS code much faster without having to look up each element’s name because I became familiar with the terminology.ConclusionAs you can see, Webflow can provide unlimited tools for those who want to build websites (coders and non-coders alike). Unfortunately, Webflow can only handle building websites with relatively simple functionality (like blogs or static sites). For more complex work like user authentication or connecting to a database, I have found it better to use traditional web frameworks like React. As a result, I continue to build my web development skills every day to create more interesting and exciting sites. Whenever I find the right use case, however, I always return to Webflow because it has a special place in my technology workflow.Written byRohit ChouhanCS @ Rice University, Incoming SWE Intern @ FacebookFollowWeb DesignWebflowPortfolio SiteWeb DevelopmentHTMLMore from Rohit ChouhanFollowCS @ Rice University, Incoming SWE Intern @ FacebookMore From MediumHow I Overcame Imposter Syndrome in TechEric Chi in Better ProgrammingPEG ParsersGuido van RossumWordPress Continuous Deployment and Version Control with BitbucketAlexa Green in The StartupAre CSRFs Still a Thing?Vickie Li in Better ProgrammingFetching Remote Async API with Apple Combine FrameworkAlfian LosariStatic Vs.

"<strong class=""bt"">Top web frameworks in 2020</strong>",https://medium.com/@Ihor.Pavlenko/top-web-frameworks-in-2020-d390eb19abc5?source=tag_archive---------33-----------------------,"Web,Web Development,Web Framework,Framework,Angularjs","Due to the technology increase and rather high attention to the IT-sphere now, with its Elon Mask and his chipped pigs and so on, more and more people turned their sight to the programming. Surely, that’s damn obvious, because the salary is good there even if you are a junior specialist.Working as a dev combines some tech knowledge and skills along with art and creativity. Yep, sometimes it smells like fart and sadness all around but all in all, IT is highly perspective.As I said, a lot of people go to IT and, eventually, they need to choose the right tool or I’d rather say framework to study and start with. And here is the trick, most of jun devs are at a loss what to choose, especially when they just started their way in programming.Knowing this, I’d like to drop some info about the top and the most useful web frameworks in 2020 to master. Let’s get to the main points.AngularJSI think the first language that is necessary to learn and which will bring you money immediately is JavaScript. When you know it, you’ll definitely have some bread and butter at home (and beer maybe).AngularJS is one of the frameworks that is based on JS. It provides various solutions, it has its rules, good and well-structured documentation and guidelines, and constant updates. That’s a good start, as for me. Additionally, now such a process and service as migration from AngularJS to Angular is quite popular. So, when you know how AngularJS functions and learned other versions of Angular it won’t be hard to make more money.ReactJSOne of my favorites. That not a framework, to be honest, it’s a highly technological library that provides you with any sort of solution, support, and help. The learning curve is rather short and easy here, especially when you’ve mastered such a language as JavaScript. ReactJS is a technology that makes development fast, smart, and enjoyable. IT has a large community where everyone can help you. ReactJS is dynamic, easy-to-understand, and fits perfect for beginners. If you ask me which framework to choose in the first steps, I’ll definitely recommend this one.Vue.jsAnother framework that is based on JS. As for me, the more skills and knowledge you have, the more chances to get a better piece of cake. Vue.js is simple, not capricious, easy-to-understand, and learn. Moreover, at the first steps of work, it’s rather good and smooth.For example, Grammarly the service for proper English writing was built with the help of Vue.js. This Framework is underestimated, as for me, but, believe me, fellow devs, it is a dark horse in the world of development and I’m pretty sure that it’s worth mastering.React NativeLet’s be honest. Sometimes our clients want too much and behave like true assholes. One time they want an Android app, another day an iOS app and if you are a dev, it becomes a pain in the ass. But React Native gives you a solution if you need to develop an Android and iOS app at the same time (or it reduces the headache at least:).RN gives you the way, where you can develop one app but for different platforms without a total rewriting of code. It will behave like a native, and everything will work smoothly and nicely. Just a delightful framework and a must-have, if you wanna achieve the top of the devs’ mountain.Angular 2+Oh, this is the variant for truly hardened devs. Such technologies as Angular 2+ are for real masters. That’s not so easy to learn, and sometimes even pretty hard to do so.Angular 2 and other versions are based on TypeScript which is much more powerful than a regular JS. Furthermore, Angular has a strict and strongly regulated environment with its own rules and laws. So, if you wanna use Angular, you need to learn all of that.Be ready to spend a lot of time while learning this framework for it needs that sacrifice. As a result, you will get just amazing skills and opportunities to work on an absolutely new level. Angular has well-structured and understandable documentation, and that makes the process of learning easier. Besides, a new version Angular 10 was released in the middle of 2020, so it also stays up-to-date.That’s it, fellows. Choose your destiny, pick up a framework, and go on! Your results won’t make you wait for long.Written byIhor PavlenkoEnglish/German translator. Student at CNTU.

Day 1 of #100daysofcode: Learning UI Design Patterns,https://medium.com/@kathyjeanjoseph/day-1-of-100daysofcode-5aebd14d7d6e?source=tag_archive---------34-----------------------,"100daysofcode,Technology,Web Development,Careers,Learning","Original Date: July 24, 2020If you’re new here to the #kathycodes journey, let me start off by saying Welcome! 🎉This is my first round of #100daysofcode so I’m starting off as a beginner and I’m learning with Skillcrush — Break into Tech courseI’ll be documenting my journey in several ways, if you want tidbits find me on twitter at @kathyjeanjoseph to view my to the day updates of my journey.Visual? I’m on YouTube and view me in action and a less detailed version of my problems, solutions and takeaways.Today’s Topic: Learning UI Design Patterns.In my SkillCrush course, this particular module is in the Web Design Fundamentals Course.The focus was particularly on defining UI, Intuitive Design & Design Patterns & Trends.Main Notes:User Interface: How your site graphics, layout & text work together to help users find what they need.Intuitive Design: Designing sites that users can figure out on their own.Design Patterns: Pre-built solutions to common web design & UI problems that are proven to work and look great.Design Trends: Popular aesthetic styles that define how things look.User InterfaceUser Interface wasn’t a topic I was unfamiliar with but honestly it’s almost something I know of and not truly know. So becoming familiar with the basic standards and defining characteristics of UI was definitely nice to break into. It ultimately helped me to decide that I want to move forward into UI/UX in the future.Intuitive Design“Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.” - Steve JobsThis is where UI gets tricky because thinking of the million and one ways that one particular person defines and experiences simple as well as the common definitions of items and things that are universally understood takes many deep dives so that the product can be useful and intuitive for the majority. What’s simple for me may not be simple for others.Design Patterns & TrendsPatterns was a new term for me but this felt like trends. This is what all designers do when they scroll through behance.net for ideas.

Make your Website Load Faster,https://medium.com/rm29/make-your-website-load-faster-cbbcfe95cf9d?source=tag_archive---------37-----------------------,"Web Development,Web Design,Loading,Speed,Website","Photo by Glenn Carstens-Peters on UnsplashA slow-loading website is detrimental to any business. Not only does it frustrate customers but it also makes your site harder to find. Slow loading sites are ranked lower by search engines such as Google. Here are 5 steps you can take to speed up your site.1. Cleanup your pluginsPlugins can add crucial functionality to your website, but the more you have the slower it runs. Get rid of plugins that are unessential or no longer being used.2. Be smart about image sizesMost images on your site will still look good in smaller sizes. To decrease your image sizes in Photoshop go to File > Export > Save for Web. Choose a width that is between around 1500–3000px. If the image is displayed small on your website you can choose a smaller pixel size. Experiment until you find the lowest size that still looks good.3. Minify your .js and .css filesMinified files are smaller and faster to load. Here are some sites you can use to minify your files → CSS Minifier | JS Minifier4. Cut down on HTTP requestsTo view your HTTP requests open the developer tools in your browser. In Chrome do this by clicking the three dots in the top right corner > More Tools > Developer Tools, then go to the Network tab. Refresh the page and you will see a list of requests. If any of these are not important to your site get rid of them. In addition, if you have multiple .css or .js files combine them so fewer requests are made.5. Turn decorative images into spritesIf you did step 4, you will notice each of your images requires a separate HTTP request. If you have lots of decorative images that are not important for SEO (eg: logos, mockups, team photos) it makes sense to turn them into a sprite. You can use this tool to combine images into one sprite. Then modify your css rules to display the correct image where you want it.Rm 29Marketing tips and trips to grow your brand and boost sales!FollowWeb DevelopmentWeb DesignLoadingSpeedWebsiteWritten byMiaFollowWeb Developer at Rm29FollowRm 29FollowThese tips and tricks are brought to you by Mia, a web and software developer and Hanieka a graphic designer.

"<strong class=""bt"">We need more commercial creativity from our marketing agencies.</strong>",https://medium.com/@lee_think3/we-need-more-commercial-creativity-from-our-marketing-agencies-76db4cc95b9?source=tag_archive---------38-----------------------,"Marketing,Web Development,Commercial,Strategy","Let’s start with the simple question, can you be both creative and commercial at the same time.In a simple answer, yes.Lee Marples, Co-founder of think3: Creative and Digital Marketing AgencyIt’s not really as straight forward as that though. Creatives tend to be just that, they are Creative, thinking about innovative ways in which we address problems.The problem often that follows is that some of those ideas are not that Commercial or at least there’s no clear evidence to support the creative ideas in how they will impact the business goals.It’s certainly the case that many commercial focused people tend not to be that creative.With an international pandemic and recessions across the world businesses need to expect more from their marketing agency that just their creativeness.Now isn’t the time to engage with a design agency to create your next campaign idea or look for an agency that just does web design. Businesses should be looking for a Commercially Creative agency that talks your own language and understands how and importantly where their creativity has had a commercial impact.The creative industry is one that is highly competitive and varied in terms of what’s on offer and who is offering them.With unemployment rising and most likely will rise further we are already seeing an increase in the number of freelance web developers as well as a rise in the number of creatives that are now looking for work.What makes an agency Creative and Commercial?As a business think3 needed to be different, one that harnesses and promotes the creativity needed to achieve great web design or develop digital marketing campaigns. At the same time it needed to be one that approached every client and project with a commercial focus.Yes we are a Brand Agency, yes, we create online marketing campaigns and design websites that are built to perform.Most design agencies and web design companies can do this. But it’s what comes next that is most important to clients.A new website can have a real impact when you launch it, there are PR opportunities to promote it or a short-term increase in traffic checking out your new site. How do you ensure that you continue to benefit in the long term?Business objectives aren’t set in the same timeframe as a single web development project.Your agency should be supporting you through the longer term. Yes, some short term thinking is needed to react. Big results take time to pay back and that’s where your marketing agency needs to think commercial.Too much data, not enough informationWe live in a world where there are apparently over 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are created each and every day. With every person generating 1.7 megabytes of data each second. That’s a lot of data.Data is a good thing when it comes to marketing right? When there’s so much of it how do you know where to start and can you even cope with that amount of data?The most important thing to do is convert that data into meaningful information. Too often people focus on the statistics and performance of a website for example rather than the information that the data gives — that’s the commercial element.It’s about converting data into meaningful information that can lead to new creative ideas and support marketing in impacting the bottom line. Now that does align to the business objectives.Selecting the right marketing agencyIf you are looking for a short term fix you can find a plethora of marketing and creative agencies that will deliver you a brilliant product and service. If you are thinking longer term you need to seek out the right creative agency.If you’ve never worked with an agency before here are a few questions to consider:- What types of companies do you work with and in what industries or markets do they work in?- What are the core capabilities of your agency? How do you make sure you can deliver us a great service?- How is your pricing determined?- What does a typical relationship look like between your agency and your clients?- Do you have any case studies or testimonials that can demonstrate you are as good as you say you are?One factor that people often overlook when selecting the right agency is the ‘fit’ with your business.Agencies by nature are external and therefore it is important that when selecting the right agency for you, they have a similar approach, similar values and fundamentally they recognise that they are paid to deliver results.Measuring effectivenessWhen marketing is done effectively it’s not about the number of likes on your social media channels or about the volume of visitors to your newly designed e-commerce website. It comes down to what your business delivers.If you are selling a product, how many people actually go on to buy it or how many people look to procure your services.Marketing teams and agencies need to learn to see all of their activities with a commercial eye. They could create the best advertising campaign in the world but without directly impacting the bottom line the effectiveness can’t be measured.Developing a focus on the commercial issues allow agencies, like us, to demonstrate how we add value in a competitive marketplace.The most commercially beneficial ideas are those that are both creative and commercial.If you are looking for the right mix of creativity and commercial thinking get in touch: lee@think3.co.ukWritten byLee MarplesCo founder of think3 | Creative and Digital Marketing Agency, Derby, UKFollowMarketingWeb DevelopmentCommercialStrategyMore from Lee MarplesFollowCo founder of think3 | Creative and Digital Marketing Agency, Derby, UKMore From MediumReward Points Are Out, Integrated Loyalty Programs Are In.Dave Unipan in The StartupHow to Get Your Readers to Follow YouNabil Alouani in Better MarketingDoes LinkedIn even think about B2B commerce?StartupLandHow to Manage Humour in Your Marketingdan brotzel in Better MarketingDon’t Throw Away the Yellow Pages Just YetStephanie Thurrott in Better MarketingHow Starbucks uses psychology to create an unforgettable customer experienceJennifer Clinehens in Choice HackingYou Don’t Need a Lot of Followers to Be a Successful BloggerSergey Faldin in Better Marketing3 Reasons Minnesota Nice is a Terrible Marketing StrategyJohn Gamades in The StartupAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
7 best ways to prevent broken authentication,https://medium.com/@techletterboxb/7-best-ways-to-prevent-broken-authentication-4baf77228761?source=tag_archive---------39-----------------------,"Broken Authentication,Web Security,Web Security Testing,Web Development,Web Security Products","Before looking into broken authentication first will get some basic introduction of attackWhat is broken authentication?In broken authentication, assailants approach a huge number of substantial username and secret key mixes for credentials stuffing, default regulatory record, brute force attack, and word reference assault instruments. Session broken assaults are surely known, especially corresponding to unexpired meeting tokens.The predominance of broken verification is broad because of the structure and execution of most personality and access controls. Session management is the bedrock of verification and access controls and is available in all stateful applications.Assailants can distinguish broken validation utilizing manual methods and endeavor them utilizing computerized apparatuses with secret phrase records and word reference assaults.Assailants need to access just a couple of records, or only one administrator record to bargain the framework. Contingent upon the area of the application, this may permit tax evasion, government-backed retirement misrepresentation, and fraud, or uncover lawfully secured profoundly delicate data.How to check for broken authenticationThese sorts of shortcomings can permit an aggressor to either catch or sidestep the validation strategies that are utilized by a web application.Grants robotized assaults, for example, credentials stuffing, where the assailant has a rundown of substantial usernames and passwords.Grants beast power or other mechanized assaults.Grants default, frail, or notable passwords, for example, “admin@123” or “administrator/administrator”.Utilizations frail or insufficient qualification recuperation and overlooked secret word measures, for example, “information-based answers”, which can’t be made safe.Uses plain content, encoded, or pitifully hashed passwords (Sensitive Data Exposure).Has absent or ineffectual multifaceted verification.Uncovered Session IDs in the URL (e.g., URL changing).Doesn’t turn Session IDs after effective login.Doesn’t appropriately refute Session IDs. Client meetings or validation tokens (especially single sign-on (SSO) tokens) aren’t appropriately nullified during logout or time of inertia.The objective of an assault is to assume control more than at least one record and for the assailant to get similar benefits as the assaulted client.3 broken authentication attack scenariosSituation #1: Credential stuffing, the utilization of arrangements of known passwords, is a typical assault. In the event that an application doesn’t actualize computerized danger or credential stuffing insurance, the application can be utilized as a secret key prophet to decide whether the qualifications are legitimate.Situation #2: Most validation assaults happen because of the proceeded with the utilization of passwords as a sole factor. When thought about accepted procedures, secret phrase revolution and intricacy prerequisites are seen as urging clients to utilize, and reuse, powerless passwords. Associations are prescribed to stop these practices per NIST 800–63 and use multifaceted confirmation.Situation #3: Application meeting breaks aren’t set appropriately. A client utilizes an open PC to get to an application. Rather than choosing “log out” the client just shuts the program tab and leaves. An aggressor utilizes a similar program an hour later, and the client is as yet confirmed.7 preventions for broken authenticationWhere conceivable, execute multifaceted verification to forestall mechanized, certification stuffing, brute force and taken accreditation re-use assaults.Do not deliver or convey with any default accreditations, especially for administrator clients.Implement feeble secret phrase checks, for example, testing new or changed passwords against a rundown of the main 10000 most noticeably awful passwords.Align secret key length, unpredictability, and turn arrangements with NIST 800–63 B’s rules in area 5.1.1 for Memorized Secrets or other current, proof-based secret phrase strategies.Ensure enrollment, certification recuperation, and API pathways are solidified against account list assaults by utilizing similar messages for all results.Limit or progressively delay fizzled login endeavors. Log all disappointments and ready heads when certification stuffing, savage power, or different assaults are distinguished.Use a worker side, secure worked in meeting supervisor that creates another arbitrary meeting ID with high entropy after login. Meeting IDs ought not to be in the URL, be safely put away, and negated after logout, inert, and outright breaks.The above preventions are very much useful to protect broken authentication in web applicationWritten bytechletterbox boxLearner in cybersecurity, for more info visit www.techletterbox.comFollowBroken AuthenticationWeb SecurityWeb Security TestingWeb DevelopmentWeb Security ProductsMore from techletterbox boxFollowLearner in cybersecurity, for more info visit www.techletterbox.comMore From MediumUsing NAT Gateways in AWSZeeshan BaigAt the Core of Cybersecurity are: Risks, Costs, Benefits and Threat ModelsProf Bill Buchanan OBE in ASecuritySite: When Bob Met AliceIs data privacy a market failure?Christopher Koopman in The BenchmarkFifty Shades of Malware HashingThomas RocciaHow To Protect Yourself From The Equifax HackNew York State Attorney General in New York State Attorney GeneralDon’t Mix Up SHA-1 Hashed Passwords with SHA-1 Signed CertificatesProf Bill Buchanan OBE in ASecuritySite: When Bob Met AliceAre CSRF Tokens Necessary?Posh AIParanoia Is Now a Best PracticeTyler Elliot BettilyonAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

Technology enhanced Technologies,https://medium.com/pracas/technology-enhanced-technologies-8cf8383db9?source=tag_archive---------42-----------------------,"Entrepreneurship,Small Business,Web Development,Web Design,WordPress","Technology is updating technology day by day. The updates of firmwares, source code, updates, bug fixing, update of iOS versions, Android versions, firmware updates in IoT Devices, lots of Linux Flavors and Microsoft releasing updates and versions of Windows Operating system from lightweight Windows 95 to Windows 10 with lots of code name, highly used Windows XP to bypassed Windows Longhorn.Few Technologies have been narrated which are essentials things for every business, market and startup. The technology is enhancing technology itself.Website DevelopmentIt’s all about developing a webpage and being creative and growing ideas about new things and implementing it for the future. Websites can be developed from various sources like HTML, CSS, Java Script, WordPress and many more other frameworks. It is also about creating an online presence according to our or the customers view. It may vary from social media’s to the news or a sports page and so on. According to the understanding; website is also a hub which connects various users online over an inter-connected network residing any corner of connected world which is also known as the Internet or online network. Many people nowadays prefer reading news on a technological device rather than the physical copies.A business can get various profits from a website as the inter-connected network also known as the Internet. More than 90 percentages of the people in this world use the Internet and it is also one of the fastest growing technologies.So for this very reason there are many businesses running through an online presence. The more people hit the link of the site the more profit is generated and so the business grows faster. But for this to work we may need to optimize various things and work harder for it. The more number of people that visit the website the more profit is generated; website helps visitors converting them into leads and then after sales.Search Engine OptimizationAccording to the latest update of Google algorithms, RANKBRAIN is the major factor which analyzes the rank. Apart from Google there are few competitors like Bing, DuckDuckGo, Yandex Search and more. The keywords, meta tags, proper content, dwelling time of website visitor manages the proper rank in search results & determines the way people search things over the internet like a simple things to deliver their rich experience of crawled results over cyber sphere.A guy searching for best college in any city or country after his school, searched on the internet for the best colleges over the Internet. Whenever people search place over the internet they use common and regularly used words or any pieces of words or sentence which has been already crawled and managed by Google Bots where no human but a command of million lines of codes are used to generate language as system which is known as Artificial Intelligence which sometimes called as Machine Learning Method. The best example would be Google, whenever we type some words Google automatically suggests some references which is also known as a Search Suggestions. It is one of the world’s most trending thing as there are billions of websites around the Internet and also is a challenge for the user’s to optimize their page in such a way that it makes it to the top of the listings of the things that you search.There are countless websites found on the internet today, but not each one of them are successful and in order for it to reach countless number of peoples and businesses must need to have a SEO in order to ensure that they are one of the competitors on the global market and they also need to update certain keywords over and over again to make it more successful.Concept WritingDocumentation of vision which means to plan, manage, application, textual matter, narration and writing all your ideas on a note with proper details or something detailed report of any project, plan, vision & any service or business. Since it is also about brainstorming for new things and creating new ideas which can become a habit later and who knows one of your ideas may change your Future. It is all about implementing ideas that may change the world of technology or how technology can transform the world with new innovations. Many famous personalities have already mentioned about writing a one new idea each day to enhance the capability of a person’s cognitive capability.In order to generate various new ideas and concepts; an idea, plan or vision must be changed to a concept note so that later in the future maybe one of their concepts may shake the whole world. Without a vision or an idea no one can grow forward and make their organization run rocket success.StartupA thousand mile of journey starts with a first step likewise any tiny idea with a group of innovative people or anyone and after several feasibility studies will work over it. Startups are also a kind of implementing your creativity and ideas over a project with a whole lot of dedication and through various surveys which may ensure the security risk of the startup that we are working on. It is also one of the emerging platforms for many peoples in today’s world to start a company based on their ideas. But it doesn’t mean that one can only start a company using his ideas, instead he can also take other client’s ideas and implement it.Entrepreneurship is all about creating new ideas and working on it and also about helping other people from that very own idea. Jack Ma the founder of Alibaba.com researched a lot during his early days but now he is one of the main figures in the world of Information Technology, which was also one of the startups and few lists are Amazon, UBER, Tesla, Foodmandu, Tootle.Startups are a major thing these days as it is rapidly growing and a lot of best brains are coming up with a lot of creative ideas. Above mentioned companies were all startups at their starting phase. Who had thought that a company like Apple started from a garage would take over the entire world and that too in a rapid growth.WordPress Solutions34% plus of the websites around the world are developed using WordPress and is one of the easiest thing to build a website. WordPress was started as Blogging platform earlier days but its full fledge CMS for almost everyone where any IT Student can make a good blog or a great programmer can handle huge visitor on his website. It is one of a very good platform for several designers wanting to create a webpage. And since there are various pages created via this platform that still is on the Internet which is developed using this platform.It is easy to use, several themes, templates, custom coding can be made in WordPress platform. Most of the major web hosting companies, cloud VPS companies supports one click WordPress installation on their webhosting panel.WordPress has major two versions which comes as Gray & Blue, blue as commercial version of WordPress and gray as open source. The customized and managed service provided by WordPress is WordPress VIP.Growth Hacking“Buy one get one free.” An oldest but still running concept to double your sales in single transaction. When Sabeer Bhatia of Hotmail started free web based email service, his team started placing auto signature as “Create Free Email account” which helps to get more signups day by day later on Hotmail was acquired by Microsoft in USD 400 million. It is about attracting customers towards any product, service, brand or something which enhances the sales. It is also about how you change the way people buy your products. It is almost in everything but very few people notices about it. The biggest example maybe The Mercedes Benz’s logo which many other automobile companies applied later on. The Big STAR. The lighting Apple logo in Mac. There are many things like the Apple’s and the Alienware logo which also falls under this.It is one of the most attracting feature of growth hacking as it is pretty catchy and people are often attracted towards these kinds of offers. Even if we walk on the street and don’t notice anything but it’s certain that our eye will sure catch these kinds of offers. Customers are often attracted to schemes that may seem like a good deal like the 50% discount offers to the buy one get one free ones.Digital Media MarketingSelling, promoting & branding any products through any means of digital media like Facebook, Instagram, Mass Email, Bulk Email, Google Ads, Facebook Advertising etc are known as Digital Media Marketing where any area, group, interest, demograph, place, age group, gender, interest, event etc can be targeted easily. In a single line; marketing your own business over the internet.In today’s world media marketing is one of the trending World-wide ways to sell your products online and is reaching many people over the Internet where boarders are not boundaries. It is also about how you attract people sitting in one corner of the world and selling in another corner. The way you advertise your product, market it and make global brand over the Internet.Like for example Google AdS which is also a platform for digital media marketing and many users use it to promote products online and also the ads that comes up on YouTube is also an example of Digital Media Marketing or the ads that comes on your phone whenever you use a certain application.Targeted marketing is a way of attracting audiences based on their searches and frequently asked questions and their internet browsing history, once can find out their interest and target them for the advertisements where cookies plays a vital role to track visitors history to show relevant ads.Business emailIt is about setting up an email address to different organizations for intercommunications which is safe and secure for the organization as they will have their own personal business email .Through this way they can inter communicate easily with each and every departments of an organization from marketing department to the finances and many more. It is about creating each and every individuals email based on the organization. And with this we can also setup the automatic reply function for the users if they aren’t available or are on leave.When an organization hires an employee for sales department, he creates email on Gmail, Hotmail or Yahoo! As firstnamelastname32@gmail.com, the things goes well, email works as blazing speed but when he decides to leave the company the companies owner may not be able to trace back the data, conversations, contacts from his mails and in another hand when the employee leaves his email to his leaving organization he has to hand over his personal data, browsing history, photo backups, data stored in Google Drive, his core information saved in Google Password and more his various system connected or verified with email while his subscription in any personal social media account, banking login details and private emails sent by his friends and family but if the organization has its own personal email sales@organisation.com.np then it is possible for the organization to transfer as well as access all the mails or handover to new employee without any hassle.Application ArchitectIt is all about creating a system of how an application is designed and developed. Typing few words on this keyboard will print text in Microsoft Word, the frontend process can be easy but there needs to be a great architect to run it like how it is made, and not only the keyboard but also the screen and the other surrounding entities around me like from the speaker to a simple pen and pencil .It’s like a blueprint of the structure of the house we make.Before any system is made it is very necessary to ensure all the required feasibility studies are done and also surveys are done in order to find out what is needed the most for the general user’s regarding the system, and also the feedback collection.A system architect is a person that designs the blueprint of a system from the most low to the high details. Basically an Architect is also the one who makes the various architectural designs like EDM diagrams, flowcharts and so on. This is called a system architect similar to a civil engineer who makes the model of the building or bridge that he is going to build and how he process on to make it.Website RedesigningGiving new look to existing domain name, changing layout, implementing new codes and scripts. Adapting new technologies to perform task easily. It is about updating website accordingly to the user’s choice. It is about implementing new ideas and updating it regularly according to the customer’s choices and demands. If a customer says he needs a new feature regarding a certain thing then the developer should work over it and redesign it according to the customers thought. Basically it is like updating the old website with new looks, features etc.Website redesigning is necessary in order to ensure that an organization keeps on competing on the global market from its other competitors, and also to raise its stock on the share market to a high level.Corporate BrandingBranding an organization using technology or without using technology but to effect marketing. In today’s world; It is all about digital influence and marketing it through over the internet but few things still remains offline. There are many organizations (Worldlink, NIC Aisa Bank, NTC etc) hoarding boards and digital boards hanging all over the streets, pen stand, flyers, pamphlets, diaries, greeting cards which is one of the way to advertise it to the public and sometime it is necessary to play an advertisement of Coca Cola in heavy, about a certain product. Another example would be that a certain man came up with an idea of using solar power to light up the advertisements that we can see on expressways and highways.In today’s world a product won’t sell until and unless some brandings and advertisements are done. Why do we even use Pepsodent and Colgate when there are various other companies! It is all because the way they present themselves to the world. Marketing is the one of the biggest things to sell products, make brands in this world to sell your products to a huge numbers of people.Training & Curriculum DevelopmentIt is mainly about training and setting up a routine for ourselves about our own self growth and Development. One of the most important things to setup a habit of working over certain ideas. Enhancing skills of employees to perform better.It is basically about listing the things that one would want to work over it again and again to ensure one’s self growth and development. It’s like an army training period that goes everyday without a question.It is necessary to adapt something which is being upgrading in the world rapidly on information technology industry and to ensure that we get updated to it we ourselves need to change. The course & curriculum accordingly to the growing world to stay updated is updating & investing for future. Avoiding this will certainly lag behind the rapid growing world of Information Technology which is the future.Data DigitizationData digitalization is all about creating a database of hardcopies over a certain digital platform. In our country this is the future; since our government has still been using paper works in few ministries & departments and keeping records of various subjects on a file. It can basically be like integrating data in a database and keeping various records of it. In the future it is going to be precious & important things since the country which has the kept the highest number of record may be the next Superpower or the Supreme Country. The more difficult part of practice is getting copy of citizenship, driving license and any records were all written on a file instead o f using a Database and maintaining it regularly to keep it updated. Keeping data on digital format helps to find, share, manage, backup easily and there are various examples of this term which few government agencies & corporate has been practicing from years. Still many things are done using paper works instead of using a platform and that is also one of the reasons.Many data’s around the world are being stolen from us anonymously without even our knowledge like the Face App which was claimed to have stolen various peoples information without even their knowing which can be dangerous as they can know everything about that particular person, so to control it data prevention is necessary so that users can feel safe about themselves. To insecure that the data is being kept safe, data preservation is needed.Google Earth can be a very good example of software to analyze data as it analyzes the searches made by the users and navigates them to the place that they search upon. Many applications are on the mobile phone nowadays that scans the documents which saves the time as like the old days; people won’t have to go to Scanner Machines to scan their documents.Many countries via various applications have already started to gather the data of people around the world. As data is the biggest thing in this world and the more number of access of data you have the more you reach out. Many institutions & agencies collects data using various signup forms to create leads which they plan to convert into customers. In general; “Data is the new currency”. When a system, software, web or a mobile phone application accesses a lot of people’s information regarding their location, phone number, contacts, storage etc.Pracas Upreti — BlogWriting about Entrepreneurship, Startups, Digital Marketing, Technology & LIFE too.FollowEntrepreneurshipSmall BusinessWeb DevelopmentWeb DesignWordPressWritten byPrakash UpretiFollowInformation Technological Geek, Entrepreneur, CEO @ #pracasinfosys , Founder of http://www.sriyog.comFollowPracas Upreti — BlogFollowI have been blogging since 2005, WordPress was mine platform since.

Here, our mission starts to guide you to the best web hosting provider.Bluehost is one of the most popular web hosts today owing to its reliability, uptime, performance, affordability, and its brilliant features that help in your website’s growth.Naturally, you are looking for a web hosting provider with a solid reputation, affordable pricing plans, and impressive features to suit your business needs.Bluehost is probably at or near the top when it comes to all these features. Owned by Endurance International Group (EIG), they are based in Orem and Provo, Utah and cater to over 2 million websites worldwide. This fact alone exhibits their reliance and dependability in the web hosting market.The best part about Bluehost is that it provides an incredible uptime, loading speed, extensive features, affordable pricing plans, and much more.Bluehost has been in collaboration with WordPress for over 10 years and retains support staff that helps out WordPress users. It also invests in an engineering team dedicated to WordPress core development. Thus, Bluehost is therefore in a position to provide its users with reliable and top-notch WordPress hosting.Bluehost ReviewIf you are just starting out, and you are wary about paying out big bucks on web hosting, then Bluehost has you covered. It offers top-notch a hosting plan for $3.95 per month (50% off) along with a free domain name worth $15 for the first year. This is cheaper than transferring a domain from a separate website builder like Weebly, Wix, or Squarespace or a domain registrar like GoDaddy.Bluehost Features Overview:Bluehost provides a complete web hosting solution for everyone. Here is an overview of the web hosting features:Unlimited disk storageUnlimited domain hostingFree drag and drop site builder (new)A free domain name for one yearSupport international domain namesPOP3/POP3 secure email supportIMAP/Secure IMAP email support3 different webmail solutionsForwarding email accounts and unlimited emailsAdd-ons domainsParked domains50 GB of disk space for a WordPress websiteSubdomainscPanel account control panelFTP accessWeb file managerSecure shell (SSH) accessHotlink protectionOverride .htaccess supportMySQL databaseLOD filesSide statisticsCustomizable error pagesCustom Cron JobsSpam assassin protection$200 marketing creditBest Features and Pros of Bluehost:I- 99.9% Server Uptime.Don’t run the risk of losing revenue and offering a poor user experience by investing in web hosting services that could ultimately fail you with their server downtime eventually. The industry-standard uptime for hosting companies is around 99%. Yes, your website has to be seen 99% of the time or else, you are headed for a downfall.Bluehost beats the industry norm and has an overall uptime of about 99.9 per cent, which is more than perfect. And this statistic is valid also for their common lower-level plans.II- Security Measures – Automated Daily Backups.Security or privacy is one of the biggest concerns that most folks have before picking a web hosting service. Keeping this in mind, Bluehost doesn’t cut any corners when it comes to security measures.You get daily backups and website restorations on any Bluehost plan. Many website owners ignore backups until it’s too late despite it being a crucial element.Since Bluehost’s backups are limited, you can upgrade or make use of third-party backup software and have no worries about losing your site’s data. If something goes wrong with your website, recreating everything from scratch will be a mammoth task.Moreover, Bluehost outsources its security protection to Cloudflare, a popular name in the content delivery network (CDN) industry. Furthermore, Bluehost offers plenty of other impressive security measures, such as SiteLock, daily scans to protect against viruses and malware, constant monitoring on servers, a free SSL certificate, password protected directories, and more.III- High-Speed Servers.While Bluehost isn’t the fastest host of all when it comes to server loading, it offers enough speed to suit the needs of most website owners.The loading speed depends on the type of hosting you will be using. For instance, if you go for shared hosting, the load times and response times will be slightly slower than a dedicated server.However, even the lowest hosting package by Bluehost offers competitive server speed – better than others like iPage, but slightly slower than others like A2 Hosting, Siteground or HostGator. You can also opt for bundled tools such as Cloudflare CDN to speed up the loading process.IV- Beginner-Friendly.If the web hosting process is not all that complicated in the first place, Bluehost makes it much less complicated. The best aspect is that Bluehost provides a customer onboard experience that is built to make things simpler for those who are hosting a website for the first time.They have a clutter-free, user-friendly interface and ensures that all the technical elements are well explained.In case you face any difficulties when setting up your hosting, which rarely happens, you have access to a number of tutorials and walk-throughs. They 're going to help you slip through any sticky points efficiently.V- 24/7/365 Customer Support.Bluehost provides one of the most dependable customer support in the industry.You have access to 24/7/365 customer support via numerous platforms, including:Live ChatEmailsTicketing SystemPhone CallsSocial Media SupportTheir phone support option is the easiest way to get in touch with a qualified tech support professional who can help you settle your issues.However, most of the time, you won’t even need any professional help.

Your personal information, ecommerce transactions, and other sensitive data will be protected – all plans come with a free SSL certificate.VII- Money-Back Guarantee.If you are not satisfied with the web host, Bluehost offers a 30-day money-back guarantee; no hidden terms applied.

Tap on it to enter the details and begin the registration process.Step #2 Select a Web Hosting Plan.Next, you will be redirected to a new page where you will see four Shared Hosting Plans, namely Basic, Plus, Prime and Business Pro. Here is a brief breakdown of the features you will get with each one:Step #3 Select a Domain Name.When you choose a plan, you will be asked to enter your domain name. Here, you have two options:Either register a “new domain,” which is absolutely free for the first year. Or if you already own a domain, then choose “I have a domain name” option. Next decide whether you want your website to be .com, .org, .net, and so on.Step #4 Enter your Personal Details & Pick add-onsYou will have to enter details such as your first and last name, email address, password, country, phone number, and so on. Scroll down to the “Package Information” section. Here you can choose how long you want your Bluehost package to last (12, 24, or 36 months) and select a few add-ons. Usual add-ons, include SiteLock Security Find, Codeguard Basic, and Bluehost SEO Tools Start.You are unlikely to require all the add-ons, so make sure to choose only the add-ons that align with your needs.Next, you will also have to pick a payment option. Bluehost offers two payment options – via credit card or PayPal.Step #5 You have successfully signed up with BluehostThat’s it!

It will include all the login details you need to get started.After completing the signup process, you can choose to install WordPress from the cPanel.Bluehost Reviews: Should You Buy It?If you look at a wide variety of features combined with outstanding customer service, I don't see why you shouldn't try it at least once.If you are a startup or a small business, Bluehost is one of the best options you have. Since Bluehost is scalable, you can always upgrade your plan to a higher plan as your business starts to grow.Bluehost continues to rank among the top web hosting service providers when it comes to uptime and loading time. In addition, you get a 30-day money back guarantee, solid security, outstanding customer service, a free SSL certificate, loads of easy-to-use applications, and more. And let's not forget one of the lowest price plans in the industry.However, if you are moving your site from other web hosting services, then you have to make a one-time payment of $149. It might make you a bit wary, but again the services and assistance you get for the sum are worth in the end.Overall, Bluehost offers one of the best web hosting options on the market and gets my full endorsement.Get started with Bluehost today.Written byFast ReviewFollowBluehost ReviewWeb HostingWeb DevelopmentWebHostingMore from Fast ReviewFollowMore From MediumCyberSecurity Lion RepellantGeorgia WeidmanMake Your Passwords Pass MusterE Val5 Effective Ways to Tackle Your Wireless SecurityJohn Teehan in The StartupWhy the NSA Called Me After Midnight and Requested My Source CodePeter Avritch in Data Driven InvestorA Simple Proposal to Help Fix Corporate America’s Cybersecurity ProblemThe New York Times in The New York TimesThreat Hunting with Windows Defender ATPDigitally Vicarious in The StartupThere’s Nothing Inevitable About Apps That Track Your Every MoveACLU National in ACLUMaking SSH Connections on WindowsAmila KalansooriyaAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

What You Should Know Before Hiring A Magento Developer,https://medium.com/@aalphaindia/what-you-should-know-before-hiring-a-magento-developer-b1822719cd3c?source=tag_archive---------47-----------------------,"Hire Developers,Hire,Web Development","Ecommerce platforms have flooded the market, and Magento is just among the best. It is a powerful platform designated for developers as well as businesses. The platform boasts a robust set of factors that are not only limited to security but flexibility, development architecture, scalability, and much more. With Magento, developers can personalize an online store basing on the requirements of clients. This defines the customization that comes with this crucial platform. It is a good practice to understand that online stores and especially the latest ones should adhere to the latest trends to give clients the best services ever. The development of such platforms should embrace the creation of designs that are centralized on users. Furthermore, the platforms should enhance online sales by ensuring proper buying decisions.While everyone focuses on getting the best Magento services, the desire to seek the best Magento developers arise. These experts will build you a website or a platform that puts into consideration most of the customer needs and therefore enhancing customer engagement and user experience. But seeking the rightful Magento developer isn’t just a walk in the park. There are several considerations you should put on board, and the best results will come from the collaboration between you and the developer.The following factors are essential when hiring a Magento developer.Since the platform is coupled with a range of powerful and complex tools, you will need to go for an expert who has vast knowledge in the specialized area. Therefore, it is of great essence to work hand in hand with the Magento developer to come up with a successful online business. The following are vital considerations you should note before hiring a Magento developer.A defined set of requirementsA proper understanding of the project you want to undertake is critical. You must have a clear understanding of the entire project as well as the whole process involved in building your business online. It is just as easy as jotting down a few things involved within the project. You can write down all the requirements for your project and also list the functionality needs for your Magento store. To achieve all these, you need to have a broader view of all the features of Magento.Additionally, you should extend your knowledge to understanding the suitability of your business model. You can contact and research from several development companies. After that, you can hold discussions with Magento experts and understand all they need from you. Such arguments are critical and will help you identify the type of your website. Well, after understanding all these, you will also need to seek clarification on the customization level required for your project, the stages in a Magento e-commerce project, how other websites utilize the platform, the project budget, and much more.Certified Magento developersIt’s good to have an understanding that development is not just about coding. It is way more than that. Apart from coding, a certified Magento developer should have vast experience in designing. Furthermore, the developer should adhere to proper practices that are essential in building any site. Such developers will help you save project costs as well as time spent on the project. Usually, most developers have their areas of specialization. These allow them to showcase outstanding skills that are critical in solving problems in their areas of concern.Therefore, before going for any Magento developer, it is essential to understand their certifications and skills. Some are certified in associate development, front-end development, cloud development, and much more. So, it’s vital to determine and establish the skillset you need to be employed in your project. With such certifications, you will come up with a powerful and productive product and also achieve proficiency in the entire developmental project.Experience of partner companiesA company’s experience is critical in providing the best services in your desired project. The very first considerations you should stick to your mind before hiring any Magento development company is knowledge and experience. With these two, you can achieve a productive and proficient e-commerce store. Companies or individual Magento developers will always provide the best in terms of handling arising issues. The issues can either be technical or day-to-day factors experienced in the entire developmental process. If you want to land an experienced developer, there are several factors you should prioritize. An experienced developer will always have a proper understanding of all your needs. The developer will then work towards completing your project within the stipulated timeframe. They are always advantageous, and they will help you explore other business-related aspects such a branding.Partner Company’s PortfolioBefore you hire any Magento development company or developer, it is critical to keep in mind that portfolio just as important as anything you consider within your project. Portfolios depict a lot and act as volume raisers about development companies. A thorough check through the company portfolio gives you a broader understanding of company skills, their project deliveries, and the approaches used in web development. By getting a clear picture of all these, you can weigh the merits against demerits of different development companies. Portfolio also assures you of whether the company will successfully meet all your business needs. If you have no proper understanding of any company’s portfolio, there are chances that you don’t have the assurance of successful project completion. These will enable you to make a proper choice of company for your business needs.Online Ratings and ReviewsReviews and ratings are a common way of identifying the successes of various platforms, companies, or organizations. There are several review websites essential in assessing the quality of work of Magento e-commerce developers. Platforms such as Clutch are also critical in continuous company auditions. Therefore, before you opt for a Magento developer, you can consider taking a closer look at real client ratings and reviews about those they have partnered with to develop outstanding websites. To determine the best company from reviews and ratings, you can always check on the complexity of the initial development process, the frequency of communication to clients and its effectiveness, the project delivery, project management, adherence to client expectations, and much more.Easy Access to Trained ResourcesSelecting the best Magento e-commerce services requires that you go for a stronger team that’s well acquainted with the latest technological trends. Furthermore, the company should ensure that highly trained resources work on your anticipated project. Developers should familiarize themselves with the latest technologies and tools, as this will enable the provision of the latest services.Mode of CommunicationCommunication, like it is in every other aspect, is a crucial consideration to make before pointing out a Magento developer to work on your project. Frequent communication between the two parties is essential, especially when it comes to making changes and updates to the project. It is, therefore, vital to put the communication factor into consideration before choosing a Magento specialist. The developer should have proper communication skills and be able to interact with clients closely. All these help the developer to understand clients as well as all their business needs. Therefore, before landing a Magento developer, ensure that there will be continuous communication in the entire project.While communication is a factor that holds in every project development process, you should also note that transparency when communicating is of importance. The developer you choose should be capable of executing project inputs quickly and respond via email and other possible means of communication. Usually, Skype, Google Talk, and other communication platforms are used more often. Accessible communication is a determinant of whether you’ll get in touch with everyone at every stage in the entire project development process.Quality versus CostSince the budget is an essential factor to consider, it’s also critical to look at the quality of work a Magento company or developer can provide. It can be a challenging journey establishing a cost-effective company that provides quality work. To make it possible, we can always consider the work requirements and whether it requires a proficient developer. You can also check on the pricing structure, and look forward to situations that can bring about incurring additional charges. Above all, let there be transparency in the costs and quality of work the companies provide.Development TimeUsually, the web development process adheres to achieving milestones while following strict time frames. This calls us to check on the development time each Magento expert can meet. It is also essential to go further and consider how the developer will handle the project in cases of setbacks. Will they be able to adjust their timeline, or will they let the project backfire? It’s advisable to go for experienced Magento developers who will complete your project on time regardless of the setbacks in all stages of development. These experts will always stick to the timeline and ensure the client is happy at all times.Quality Checks and TestingAny development process won’t miss out on testing. Therefore, we must ensure that the code is tested and its function is understood. There should also be consideration of the suitability of the code to business needs. Appropriate testing should be conducted to ensure the achievement of the desired function.Post-development SupportBuilding an online store is not just enough. It is more than that. There should be consistent checks, updating, and much more. Therefore, when you hire a Magento developer, you should go for certified ones who will take a further step in providing post-development support.Safety & SecurityAbove all, put security and safety into consideration. The current world is flooded with cybercriminals who pose a significant threat to organization data and much more. Therefore, the Magento specialist you hire should be well acquainted with safety and security measures. They should be able to protect your website or platform from attacks and the loss of data.Hope you’ve got the idea, for more information feel free to contact Aalpha.Originally published at https://www.aalpha.net on September 19, 2020.Written byAalpha Information Systems India Pvt.

"Learn about Fiber, the new Golang Web development framework.",https://levelup.gitconnected.com/learn-about-fiber-the-new-golang-web-development-framework-3bb2a9375b7f?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Programming,Technology,Software Development,Web Development,Golang","Photo by Emile Perron on UnsplashPersonally, this framework excites me a lot because it is really focussed on web development which I enjoy a lot.It’s a framework inspired by the Node.js Express framework build on top of Fasthttp and as frameworks use to do, it just helps a lot with getting you started to build out your web applications in Go.RequirementsYou will need to have Go installed on your machine. If you are new to Go, I recommend you to check out this beginners tutorial on Go:The Ultimate Go Guide in 2020 for Beginners.Go is an open-source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software. In this…levelup.gitconnected.comGetting StartedTo get started, we create a new Go project which is done as follows, you create a new file called main.go and you enter the following starter code:package mainfunc main() {}To install this framework, run the following command in your command line or terminal/bash:go get github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2That will install the fiber module for you. You can now import this into your main.go file.package mainimport ""github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2""func main() {}Now you are able to use the framework.Create the Fiber AppEmbedded down below is the most simple Fiber app you can imagine, we will go through it individually, line by line:package mainimport ""github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2""func main() {app := fiber.New()app.Get(""/"", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {return c.SendString(""Hello, World!"")})app.Listen("":3000"")}Within the main function you see the following lines of code:app := fiber.new()This initializes a new instance of the fiber app just like with Express in Node.js, it’s actually quite similar so if you have used express before this will be no magic to you.app.Get(""/"", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {This is basically your route line of code, here the routing is done. When you want to use a GET request you use .Get() and when you want to use a POST request, you simply use .Post() . After that, you’ll see a callback function that has a response parameter that is defined as c and after that, possible error handling.return c.SendString(""Hello, World!"")On this line the response will be returned, it’s a simple string that is returned with Hello World.On the bottom line, we see the listening port being 3000 :app.Listen("":3000"")So when you run this server with go run main.go it will start a web server on port 3000 of your localhost and if you visit that address in your browser a simple Hello World text will be displayed.Advanced RoutingLet’s dive into some advanced routing since a simple GET or POST request without any parameters isn’t really handy.So make it clear, this is the most simple route:app.Get(""/"", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {  return c.SendString(""Hello, World!"")})and if you want to make it more dynamic, you can add parameters:app.Get(""/:value"", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {  return c.SendString(""value: "" + c.Params(""value""))})So here, after the / we see :value which is a parameter that can mean anything, it can be a page number, a username, anything. In the return statement, we see that the value of that parameter was returned in the response.Static FilesAs in any other web development framework, we have Static Files to be served on our servers. To create a static file folder we do the following:app.Static(""/"", ""./public"")Very simple, the first argument takes the route and the second one is its path.TemplatesNow let’s move on to the visual part of this framework, adding templates. Because what’s a website without a front end?Golang’s Fiber has an interface for views:type Views interface {Load() errorRender(io.Writer, string, interface{}, ...string) error}Views interface contains a Load and Render method, Load is executed by Fiber on app initialization to load/parse the templates.app := fiber.New(fiber.Config{Views: engine,})The Render the method is linked to the ctx.Render() function that accepts a template name and binding data.app.Get(""/"", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {return c.Render(""index"", fiber.Map{""hello"": ""world"",});})For clarity, you store your template files in a /views folder in your root.ConclusionThis example represents a straightforward Fiber app written using Go. I hope you have learned the basics of Fiber in Go, and you can explore more on this topic.Level Up CodingCoding tutorials and news.Follow232 2 ProgrammingTechnologySoftware DevelopmentWeb DevelopmentGolang232 claps232 claps2 responsesWritten byBryan Dijkhuizen, BA.FollowWriter for The Startup & Better Programming.

Hacking the Medium partner program,https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/hacking-the-medium-partner-program-84c0e9fa340?source=tag_archive---------2-----------------------,"Bug Bounty,Web Development,Hacking,Partner Program","This is the journey detailing how my name was added to humans.txt for scoring my first bug bounty, a severity 2 one at that! Im writing this as i’ve always personally been interested in how people discover security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, vulnerability itself is incredibly easy to exploit, details can be found at the end of this article. (pls scroll slowly so I can rake in some partner program earnings)Back storyI was originally going to write an article describing testing I conducted in an attempt to figure out how much of the $5 monthly fee is given to writers through the Medium partner program. I had planned to test out different interactions which I thought might affect a writer’s compensation. Such as reading the article for different amounts of time and seeing if interacting with the article (through means such as: highlighting text, clapping) would affect the writer’s compensation. Since I am on a shoestring budget I only wanted to pay for a single “control” account to do all my testing from. I originally had 20+ different scenarios I intended to test and could only test a single one per day as Medium Partner Program earnings are calculated daily, I was looking for ways to automate the process. Thus, I went exploring through the chrome developer tools to analyze how data is transmitted back to medium.com to see if it was possible to automate some of my tests.I began by one by one blocking requests to certain url paths that I believed could be transmitting the metrics used to calculate my partner program earnings. After a lot of trial and error I discovered that it was requests to medium.com/_/batch that was transmitting all the data used to calculate my partner program earnings.a screenshot of some of the data transmitted back to medium HQ through /_/batch endpointI didn’t have any way of figuring out what a lot of the data transmitted back to the medium.com/_/batch endpoint represents, I had at the time planned to perform a replay attack of the requests made to this endpoint only modifying timestamp data to make it relevant to the time the replay attack is launched (which could be days after I initially captured all the requests made to this endpoint).Since I didn’t want to copy-paste all my cookies into the python script I was writing to preform my replay attack. I tried clearing my browser of all cookies after loading the webpage, Without any of the cookies present and being transmitted to medium.com/_/batch I was still able to generate partner program earnings. I then attempted to analyze the request JSON data to see if I could simply generate all the post request data required for a session of an arbitrary duration at once (essentially a whole bunch of page scroll events) and transmit it all in one go to your JSON endpoint medium.com/_/batch. (this would have allowed me to automate testing sessions of different lengths). That, unfortunately, did not work.I originally believed that it was because the server was likely validating transmission time to stop someone from potentially creating partner program earnings for a writer for a period of time that they were not a member, say months in the future or past. But after some more experimentation (with requests sent at the correct timing and different payloads) I believe that the most probable explanation of why this didn’t work is that the eventID in the JSON payload is some sort of hash containing the UserID and the date of the page view as there does appear to be a pattern in EventIDs as the first 4 letters of the ID appear to be the same for requests from the same UserID and day. Due to code obfuscation, I was unable to figure out exactly how these userIDs are generated.Discovering the vulnerabilityIt was at this very same time I realized that nothing unique to the user was being transmitted to medium.com/_/batch other than the userID that was a part of every json object in the request payload (as demonstrated in the photo above). Modifying the userID by itself did not allow me to generate partner program earnings. (Keep in mind that no matter what you request from the endpoint it will always respond with ”success”: true.) So I was taking stabs at the dark with trial and error attempting to figure out how the endpoint was authenticating these requests. I belive that it was because I did not know how to compute valid EventIds (this is only something I believe needs to be done, I have no idea if these Ids represent anything beyond a random string of letters and numbers). I originally tried to use a find and replace on the website’s main HTML file to replace my current userID with that of another paid account I owned then trying to call the JS functions that are called when the window is initialized. That unfortunately didn’t get me anywhere as the code obfuscation on medium.com is too aggressive for me to understand what was going on. My next plan was to launch a Man in the Middle attack against myself using something like MITMProxy the Python library that would allow me to find and replace my userID with one of the people I wanted to impersonate while the data was in transit before it ever reached my web browser.Lucky breakI decided to try changing the requesting UID cookie value for the request to the main HTML page of an article. To my absolute amazement medium.com embedded the uid cookie value into the webpage as JSON data before validating that the session cookie and UID cookie represent a valid logged in session. Although the webpage does correctly identify my uid/session cookie as being invalid; it will still embed the UID data from the request cookie into the webpage. In the response, it sends back the “set-cookie” headers with information of a new session UID starting with “lo_”. Because of this, whatever UID cookie value the main web page request is made with, all batch requests (your api endpoint) will use that value as the “UserId”. Here’s an example where I’ve changed the userID to “Hello World”This is the request payload for the /_/batch endpoint, ive expanded 2 of the array items at randomI also found out that it is incredibly easy to find out peoples userIDs all you have to do is navigate to their profile and search for “{\”id\”:” in the HTML code of the webpage to find out their userID and you will see that the Netflix Tech BlogUserID is :”c3aeaf49d8a4”(on a side note, these userIDs are meant to be public)So now if you change your UID cookie to one of a paying user, then load up an article you have written on medium, Medium will transmit data to its /_/batch endpoint using someone else’s userID. At this point, if you were to read the article, it would generate revenue for the writer. Medium in no way validates the userID values and just assumes them to be correct.Heres the article if you want to check it outI was able to generate 34 cents by impersonating about 10 people in a single day. I obviously did not want to go overboard testing the concept as I did not want Medium thinking I had ill intent. I reported the bug through their bug bounty program first before writing any of this up.ConclusionTo conclude, I discovered that the member reading time appears to have no relationship to partner program earnings.(refer to above photo)We learnt that medium.com will embed any userID cookie value you transmit to them into their webpage (this is something they haven’t yet fixed).We learnt that the medium partner program endpoint does not verify that the user has a valid logged in session but instead just blindly accepts UserIDs and assumes they are correct.Moreover we have no idea if I’m the first person to have ever discovered this vulnerability, Medium partner program writers could have been cheated out of an unknown amount of money as they could have been sharing their revenue with people who had exploited this vulnerability.Hire MeFeel free to reach out to me by email: Mohammad-Ali@Bandzar.comInfoSec Write-upsA collection of write-ups from the best hackers in the…Follow33 Sign up for Infosec WriteupsBy InfoSec Write-upsNewsletter from Infosec Writeups Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

All The JavaScript You Need To Know Before Learning React,https://levelup.gitconnected.com/all-the-javascript-you-need-to-know-before-learning-react-85b091399c1?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"JavaScript,Programming,Web Development,React,Software Development","Photo by Joshua Aragon on UnsplashWe all have been in this stage. You have just finished an online course or other self-taught resources and have some grip over JavaScript and now the obvious choice is to learn some JavaScript framework. But approaching your first js framework can get really scary. But I beg you to not stop there, we all once had that doubt that we are not ready yet, it is something every developer goes through.In this post, I will make your transition to the React framework a lot easier. As I have listed down the most used JavaScript concepts used inside React Js.Before going into React Js you need to first make sure that you have learned the basics of JavaScript. But even after that, there are chances you might not have gone through concepts that React Js require, so please read this post till the end, even if you find it too easy or boring, at least skim over it.“If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough.”— Albert EinsteinCoding is a continuous journey, you learn on the way. You need to make one thing clear, no one in this world is completely ready to do something. You just have to do those things.I always did something I was a little not ready to do. I think that is how you grow.Let's get going!What we will be coveringEs6 classesArray functions (especially filter and map) you will use them a lot!Arrow functionslet and constImports and ExportsSpread and Rest OperatorThe ‘this’ conceptUsing Let and Const variablesBefore var was used to set new variables but with the ES6 updates let let and const were introduced.But what is the difference between var and let and const ?Scopevar variables are globally scoped or accessible. This means when they are declared outside a function they are accessible throughout your file or window. This can be dangerous because you can change it without knowing, hence getting a lot of errors.While on the other hand let and const has blocked scope. This means when they are declared inside a function or any block of code, they can’t be accessed outside it. Thus you can’t easily break your code by manipulating or redeclaring the same variable outside the function.Re-assigningVar variables can be re-assigned and updated easily, let can be updated but not re-assigned, and const can neither be re-assigned nor updated, it is constant(doesn’t change).Arrow functionsWhen I started learning about arrow functions, it was a bit tough to get holdover arrow functions, It took me some time to get used to it.Arrow functions are short and straight to the point. They are almost the same as regular functions but with less syntax.Note: Arrow functions are used a lot in modern frameworks, it is a must to learn.ES6 ClassesA class is another type of function which is declared by the class keyword and can be used to create new objects. A class contains properties and methods.The constructor method is used for initializing objects that are created by the class itself and we use this keyword to refer to the current class. For eg in StudentName class this refers to StudentClass.One of the most things used in Classes is InheritanceWe use extends in classes to inherit properties from another class.In the example below, the class TopStudents inherits the property and method from the StudentName class. The super method is used to call the parent constructor. In our case, it will call the constructor of the TopStudent class.Imports and exportsYou can store functions in one Javascript file and later on export it to use it in another Js file by importing the file or a specific function. It comes very handy to organize your code structure.How to export a file or some functions?You can use the default when exporting one main thing from the file.How import filesSpread and rest operatorWhen I first heard of this operator I was so curious to understand how only three dots can be so powerful, simple yet easy to use. To me, the three dots were like magic, a safe way to copy reference types without any issues.The spread and rest operator uses three dots (. . .) to initialize it.The spread operator is used for splitting up the values of an array and adding them to another array. Just as it says spread operator spreads values of one array into another array.The same can be used for objects also.The rest operatorThis operator is used to represent an infinite amount of arguments in a function.Contrary we need to specify how many arguments we will provide to a function but what if we don't know how many arguments we will need. Here come the rest operator, you can specify infinity amount of arguments.Array functionArray functions are not new but they are still important to know and practice on. In react, map and filter methods are extensively used when dealing with data.Filter methodThe filter method creates a new array of elements that returned true from the call back function passed and filters out the rest.In the example above it returns the objects with people who are 23 years and above only.Map methodThe map method creates a new array from the results of the callback function. The callback is called on each index on the array. The indexes are the elements in the array. Let’s look at an example.thisThis is one of the scariest and troublesome things you face when learning JavaScript. It is confusing and absurd at first, but learning it will be worth all the effort. You might not get it at the first attempt but no worries, this happens to almost everyone.The JavaScript this keyword refers to the object it belongs to.here this refers to the object person.ConclusionTo make your transition to react learn JavaScript first, don’t rush the course or documentation. Take your time be it weeks or months to ensure you understand vanilla JavaScript. I repeat don't rush. Not knowing some concept will make your React journey miserable.I have listed the concepts you will need to get started with your React journey, but keep in mind this is not everything.Thanks for reading, I hope you liked this article.Level Up CodingCoding tutorials and news.Follow153 JavaScriptProgrammingWeb DevelopmentReactSoftware Development153 claps153 clapsWritten byAli HaiderFollowWorking at 👉 theredsoft.com || Over 5 years of obsession with technology || Writer and developer.

TypeScript — Excess Property Checks,https://levelup.gitconnected.com/typescript-excess-property-checks-6ffe5584f450?source=tag_archive---------4-----------------------,"Typescript,Tutorial,JavaScript,Web Development","One of the core principals of TypeScript is that it is a Structural Type System.Simply put, TypeScript is fine with having extra properties as long as you provide a type with its’ required properties, let’s look at an example:But when we try to assign the object literal directly:And we get the following (and a little surprising) error:Type ‘{ x: number; y: number; meaningOfLife: number; }’ is not assignable to type ‘Point’.Object literal may only specify known properties, and ‘meaningOfLife’ does not exist in type ‘Point’.When TypeScript encounters object literal in assignments or when passed as an argument to functions it triggers an action called excess property checking.In contrary to structural typing, it check whether the object has the exact properties. As mentioned, the same is with object literals passed as an argument to functions:One interesting behavior is with “Weak Types” — types which all their fields are marked as Optional. In this case the excess property checking action takes place even when assigning intermediate variable:WorkaroundsWe can, although not recommended, workaround the excess property checking.The first way to do so is to use intermediate variable, this works since you first assign the object literal to an un-typed variable, and then the second assignment does not undergoes the excess property checking:The second way is to use type assertions:Level Up CodingCoding tutorials and news.Follow66 TypescriptTutorialJavaScriptWeb Development66 claps66 clapsWritten byTal OhanaFollowFullstack Softare Developer / Israel @ talohana.comFollowLevel Up CodingFollowCoding tutorials and news.

Flutter Web and Navigation History,https://medium.com/codechai/flutter-web-and-navigation-history-3feec04bfc80?source=tag_archive---------5-----------------------,"Dart,Flutter,Programming,Web Development,Software Development","Flutter Web and Navigation HistoryHow to know the navigation history in Flutter Web? Hmm…All in one Flutter resource: https://flatteredwithflutter.com/flutter-web-and-navigation-history/Flutter Web and Navigation HistoryBegin…View the demo hereWebsite: https://web.flatteredwithflutter.com/#/We will cover briefly aboutStoring navigation routesImplement navigatorObserversFlutter Web and Navigation History1. Storing navigation routesIt's quite clear, we need a data structure for storing routes.Thought process: When we navigate between different links in a browser, the last link is usually the first to be traced back (on click of the back button).Flutter Web and Navigation HistoryGoing 1 link to severalYou navigate to link AAfter a while, you go to link BFinally, you end up at the link C(Note: This assumes you are in 1 single tab only)On backtrackingFlutter Web and Navigation HistoryGoing back nowYou start backtrack from link CYou go to link BFinally, you end up at the link A(Note: This assumes you are in 1 single tab only)The data structure right for use would be Stack since we need to push the routes onto the stack and pop (when we go back to the previous link).Stack — Push, pop, topImplementing Stacks in DartIn doing my research I founddart:collectionAs per the documentation:Classes and utilities that supplement the collection support in dart:core.But did not find any explicit collection named Stack, until I stumbled upon ListQueueList based Queue.Keeps a cyclic buffer of elements, and grows to a larger buffer when it fills up. This guarantees constant time peek and remove operations, and amortized constant time add operations.The structure is efficient for any queue or stack usage.We will use ListQueue for storing our routes.Implementing ListQueue for storing routesWe make an abstract class first, to define the operations which we will implement for our generic ListQueue.abstract class _NavStack<T> {  void push(T val) {}  void pop() {}  T top();  List<T> fetchAll();  void get clear {}}push: For pushing a route of type Tpop: For popping the route (topmost)top: Get the route which is on topfetchAll: Get all the routes saved.clear: Clear the saved routesLet’s define our class(NavStack) which implements the above abstract class(_NavStack).class NavStack<T> implements _NavStack<T> {}Initialize the list queue byfinal ListQueue<T> _internal = ListQueue();Pushing itemPushing items in this list by using the addLast function of the list queue._internal.addLast('SOME VALUE');addLast: Adds the items at the end. Since each new route will be the latest, we add it to the end of the list queue.Popping itemPop the item in this list by using removeLast function of the list queue._internal.removeLast();removeLast: Removes and returns the last element of the queue.Top itemGetting the topmost or latest item in this list queue by the last function_internal.last;last: Returns the last (or topmost) element. Meaning our latest route is always at the top of the stack.Clearing and Fetching itemsWe will use the clear function of the list queue for clearing our stored routes.For fetching items, we will loop through the length of the list, add items to a new list and return.List<T> fetchAll() {  final _list = <T>[];    for (var i = 0; i < length; i++) {    _list.add(_internal.elementAt(i));  }  return _list;}2. Implement Navigator ObserversFlutter Web and Navigation History (Output)We have the list queue implemented from the above step.Next, we need to place this list queue in our flutter web, in such a way thatwhenever a new route is pushed,it should also be added to our NavStack classThere is a property inside MaterialApp called navigatorObservers. This implements RouteObserver internally.RouteObserverRouteObserver informs subscribers whenever a route of type R is pushed on top of their own route of type R or popped from it.e.g. a RouteObserver<PageRoute> will inform subscribed RouteAwareswhenever the user navigates away from the current page route to another page route.Methods inside RouteObserver classdidPop (whenever a route is popped)didPush (whenever a route is pushed)We will create our own navigator observers whichextends the RouteObserverimplements the didPop and didPush methodsFlutter Web and Navigation HistoryInside the didPushwe extract the current screen name and push it into our NavStack class. This way whenever a route is pushed, it also gets added to our class.Finally, we add this custom navigator observer to MaterialApp’s property.return MaterialApp(  // OTHER PROPERTIES  navigatorObservers: [CustomRouteObserver()],);Interesting Articles related to Flutter Web here:Flutter Web and Machine LearningUsing machine learning in flutter web?

Using Two-Pointer Technique to Optimize Algorithm Solutions,https://levelup.gitconnected.com/using-two-pointer-technique-to-optimize-algorithm-solutions-49271becb34d?source=tag_archive---------6-----------------------,"Algorithms,Programming,Coding,Web Development,Software Development","Photo by Max Duzij on UnsplashWhen dealing with strings and arrays in the context of algorithm challenges, our first instinct usually revolves around built-in methods.Let’s take a look at this seemingly easy problem:/* Description:Given a sorted (ascending) array of integers, write a function that returns a sorted (ascending) array which contains the square of each number.*/// Examples:square([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])// => [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25])square([-7, -3, 2, 3, 11])// => [4, 9, 9, 49, 121]Like many others, my immediate reaction was to make use of sort() method after mapping out (map()) the squared version of each integer, like so:function square(arr) {  arr = arr.map(num => num * num)  return arr.sort((a, b) => a - b)}While my solution above achieves the desired result, its somewhat brute-force approach leads to a not-so-performant O(n log(n)) time complexity.So how can we improve the runtime complexity?This is where a popular and effective strategy, Two-Pointer Technique, comes into play.When iterating over an array or string, we can set two pointers to search and/or compare two elements. There are three common ways to set the pointers:Start both pointers at the beginning of the iterationStart both pointers at the end of the iterationStart one pointer at the beginning, the other at the end, both moving toward each other and meeting in the middle.Here’s how it works in our square() example:Step 0:Initiate an empty array that will store our results.Step 1:Create two pointers, i and j, where i keeps track of the negative integers, while j keeps track of the positives.Step 2:Iterate over the array. Keep moving j forward until the element of the array (arr[j]) is a positive integer.Step 3:Inside the iteration, compare the squared elements between index i and index j, push/append the smaller element to the resulting array.Step 4:After the iteration in Step 3, our resulting array will have a sorted set of integers. What remains is the element(s) at index i and index j.We can subsequently push/append the remaining elements(s) to the resulting array.Step 5:Return the resulting array.Here’s the two-pointer technique approach (courtesy of Women Who Code San Diego):function squareTwoPointer(arr) {  let result = []  // create 2 pointers: i keeps track of negatives, j keeps track of positives  let j = 0  let i;  while (j < arr.length && arr[j] < 0) {    j++    i = j - 1  }  while (j < arr.length && i >= 0) {    if ((arr[i] * arr[i]) < (arr[j] * arr[j])) {      result.push((arr[i] * arr[i]))      i--    } else {      result.push((arr[j] * arr[j]))      j++    }  }  while (i >= 0) {    result.push((arr[i] * arr[i]))    i--  }  while (j < arr.length) {    result.push((arr[j] * arr[j]))    j++  }  return result}The time complexity of this optimized solution is O(n) because we only perform one iteration at a time and sort the elements in place.As with almost all algorithm challenges, there are multiple ways to approach this problem. The two-pointer strategy appears to be a good starting point for optimization.If you haven’t applied two-pointer techniques in your problem-solving process, I hope this example boosts your confidence in coming up with more performant algorithm solutions.Onward and upward!Level Up CodingCoding tutorials and news.Follow118 AlgorithmsProgrammingCodingWeb DevelopmentSoftware Development118 claps118 clapsWritten byAnnie LiaoFollowFullstack Developer: React with Rails.

The Complete Developers Guide to GitHub,https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/the-complete-developers-guide-to-github-31060f667002?source=tag_archive---------7-----------------------,"Web Development,Tech,Programming,Startup,Software Development","Gif (Source and Credits : WiffleGifs)Are you a newbie developer? Have you recently started using GitHub? This article is for all the newbie developers who want to get started with GitHub and experienced developers who still find GitHub complex and confusing.What is GitHub?GitHub is a social code-hosting platform used for version control. For example, assume you and a bunch of your friends are building a new website and everyone wants to update their codes simultaneously while working on the project. In this case, GitHub helps them to build a centralized repository where everyone can upload, edit, and manage the code files.You can find GitHub here: https://github.com/Advantages of GitHub :GitHub is a very versatile and collaborative tool to use. It is ideal for working on projects of any size and makes it easy to contribute to your favorite open source projects.GitHub provides developers and researchers with a dynamic and collaborative environment, that supports peer review, commenting, and discussion. It’s an amazing tool for web workflows.It’s an ideal platform for creating a backup of your work instead of saving the code on a desktop or any server.GitHub on your resume can make your profile look better than others who don’t have any experience working with GitHub.GitHub’s help section and guides have articles for almost all the topics you can think of. It has excellent documentation which is very helpful for the developers.No coding required!Go to https://github.com/ and create an account.Introduction to GitHubOnce the account has been created successfully, you can do the following —Create and use a repositoryStart and manage a new branchCommit Changes — Make changes to a file and push them to GitHubOpen and merge a pull requestStep 1: Create a repositoryWith a repository, you can —Organize a single project.Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets, etcTo create a repository —As shown in the screenshot below, In the upper right corner, next to your avatar click + and then select New repository.Create a new repositoryName your repository test-repo.Create a repositoryFill the description part and select Initialize this repository with a README. You can also choose who can see and commit to your repository by choosing public and private options.2. Create a BranchBranching is a feature available in most modern version control systems.Branching (Image source and credits: Pinterest)Git branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes during the development phase. When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug, you create a new branch to encapsulate your changes. So this makes it harder for unstable or bad code to get merged into the main codebase, and it gives you the chance to clean up your code before merging it into the main branch.To create a branch —Go to your new repository test-repo.Click the drop-down at the top of the file list that says branch: master. Type a branch name i.e, in this case, I gave the name readme-edits-branch and select and hit the create branch: readme-edits-brach from “master” as shown in the screenshot below.Create a branchOnce done successfully, you can see 2 branches ( master and readme-edits-branch)as shown in the screenshot below —Successful branching3. Commit ChangesCommits are nothing but saved messages. Each commit has an associated commit message which is used to capture the history of your changes so that other contributors to the same project can understand what changes have been made and why.To make and commit changes —Click the README.md file. and click the pencil icon as shown in the screenshot below to edit the file.Commit ChangesWrite the changes and then in the bottom, as you can see commit changes, there you can write about yourself and info/description about the changes that have been made to the file.Commit Changes — Add comments/descriptionYou can also preview changes and then click commit button, as shown in the screenshot below —Commit ChangesOnce successfully done, these changes will be made to README file on your readme-edit-branch4. Pull RequestOpen a pull request —When you open a pull request, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. You can see the pull request tab next to the issues tab in the screenshot below. Click the green New pull request button.Create a new pull requestSelect the branch you made, readme-edit-branchto compare with master from the drop-down menu.Compare changesCompare the changes (changes highlighted in the green) —Compare ChangesOnce you are satisfied with the changes, click the Create pull request button. Once clicked, you will land to Pull request page —Create a pull requestHere you can write something about the pull request and on the right-hand side, as you can see, you can assign this pull request to anyone for a review or comment.Create a pull requestOnce you are done, click Create pull request.5. Merge your Pull RequestYou can merge your changes. In this article, we are going to merge readme-edits-branch into the master branch.Previously in Point 4 of this article, we opened a pull request. You can see (Pull request 1) in the below screenshot —Pull RequestIn order to Merge the Pull Request, Click on the green Merge pull request button and merge the changes to the master. Once confirmed, click Confirm Merge.Merge Pull RequestConfirm MergeOnce successfully merged, you can see the purple boxed Merged icon —Successfully MergedAfter a successful merge, you can delete the branch since its changes have been incorporated. Click Delete branch button —Delete the branchAfter successfully deleting the branch, you can see the message that readme-edits-branch has been deleted. Just in case, if the branch has been deleted by mistake, you can restore the branch by clicking Restore Branch button.6. Clone and Fork GitHub RepositoryIf you want to use the code which is present in the public repository then using you can directly copy the contents by cloning/downloading.Fork and Clone illustration (Image Source and Credits: ToolsQA)To Clone —Just go to the required repository and click the green-colored Clone or Download Button.CloneForking is nothing but creating a copy of a repository. It allows you to freely experiment with changes, offer suggestions without affecting the original project, and is used to either propose suggestions or changes to someone else’s project or to use someone else’s project to build your project or use it as a starting point.To Fork —Go to the repository you want to fork, for example in this article, I’m forking Jupyter repository using the fork button on the right side as shown below in the screenshot —ForkYou will get below message screen while forking —Forking in progressOnce the forking is done successfully, go back to your account and you can see a text “forked from jupyter/notebook” —Successfully forkedSource: All the screenshots are from my own GitHub account.Credits to:Build software better, togetherGitHub brings together the world’s largest community of developers to discover, share, and build better software.

Async Validation in Angular | Step By Step Guide with PHP and MySQL,https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/async-validation-in-angular-step-by-step-guide-with-php-and-mysql-ebb551ef4b8f?source=tag_archive---------8-----------------------,"Angular,Programming,JavaScript,Web Development,Angular Material","Validation performs a very important role in application development. Validation helps the user to access/use the application in a better way. Most of the UI frameworks offer built-in validation. We can use some third party plugins for validation also.Say, for example, if a user wants to verify his/her mobile number using OTP, then he/she must enter a mobile number in the given input field. Sometimes the user may enter more than ten(10) digits( Indian mobile numbers are ten(10) digit length). After entering the wrong mobile number(more digits), the user expects OTP. However, the SMS server will tell us the number is not valid. This consumes a lot of time and the user will not be happy. However, if we show this error while typing the number itself, instead of sending this to the server, it will reduce time. It will be the best practice and gives the user better user experience.So using the proper validation for needed input fields will help the end-user while using the application. And it reduces application complexity.Types of validation.Client-Side ValidationServer-Side ValidationAsync ValidationIn this tutorial, you will learn how to do Async Validation using the Angular framework.What is Async Validation and Examples?Instead of explaining the theory of what is Async validation, we can take realtime use cases where Async validation is needed.Case 1:Let’s take a simple example. Assume you are creating a Gmail like application. In that application, the username is always unique. When we try to register, it will ask us to enter the username. When we enter the username in the input field, it will send the username to the server, And it will check whether the username exists or not. If the username exists, then it will show the error message to us. This is called as async validation.Case 2:Assume you are creating the e-commerce/ERP application. It is related to products. Now you want to put every product under a category. Then we will create a list of categories. The category is a unique value. So we have check whether the category exists or not. This is also called as async validation.Like there are many use cases available. In simple terms, if you want to create unique values on your database, then you must need the Async Validation.The list of things, we are going to see in the tutorial is listed below.Create REST API using PHP and MySQLCreate Services in Angular to Call REST APICreate Custom Async Validator using AngularCreate FormGroup and Bind the Async Validation to FormControlShow Validation Message1. Create REST API using PHP and MySQLYou can use any REST API. Here I am using the PHP and MySQL for REST API creation. Feel free to skip this section, if you have REST API already or you know how to create API also.Scenario:For this example, we are going to create the user’s list. In the user’s list, the username is unique. So we are going to validate whether the username exists or not using Angular with PHP and MySQL.I assume you already have PHP and MySQL is installed on your machine. I am using a macOS. So the mac always requires the local IP address(127.0.0.1) instead of the localhost. If you are using Windows, then you can use the localhost instead of the IP address in the following examples.Step1:Create a user’s table in MySQL using the below query.Execute the above code on your MySQL database.Step2:To create a REST API in PHP, I am using some different folder structures for best practice.Create a folder named async under your XAMPP htdocs folder. The async is the root folder for this example.Create a config folder under the async folder. Create a dbconn.php file under the config folder and paste the below code in the file.Change the username, password, and database name in the above code.Create a dao folder under the async folder. Then create a validation-dao.php file under the dao folder and paste the below code.Here we have a check username function, which takes the username as input and will check whether the username exists on the database or not. If the username exists it will return true or it will return false.Create a validate folder under the async folder. Then Create a check-username.php file under the validate folder and paste the below code.The above code catches the username from the Angular Application and passes the username to the dao file to check against the database.Here I am using some standard folder structure. You can put all the three files under one folder if you feel this structure is too complex.Here is the final REST API URLhttp://localhost/async/validate/check-username.php?username=rajaExecute the above URL on your machine. It will return false as the output. Why because there is no username. You can change the username in the above URL, if the username exists, then it will return true as the output.I have the GET method to catch data. You can use the POST method also in the REST API.2. Create Services in Angular to Call REST APIThe REST API is ready. Now create a new Angular project using the below command, if you have not created it.ng new async-exampleNow open the project using VS Code editor. Now we need to Angular Material. Angular Material is a UI framework. It is optional only. However, it will give us a good look and feel. So use Angular Material.Install Angular Material using the below command on your Angular project.ng add @angular/materialI am using some standard folder structure for Angular. You can skip this folder structure if you want. However, it will be very useful when you develop complex applications.Create an IP services file in Angular usingng g s services/ipAnd paste the below code in the ip.services.ts file.This is the only place, where you can easily change the pointing server. This approach is very helpful if you want to switch to a different server.Create unique services file usingng g s services/uniqueIn the unique.services.ts file, paste the below code.It will pass the user typed input values to the REST API URL and return the output.3. Create Custom Async Validator using AngularNow we need to create a custom async validator. And the validator will call the unique service to pass the input values. And this validator will give the validation status to the input field.Create a validation folder under src/app.Create an asyncValidator.ts file under the src/app/validation folder and paste the below code.This code uses the delay concept. It means it won’t send every input value to the server. Instead, it will send the user typed values every 1 second. You can change the timer value as per your need.The shouldBeUnique is the error property. You need to catch this property on HTML and will show the message based on the condition. You can change this name. But follow the variable naming rules to create a property name like this.4. Create FormGroup and Bind the Async Validation to FormControlEverything is ready. Now we need to create a FormGroup with username as FormControl.Create a constructor with UniqueService as a variable.Open the app.component.ts file and bind the Async Validator to the username like below.5. Show Validation MessageNow we need to bind this on the component page. Create a form and bind the username with formControlName property.By default, the formControl will show an error styled input field if the username exists. However, if you want to show the proper error message, then you have to use the mat-error tag. And check the shouldBeUnique property is valid or not.That’s all. It will show error message like below when the username exists.Hope you enjoy this article!.Thanks for reading this article!.Source Code Link.bharathirajatut/angular-examplesAngular example source codes.

Understanding Recursion by implementing the ‘Tower of Hanoi’ game in JavaScript,https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/understanding-recursion-by-implementing-the-tower-of-hanoi-in-javascript-a83a54a62f40?source=tag_archive---------9-----------------------,"JavaScript,Javascript Tips,Recursion,Web Development,Technology","Photo by Jen Theodore on UnsplashRecursion is a problem-solving technique, where the solution of a larger problem is defined in terms of smaller instances of itself. You can try to imagine an example in the real world when you’re digging through your home and come across a mysteriously locked suitcase, the key for the suitcase is probably in this other box. This box contains more boxes, with more boxes inside those boxes. The key is in a box somewhere.How to search for the key?There are two popular approaches for us to solve this problem.The first approachIn this solution, we use a while-loop algorithm: “while the pile isn’t empty, grab a box, and look through it.”while the pile isn’t empty, grab a box, and look through itThe second approachIn this approach, we use recursion algorithm: “where a function calls itself.”where a function calls itselfBoth solutions accomplish the same result but the second approach seems easier than the first one? Yes, it is clearer to me 😁. But in fact, there are no performance benefits to using recursion algorithms 🤣.Loops may achieve a performance gain for your program. Recursion may achieve a performance gain for your programmer. Choose which is more important in your situation! — Leigh Caldwell¹.Here’s the second method in JavaScript.Because a recursion calls itself, you have to tell it when to stop everything. In this case, this is when we found the key.Tower of HanoiThe gameThis is a popular mathematical game in over the world. There are 3 pegs, Source, Destination, and Extra marked as S, D, and E respectively, and there are n discs, each of different sizes, which can be inserted into any of these three pegs. All discs are initially inserted into Source peg in decreasing order (smallest at the top) as follows.The initial stateOur mission is to move all the discs from Source peg (S) to Destination peg (D).The final stateThere are 2 restrictions.Only one disc can be moved at a time.At any point in the process, we should never place a larger disc on top of a smaller disc.How to solve it?This may appear to be a complex problem to solve otherwise, but if we think recursively, then the problem can be solved in three simple steps.Step-1: move n-1 discs from S to E using D.Step-2: move the n-th disc from S to DStep-3: move n-1 discs from E to D using SWe will write a function in JavScript that accepts characters representing three rods (S, D & E) and the number of discs (n), and print the movement of discs between pegs such that all discs are moved from the initial state (inside S) to the final state (inside D).If we run the function for 3 discs: resolver_tower_of_hanoi(‘s’, ‘d’, ‘e’, 3), the output is.Move Disk-1 FROM s TO dMove Disk-2 FROM s TO eMove Disk-1 FROM d TO eMove Disk-3 FROM s TO dMove Disk-1 FROM e TO sMove Disk-2 FROM e TO dMove Disk-1 FROM s TO dEasy, right?References[1] http://stackoverflow.com/a/72694/139117JavaScript In Plain EnglishNew JavaScript + Web Development articles every day.Follow147 JavaScriptJavascript TipsRecursionWeb DevelopmentTechnology147 claps147 clapsWritten byTrung Anh DangFollowI write about things that I like and things that I don’t, mainly in the business, art and tech sphere.

How To Build a Vue.js Static website with AWS S3,https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/how-to-build-a-vue-js-static-website-with-aws-s3-caab0fa54119?source=tag_archive---------10-----------------------,"AWS,JavaScript,Vuejs,Programming,Web Development","Photo by Alex Cheung on UnsplashThere are a number of ways you can build a website with Vue such as Java with Vue, NodeJS with Vue, NGINX serving Vue, etc. For the single-page applications, all you need to do is to load the initial index.html. Once you load the index.html the Vue library kicks in and do the rest of the job like loading component, calling API calls, etc. What if there are no backend calls and you want to build a static website with Vue?AWS S3 is one of the options which provides a low cost and highly reliable static website hosting solution. These static sites have only CCS, HTML, JS files, fonts, etc. In this post, we can see how we can build a static website with Vue and host that with the AWS S3.Example ProjectEnough AWS S3 for this projectImplementationSummaryConclusionExample ProjectHere is an example project which we can put in the AWS S3 for static website hosting. This is a simple profile page with a header and some sections.// clone the projectgit clone https://github.com/bbachi/my-profile-vuejs.git// install dependencies and start the projectnpm installnpm run serveYou can clone the project and run it on your machine. Here is the demonstration when you run it on your localhost and the port 8080.Example ProjectEnough AWS S3 for this projectS3 is a storage solution from the AWS. There are some basic concepts that you need to know before working with AWS S3. There are so many things that you can do with S3 such as Bulk storage, management of objects with lifecycles, Object versioning, static website hosting, etc. We have Buckets, Objects, and folders.Buckets: Buckets are the main storage container of S3 and it can group folders and files under one name. The bucket name should be unique across all of AWS accounts. You can only create 100 buckets per account and you can store unlimited files or data under each bucket. Once you create the bucket under one account and it can’t be transferred to another account. When we create a bucket you can choose which region we are storing objects to optimize latency.Objects: Objects are static files and metadata information. User uploads files and metadata is applied to those files such as storage type, etc. All objects are private and can store from 0B to 5TB of data. You can enable versioning, can assign storage type, and change it later as well. Each object can be publicly available via URL. You can encrypt these objects as well.Folders: Amazon S3 has a flat structure and there is no hierarchy file structure that you would typically see. Folders are only used to group objects.You can find more information on the AWS documentation here.ImplementationLet’s build our local project and upload those static files into the bucket.Build the local projectLet’s build the project with this command npm run buildand the resulting built is placed under /dist/. In this case, it is /dist. All the ccs and js files are placed in CSS and js folders respectively.Let’s build the Vue project with the relative path of the bucket name. For example, we have a bucket name called staticvuejsweb so we have to build the Vue UI with this relative path.This is because all the files uploaded to the cloud storage can be accessed with the bucket name prefix. All the js files, CSS files that are accessed in the index.html should have this relative path.We need to add the following entry in the file called vue.config.jsvue.config.jsnpm run buildUpload files into the bucketLet’s create a bucket called bachivuejsmyprofile(you can name any) and upload all these files under /dist folder.AWS S3 BucketOnce you upload all the files, we need to enable static website hosting under properties. Make sure you have index.html as an index document.Enabling static website hostingNotice that the index.html has all the compiled javascript files from the compiler and you can see <div id=""root""></div>in the body. This index.html pulls all the required files for the app to work properly in the browser.index.htmlThis is an actual App.vue file where you can find the id.App.vueOne more thing we need to do is enable public access under the permissions tab. You can do this while uploading files as well.Public AccessSite WorkingError PageIf you enter any other URL other than above you will get 403 Forbidden. For example, Let’s access this URL http://bachivuejsmyprofile.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ someurl you would get the below page.Error PageWe can configure an error page instead of a default error page from AWS. We should define error.html under a static website hosting for an error document.error.htmlHere is an error.html file and should be uploaded as well.error.html uploaded to the bucketIf you access the URL again http://bachivuejsmyprofile.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/domsdsdd you would get our customized error page.Error PageSummaryThere are a number of ways you can build a website with Vue such as Java with Vue, NodeJS with Vue, NGINX serving Vue, etc.Amazon S3 is one of the options for static website hosting.There are Buckets, Objects, and folders in the S3.You can only create 100 buckets per account and you can store unlimited files or data under each bucket.You need to build the Vue app and upload all the files into the bucket.Make them publicly accessible.You need to define an index document for an index page.We can configure an error page for the static website.ConclusionAWS S3 is one of the options for static website hosting and we can even plugin API gateway and AWS lambda to get any API data or dynamic data.

Simple Vuex Modules Starter With Real Data,https://medium.com/swlh/simple-vuex-modules-starter-with-real-data-c738d11ea2a0?source=tag_archive---------11-----------------------,"Vuejs,Vuex,JavaScript,Web Development","Vue / Vuex project setupWe will use Vue CLI.Start by installing the CLI globally on your machine.Open your terminal and run:npm install -g @vue/cliWhen it’s done, select your root project space and create your project:Terminalvue create my-projectThe CLI will ask you to pick a preset of your choice and here, just make sure that Vuex is selected.On macOS, navigate with your keyboard “up” and “down” arrows and select with the spacebar.TerminalAfter a short moment, your project is created. Then run:cd my-projectnpm run serveYour project tree should look like this:Project treeFinally, remove the CLI dummy content until you see a blank page.Vuex store setupNow let’s focus on the store!As a reminder, your store is registered globally inside main.js.main.jsWe would like to divide our store into modules as it’s very helpful, if not essential, for scalability and maintainability when you deal with large-scale projects.Inside the store folder create an index.js file and initialize your store:./store/index.jsThen, always inside the store folder, create two javascript files as our modules and we will name them respectively posts.js and albums.js../storeInside each one of them set the store module object:posts.js and albums.jsBack to index.js, import your two modules posts.js & albums.js, and hook them inside the modules object:./store/index.jsWhat will happen here is that each time you call, for example, a getter or an action, Vuex will look inside the modules object to get you what you need, but we will explain it better with our example below.API callsWithin the ./src folder create a new folder and name it services.Inside the services folder, create a javascript file. We will call it api.js.api.js created inside ./src/servicesWe will use real data pulled from a real REST API using JSONPlaceholder.JSONPlaceholder is a free online REST API provider for testing and prototyping.We will make the requests using Axios.On your Terminal and at the project root install Axios:npm i axiosInside api.js, import Axios and make your calls../services/api.jsStore modules setupWhat we want to achieve is:posts.js module with its action will fetch the API: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/postsalbums.js module with its action will fetch the API: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albumsWe will start with posts.js module by following the steps in the comments like below:./store/posts.jsInside the second module, albums.js is exactly the same as above but with the second API call../store/albums.jsTime to enjoy the data :)Consume the data inside a view of your choice.Note that we are using mapGetters and mapActions to connect Vuex to our template../views/Home.vueOn your browser you should see the following:Your browserHow “mapGetters” and “mapActions” work under the hood.Remember above how we structured our store modules:./store/index.jsand how we hooked mapGetters and mapActions to our template:Getters — ./views/Home.vueActions — ./views/Home.vueThe Vuex mapping behaves like the following:Under the hood :)Basically, each one of your mapGetters and mapActions will take as a first argument the name of the module that you set initially inside your store as a String and as a second argument the Array of the corresponding getters and actions as Strings as well.Now, you can divide your store into modules of your choice. You can have one for authentication, one for user details, or another one for some app states like a dark mode for example.Thank you for reading!The StartupMedium's largest active publication, followed by +723K people.

"<strong class=""bt"">Bê</strong>",https://medium.com/@belmirofss/b%C3%AA-%C3%A1-b%C3%A1-do-angular-8f23a109b4fc?source=tag_archive---------12-----------------------,"Angular,Angular2,Web Development,Framework,JavaScript","O objetivoNosso objetivo é bem claro e simples: levantar as palavras mais populares ao trabalhar com Angular, dar uma simples introdução ao que ela se trata, mapear links e te instigar/despertar para avançar ainda mais aos seus estudos e entender melhor o assunto.Dito isso, chega de lero lero e bora lá!AngularNada mais justo que começar com a palavra que representa o que estamos falando. O Angular é um framework desenvolvido e mantido por uma empresa, acho que pouco conhecida, chamada Google.Utilizamos o Angular para construir interfaces utilizando HTML, CSS e o TypeScript. Ele nos permite criarmos aplicações SPAs (Single Page Application) de altíssima qualidade e muita produtividade.Um ponto muito importante, pois muitas vezes há a confusão de que são tecnologias iguais, Mas não! Angular e AngularJS são diferentes, eles não são compatíveis e tem estruturas, linguagem e funcionalidades diferentes.Documentação completa do Angular.Angular University.Angular concepts.SPASPA, do inglês Single Page Application e do português Aplicação de Página Única, é uma aplicação que reescreve dinamicamente uma única página ao invés de carregar uma nova página. Essa abordagem evita a interrupção da experiência do usuário promovendo a sensação de um sistema desktop.Clique aqui para saber mais sobre SPAs.Angular CLIÉ a ferramenta de linha de comando para automatizar ações no desenvolvimento, ou seja, nada mais do que é um assistente para criação e gerenciamento da aplicação.Das funções mais básicas, temos:ng new: jeito mais fácil de criar uma aplicação funcional.ng generate: uma maneira simples e rápida de gerar componentes, rotas, serviços, módulos etc.ng serve: Um comando que roda a aplicação localmente com extrema facilidade.Vale forçar que existe outros comandos úteis. Os que foram apresentados são os mais básicos que devemos conhecer.Documentação completa do Angular CLI.ComponentesHá quem diga que os componentes são a parte mais fundamental de uma aplicação Angular de boa qualidade. A proposta da componentização é encapsular regras de interface e comportamentos de forma reutilizável.Se liga que abordagem mais simples. Os três componentes são um componente que abstraí uma barra de ferramentas, o formulário de cadastro e um outro para a tabela.Se liga que abordagem mais simples. Os três componentes são um componente que abstraí uma barra de ferramentas, o formulário de cadastro e um outro para a tabela.Então ressaltando, podemos muito bem criar componentes que supomos que não seria reutilizáveis e fazemos isso justamente para simplificar o código e encapsular funcionalidades.Clique aqui ler mais sobre componentes.Lifecycle hooksTodo componente tem um ciclo de vida, o qual é gerenciado pelo Angular. Com isso, o Angular nos oferece funções de cada etapa do ciclo de vida, para agirmos da forma que quisermos.Na imagem mostra todas as funções e na ordem do ciclo de vida. Nesse primeiro momento podemos entender os três principais:ngOnChanges: chamado quando é definido ou redefinido as propriedades de entrada.ngOnInit: invocado na inicialização do componente, após a definição das entradas.ngOnDestroy: chamado no encerramento do ciclo de vida.Clique aqui para conhecer mais sobre o Lifecycle hooks.ServiçosDe forma bem geral e simplificada, os serviços são criados para concentrar regras de negócio e consumir uma API.E através da injeção de dependências podemos injetá-los em nossos componentes (e até mesmo outros serviços) para que assim possamos utiliza-los.Clique aqui para saber mais sobre serviços.Clique aqui para saber mais sobre injeção de dependências.MódulosAjudam a gente a tornar nossa aplicação mais organizada sendo uma forma de “agrupamento” de componentes, serviços, outros módulos etc.Um módulo tem basicamente três propriedades mais utilizadas e importantes, são elas: imports, exports e declarations.Em imports é onde importamos outros módulos, exports é onde dizemos ao Angular o que exportar desse módulo para outros que o vier a importar e em declarations é o lugar que declaramos tudo que pertence aquele módulo.Clique aqui para saber mais sobre módulos.Lazy loadingSe você não quer que sua aplicação demore 15 segundos para startar, esse é um tema que você deve ficar ligado. Traduzido para carregamento preguiçoso ou carregamento por demanda, lazy loading é a arte de adiar a inicialização de alguma coisa até o ponto que ela se torna necessária.Tema esse que se relaciona com o acima (módulos), pois, por padrão, os módulos são carregados no start da aplicação, sendo eles necessários ou não.O procedimento mais básico para trabalhar com lazy loading é a modulazação da aplicação e o carregamento dela por rotas. Para realizarmos o carregamento preguiçoso utilizamos do loadChildren.Ou seja, no exemplo ao lado, o módulo de “items” apenas será carregado quando a rota “items” for acionada.Clique aqui para ler mais sobre Lazy Loading.InterpolaçãoPermite incorporamos variáveis entre tags do HTML e nas atribuições dos atributos das tags. Por padrão usamos chaves duplas ({{ }}) para delimitar.Exemplo perfeito que demonstra a interpolação de duas variáveis dentro da tag <h1>. O resultado seria “Pranaya Rout” entre a tag.Clique aqui para acessar a documentação da interpolação.Property bindÉ um mecanismo unidirecional que permite definir propriedades de um elemento na exibição. Envolve atualizar o valor de uma propriedade no componente e vincular no modelo exibição.De forma bem simplória, seria o componente pai definindo propriedades de um componente filho.No exemplo da imagem, vemos a definição de uma propriedade de entrada chamada childExample com a variável do componente pai chamada parentExample.Clique aqui para ler mais sobre Property Bind.Event bindingEsse tipo de ligação flui quando um evento é acionado. A camada de visualização envia dados de um evento para o componente.Novamente de forma bem simplória, seria, dessa vez, o componente filho disparando um evento ao componente pai.Já nesta figura, vemos a tag <button> disparando um evento denomicado click para o componente pai.Clique aqui para ler mais sobre Event Binding.DiretivasSão responsáveis por alterar a aparência ou o comportamento de um elemento no DOM.É possível tanto criar suas próprias diretivas como também já existem algumas bem importantes já criadas, como por exemplo a *ngIf (condição de exibição de um elemento no DOM) e a *ngFor (condição de repetição de um elemento no DOM) que são responsáveis por adicionar ou remover elementos no DOM. Também temos como NgStyle e NgClass que permitem alteramos a estilização do elemento — dando possibilidades de manipulação de propriedades de estilização e classes de um elemento.Clique aqui para ler mais sobre diretivas.PipesÉ um recurso que permite que possamos realizar transformações. Os pipes tem a função de receber algo e retornar um valor transformado.O próprio Angular já disponibiliza uma série de pipes já criados para nós, como transformação de moeda, transformação de data, uppercase, lowercase, decimal e percentual. No entanto, é claro, que você também pode seus próprios.Clique aqui para saber mais sobre pipes.Guardas de rotasSão serviços que implementam uma interface e diz ao Angular se uma rota deve ou não permitir a navegação, seja ela de entrada ou de saída. Um exemplo ótimo e clássico é permitir que o usuário acesse a rota /dashboard apenas caso ele esteja logado, caso contrário não será possível.Clique aqui para ler mais sobre guardas de rotas.Inputs e OutputsInputs e Outputs são decoradores que permite o Angular compartilhar informação no contexto pai e filho de componentes e diretivas.Na documentação do próprio Angular é dito para imaginarmos os Inputs e Outputs como portas ou portais. Os Inputs são as portas de entrada do componente, enquanto os Outputs são as portas saída. E é claro que, embora muitas vezes apareçam juntos, eles são independentes, podemos utilizar somente o Input ou utilizar somente o Output.Para entender mais sobre Inputs e Outputs, clique aqui.ObservablesAo trabalhar com Angular logo logo você se verá de frente com um Observable, e o que é isso? Isso que vamos ver agora.Em sua definição, um Observable é uma classe que nos permite trabalharmos de forma assíncrona. Para isso, ele emite notificações sempre que ocorre uma mudança e com isso podemos trilhar nosso caminho.Basicamente eles vem para substituir um pouco a utilização das Promises. Vale destacar que o Angular foi construído para desenvolvermos aplicações reativas e portanto ele adotou por padrão o uso do Observable. Suas vantagens acima das Promises são a emissão de notificações e as tratativas que são possíveis de realizar.Exemplos de aplicabilidades mais básicas de um Observable, que com certeza você utilizará, são: eventos observáveis de um componente filho para um componente pai, lidar com solicitações e respostas HTTP, escutar eventos de roteamento e escutar eventos de formulário.Clique aqui para ler mais sobre Observables.Clique aqui para visualizar algumas aplicabilidades de um Observable.SubscribeSubscribe, acredito eu, que podemos dizer que ele é o principal método de um Observable. De forma bem traduzida, o subscribe nada mais é do que o método que se inscreve em um Observable para escutar suas notificações.Acesse aqui uma resposta no Stack Overflow sobre o que é o subscribe.RxJSRxJS é uma biblioteca fantástica que permite fazermos muitas coisas relacionado a programação reativa. Essa biblioteca fornece para gente uma imensa variedade de métodos e classes que nos ajudam a trabalhar.Esse tema é tão grandioso que já vou deixar direto os links para te ajudar.Angular e RxJS.Documentação completa do RxJS.RxJs In 6 minutes!Rxjs Introdution.UI KitsGeralmente quando vamos desenvolver um aplicação Angular, nós utilizamos uma UI Kit — O que é isso? É uma biblioteca que já disponibiliza um kit de componentes, temas, layout etc. para facilitar nosso trabalho.Esse tópico está aqui justamente para te apresentar algumas.Angular Material.Angular Bootstrap.Nebular.PrimeNGOutros links :)Angular Style Guide.Angular Best Practises.Melhor curso de Angular da vida ❤Fim.Se você chegou até aqui fico super feliz e se isso te ajudou em algo, fico mais feliz ainda.

Music Live Streaming,https://medium.com/@skippybla/music-live-streaming-4153dfb007b9?source=tag_archive---------13-----------------------,"Live Streaming,Webcasting,Broadcast,Web Development,Case Study","This covers a system to live stream and video record all the concert events at the largest music college in the nation. 20 robotic cameras across 6 concert halls, automatically streaming on a custom-built web platform, built over the course of several years. Half is AV, and the other in web technology, but both are required to make it all work. My role in this covers camera to screen, from designing the audio and video systems, to writing code for the website and encoders. Being able to design the entire end-to-end workflow was a rewarding experience, knowing students and faculty can access video so easily and effortlessly, and I can walk away with a greater appreciation for just how many moving parts there are when someone is able to watch a concert online.The project is on-going, and I will update this as things change.You can watch live events at https://recording.music.unt.edu/liveWhat Makes UNT Different?Nothing. Is that surprising to hear? UNT has the same issues with digital, blunders and bureaucracy as any other large organization. You probably feel similar roadblocks are at your organization. The difference for me is that I took this on with a desire to make something better, and for a number of years had a supervisor willing to see those through. It was not a well-planned, well-thought-out, perfectly executed multi-year deployment. It simply took constant effort on getting over the bumps, red tape, and limitations, and often doing many, many things outside of the scope of the job (and salary). Sometimes it just takes strong willpower, the one right person to trust in you, gaining a few gray hairs, and a whole lot of overtime to try and make changes happen.The Goals:All concerts live streamed, 60/year to +600/year.6 concert halls, three control rooms.Streaming and download to authenticated logins.No staff increases. Full time staff size of 2, plus student workers.Pair of new control rooms for multi-camera video.Part 1: Build a Traditional Broadcast SystemStreaming is built on great video production, built on great audio quality. Getting a level of quality took us a few years of listening to faculty, and steady AV upgrades.Being at a music college, and one with the most renowned jazz program, we take our audio seriously. So in 2015 in conjunction with the FOH audio engineer we designed an expansive Dante audio network. 16 pairs of network switches in 11 locations that can run more than 2500 channels of audio. There is a dedicated writeup on that install.In 2017 I designed a video system for our flagship Winspear Hall using Canon lenses and sensors with Vinten robotics. This was the 3rd camera installation, previously Sony PTZ system in 2006 and 2,010 installs. Five cameras were installed around the hall with two on tripods. The dedicated control room was lightly remodeled, and a proper room was created for the equipment and new video encoders. We have been very happy with the image quality from cinema-style cameras, and the pure easy of use of the Vinten system for setting and recalling shots. Curious how we got a 2/3 B4 ENG lens on a super 35 camera? Gaffers tape. ….that’s a joke, …or is it?In 2017 — 2018 older multimode fiber and copper were replaced with higher strand single mode fiber. It totaled 288 strands between 12 runs involving 3 buildings. This blinking magical light in flexible glass carries the Dante audio network, SDI, and 10G video network.In 2020, for the additional concert halls I went with a more functional Panasonic PTZ cameras, AJA router, Blackmagic switchers, AJA Ki Pro recorders, and audio embedders fed from the Dante audio network. Nearly all our signals on IP and SDI are over about 30 strands of fiber. Two new control rooms were built for producing the two multi-camera halls, and smaller robotic controllers and recorders were setup in the existing larger audio studio for the three single camera spaces.Simplified capture system layoutCameras in large concert hall, WinspearCanon C200 with a Vinten robotic head in large concert hall, WinspearPrimary Control Room in large concert hall, Winspear.Keep in mind this was not just an install around COVID restrictions, but several years of planning and incremental steps. That said, the entire system can be operated remotely from home.The other very common question is how we handle copyrights:https://medium.com/@skippybla/handling-musical-copyrights-for-college-streaming-7513cafcd73aPart 2: Build the Streaming SystemsOnce the broadcast equipment was in place, the next step is to get that pretty signal on the Internet. That breaks down into two steps, the video encoding to smaller streamable files, and the website to display and manage it.The system approach uses a number of automated processes, using a flexible web content management system that controls everything from the live streaming encoders to external services and the viewer experience. Automation has the advantage of reducing staffing labor in routine procedures and in complex or access-controlled steps, and can be more accurate in moving data around than a human copying and pasting. Reduced scheduling mistakes, and reduced staffing hours make it ideal for scaling up our quantity of streamed events.The Live Stream OptionsHere is the broad overview of options for streaming a concert live, then how it is controlled and managed:1. FeaturedFor the traditional major ensemble concerts that are pushed through Youtube Live, and other platforms. They are manually started using a Haivision KB live encoder, and staffed with more senior production crew. Concerts are edited and re-processed for on-demand using the internal Wowza Streaming Engine combined with a CDN.2. InternalSDI video is processed into the bitrate ladder using on-premise encoders, pushed to our internal Wowza Streaming Engine server, and then to a content delivery network (Fastly). Encoded files are saved and used for immediate on-demand. The process is mostly automated.3. Mux.comA single high bitrate feed is set from an AJA Helo video encoder to their service to process to a bitrate ladder and create live and on-demand stream links that are embedded in our website. The process is mostly automated.Overview of the three streaming options.Provider ChoicesMy first choice on video encoding is to use an on-premises multi-bitrate encoder as it can give the best first-generation encode quality, and greatest control over the streaming video experience. The larger encoders are more stable, loaded with features, and can have great APIs for automation. We also stream enough events that the upfront encoder cost makes more sense than cloud usage.However in this first rollout I was not able to get more encoding hardware, so I integrated with a service, Mux, to provide the live processing, and also content delivery for when our current encoders can’t handle the simultaneous encoding load.Mux is a new service that is developer-focused. While a little spartan with features and web UI, it has a straightforward guide to getting streams in and out of their system with their API. Quality is good enough for our recital purposes, and the cost is reasonable. If the thought of code gives you anxiety then this isn’t for you.Why Not Use Youtube?It is technically possible to use, but I found the time of manually synchronizing events or web development costs to automate to be too high compared to other solutions. Also Youtube comes with baggage such as copyright strikes from Content ID, lack of authenticated videos features, and ok video quality. It is just more complexity to get live streaming automated the way we needed it for the majority of our events. It works better as a platform, not as a service.We will still use Youtube Live for premiere events. With Youtube does come positives like notifications for subscribers, copyright matching, and other features that make Youtube work well. However it will be for much fewer events that are manually controlled, for now, and this may change in the future.Facebook is a disaster. Live copyright takedowns that are incorrect, inflated viewership, login required, low quality encoding, no automation unless you build an app…To make automated streams work, components needed to be written:A read-only endpoint to get concert halls and concert entry data.Scripts to control the live streaming encoders.Code to handle the processing of video, and interaction with external service APIs.The Brain; ExpressionEngine:My content management system for the last decade has been ExpressionEngine due to the flexibility in organizing datatypes and fields. As our integrations with web services change, changes in concert program metadata, or features like streaming video are added, ExprssionEngine’s data organization and structure easily handles the changes live. CraftCMS shares similar theology, and roots, and in a complete rebuild situation it would be wise to evaluate it as well.Other writeup using waveforms in the audio player and targeted searching that relate to using EE:https://medium.com/@skippybla/rebuilding-the-player-experience-66c6271632c7https://medium.com/@skippybla/decreasing-surfing-7f093ef5eb27EE’s Channels (in pink) are setup like so:ExpressionEngine Channel layoutA concert entry is linked to, say, a hall. The Hall entry has fields for storing the video encoder and recorder setup that represents how the system is wired in the real-world. With the two linked, the entry can include the hall’s encoder configuration. This information can be returned as a sort of API, and used in further scripting and encoder automation.JSON Output for a concert hall.Easy to change options in the hall’s entry. These are for controlling the AJA Ki Pro video recorders.EE is conceptually running half as a traditional website and half with the templates generating all the html markup, and half as headless. For headless, templates return json. Then javascript, like Vue, handle the displaying of data to a viewer with live updating, or stand-alone scripts use the json data to control encoders and other audio and video hardware.As devices change, their parameters can be added as fields in ExpressionEngine, added to the JSON output template, and included in scripting. The same applies for services. If Vimeo was added as an option, then it is simply adding an extension to retrieve streaming keys, store those in the entry in fields, and outputting those in the JSON feed for further scripting.ExpressionEngine does carry some work ingesting data like an API, and becomes problematic for webhooks from external services like Mux. To get around this as simply as possible, though probably not the more correct way, I have a stand-alone script that saves webhook data to a local file, then EE reads that file (being sure to sanitize it).Live Concert Stream Workflow:From event import to live stream.Step 1: Getting Events Automatically From Calendar SystemConcerts are scheduled using an old custom-written web application that is no longer getting new features. So I setup a polling script to get its event data at regular intervals into ExpressionEngine. A webhook would be ideal here of course.Once the ExpressionEngine site has the event data, it can function like a typical calendar with upcoming events, and be the foundation for controlling live streaming.Step 2: Using Hooks To Setup Live StreamsWhen concert entries are created or updated a hook allows for additional scripts to be run at that moment. I created Extensions scripts that work with various services to automate the process of getting various keys and hashes.One extension creates live streams with Mux.com. If the room is enabled for Mux (set by the Hall), the script makes an API request to Mux to create a new live stream. Mux returns a stream key for the encoder, and stream key for the player. Both are then stored in the EE concert entry. One script polls the JSON feed to get the stream key, and updates the live encoder. The front-end template outputs the playback key.Other services include updating Algolia for search, JW Player for analytics, and Zapier for notifications and other automation magic.Step 3: Automatic StreamingTo automatically start and stop events, each live encoder brand is controlled by individual stand-alone script since each brand has slightly different API quirks. This script is run every minute to control start, stop, and set stream names.Simplified PHP script for the AJA Helo controlStep 4: The Viewer ExperienceWhat the viewer sees on the public side with the player is handled completely by ExpressionEngine and its template system, along with libraries like Vue for interactivity. It controls showing a pre-show message, starting the player, and then stopping the player.Student and staff workers simply have to point the cameras, and the stream is automatically started, the Ki Pro video recorders have event file names, and all are start and stop automatically. There are also a manually-started recorders just incase, but this way at least one of the two systems will get things right!UI features include the countdown for when it goes live, downloading calendar reminders, and the program. Statistically I found that extras like hall descriptions, and ensemble info are rarely looked at and increase bloat to the site, so those were dropped.I find it is really important on the front-end (what the public sees) not to organize events by concert hall. If I’m looking for a friend’s concert live stream then the hall is one extra piece of information needed to find the event that is irrelevant since I’m not physically going there. While our behind-the-scenes workflows are based around a hall’s technical ability, on the viewer side the hall should not be emphasized.Post Production: On-Demand and DownloadOn-Demand PlayerConcerts are made available to university members through an authenticated archive. It includes streaming video, video downloads, and audio.The system automatically creates the AAC audio with concert program metadata and artwork (screenshot) along with waveform data for streaming on the front-end. Simple ffmpeg encoding on the server.Video takes a little more. There are three workflows for on-demand delivery:1a. Mux to On-DemandLive streams using Mux are immediately made available for on-demand using the live stream encode. Mux’s on-demand assets are not immediately available, and so Mux send a notification to my server when they are ready.However these are unedited, and the quality of the Mux encodes are lower than we like.1b. Live to On-Demand, InternalLive streams using internal encoding are immediately made available for on-demand using the live stream encode.When a live stream is stopped, the encoder triggers a post-processing script. It creates the file directory, Wowza xml, and uses FFmpeg for metadata like length and making a thumbnail.However these too are unedited, and quality can vary.2. File EncodeEdited and mixed concerts are exported to a folder that is watched by the file encoder. The encoder takes its time to make the encodes look great. When complete, a script is triggered to put files into our storage and delivery location. Timecode for each piece is added to the concert entry for markers workers. Last, ExpressionEngine is updated that the post-encoded files are ready.All the ProRes recordings are stored on a system on campus, and maintained by our IT team, thank goodness. Compressed streaming files are also stored on their system and connected closely with the Wowza Streaming Engine server. Audio and video downloads are stored on a drive connected to the webserver for better transfers, however eventually the plan is to move video downloads to be served by a separate server.Keeping Track of FilesThe filename contains EE’s entry ID to keep the live and post-production files linked to ExpressionEngine outside of the hooks and lifecycle. It can then be easily parsed out, and used in a query to get the full concert info.Simple example to get the concert entry from a filename.Video Processing Status for concertsReal-World Results:So far so good.

An introduction to Babel,https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/an-introduction-to-babel-545ac22bca67?source=tag_archive---------14-----------------------,"JavaScript,Babel,Programming,Web Development,Coding","Source: https://unsplash.com/What is Babel?Babel is a tool to help us transpile newer versions of JavaScript code such as ES6 into older versions of JavaScript: it even helps you transpile TypeScript.Babel reads the source code based on the configs you define for it and compiles newer JavaScript features such as arrow functions or optional chaining. This happens with Babel’s three major tools:First, Babel’s parser takes the JavaScript code and converts it to an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) which is the structure of the source code understandable by the computer.Next, Babel’s traverser takes the AST, explores it, and modify it to the intended code we defined in our Babel configs.Lastly, Babel’s generator will translate the modified AST back to the regular code.Babel usageBabel can be installed as a package dependency through NPM package manager.We are going to install these dependencies after initializing the project directory:babel cli — this is a very nice tool to compile JavaScript files using the command linebabel-plugin-transform-async-to-generator — with this plugin, we tell Babel to transpile only a certain feature for us; in this case ES7’s async function featurebabel-preset-es2015 — this is a collection of babel plugins that allow babel to transpile ES6 (or in other words ES2015) features:// use `cd` to go to the right directory and then runmkdir babel_project// initialize a package.jsonnpm init// install babel-cli as a tool for running babel, as well as its presets and pluginsnpm install --save-dev babel-cli babel-preset-es2015 babel-plugin-transform-async-to-generatorAfter installing the CLI and related presets and plugins, we need a place to define top-level babel settings. For this, we are gonna create a .babelrc file in the root directory. Here is how the code in this file could look like:{    ""presets"": [""es2015""],    ""plugins"": [""transform-async-to-generator""]}In the next step, we build a file async.js file, with an async function to test babel against it://  async.jsconst fetch = require(""node-fetch"")async function getData() {    let res = await          fetch(""https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1"")    let json = await res.json()    console.log('data', json);}getData();// result:// ▶Object {userId: 1, id: 1, title: ""delectus aut autem"", completed: false}We would run babel CLI using this command:npx babel async.jsTo run babel against a certain file, you can use this command:npx babel async.js --out-file async.transpiled.js --source-mapsIn this way, we specify the name of the transpiled file as well as the source map file; which will help us in debugging by telling the browser which line of the transpiled file matches the original file. To see how an example of how babel can transpile this file to ES5, make sure to check here.Running babel through a CLI could work on a simple example like this, but in real applications, we would prefer to add it as part of the build process. In a typical project, the build process consists of transpiring, minifying, beautifying, minifying, or output builds which can be handled through a tool like parcel.Let’s see how we can set this up; To do that, we set up our package.json file:{    ""name"": ""babel"",    ""version"": ""1.0.0"",    ""description"": """",    ""main"": ""index.html"",    ""scripts"": {    ""start"": ""parcel index.html --open"",    ""build"": ""parcel build index.html""},""dependencies"": {    ""babel-preset-es2015"": ""6.24.1"",    ""node-fetch"": ""2.6.0""},""devDependencies"": {    ""@babel/core"": ""7.2.0"",    ""@babel/plugin-transform-async-to-generator"": ""7.9.5"",    ""parcel-bundler"": ""^1.6.1""},""keywords"": []}At this point, running npm run-script build should handle the transpiling for us now. Please note that we are using Parcel as a bundler/builder for this example, which has Babel as a built-in transformer.JavaScript In Plain EnglishNew JavaScript + Web Development articles every day.Follow53 JavaScriptBabelProgrammingWeb DevelopmentCoding53 claps53 clapsWritten byKasraFollowChief Problem Solver @ MyToolBox.DevFollowJavaScript In Plain EnglishFollowNew JavaScript + Web Development articles every day.FollowWritten byKasraFollowChief Problem Solver @ MyToolBox.DevJavaScript In Plain EnglishFollowNew JavaScript + Web Development articles every day.More From MediumThe Easiest Way To Start Using Swagger in Node.jsGrant Leadbetter in The StartupBinary Search Algorithm 101Tom Sanderson in The StartupReact Hooks in Action: Building a Todo App (hint: no classes)Shuvo HabibHow to Setup Node Express Server to mock APIs response locallyWeb Boys in Analytics VidhyaCallbacks in JavaScriptPopa VladAn Illustrated Guide to JavaScript’s Map MethodDaire Ní Chatháin in JavaScript In Plain EnglishThe bare minimum on Closures and Global Scope in JavaScriptGreg ByrneBuild an Interactive CLI Using TypeScriptKenan Christian Dimas in Better ProgrammingLearn more.Medium is an open platform where 170 million readers come to find insightful and dynamic thinking."
Best Features of ES2018— Async Iteration,https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/best-features-of-es2018-async-iteration-be383df9635e?source=tag_archive---------15-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by sydney Rae on UnsplashSince 2015, JavaScript has improved immensely.It’s much more pleasant to use it now than ever.In this article, we’ll look at the best features of ES2018.Async IterationWith ES6, JavaScript introduced the for-of loop.It lets us synchronously iterate through iterable objects.However, there's no way to iterate asynchronously.ES2018 introduced the async iteration feature to fill this gap.Synchronous iteration works with any object that has the Symbol.iterator method, which is a generator method.It returns each item with sequentially when the next next method is called.The returned object has the value returned from the generator, which is the current entry that the iterator hits.It also has the done property to indicate whether all th values have been returned.For instance, if we have:const iterable = ['foo', 'bar'];const iterator = iterable[Symbol.iterator]();Then when we call:iterator.next()the first time, we get:{ value: 'foo', done: false }Then when we call it again, we get;{ value: 'b', done: false }And when we call it one more time, we get:{ value: undefined, done: true }The iteration is synchronous, so we can’t iterate asynchronously.We want to be able to call promises in an iterable object one by one.This is solved with the for-await-of loop.For instance, we can use it by writing:async function main() {  const arr = [    Promise.resolve('foo'),    Promise.resolve('bar'),  ];  for await (const x of arr) {    console.log(x);  }}main();We have an array of promises that we iterate through.They’ll be run one by one.So we get:foobarlogged in the console log.The for-await-of loop also works with synchronous iterables.So we can write:async function main() {  for await (const x of ['foo', 'bar']) {    console.log(x);  }}main();And we get the same results logged.Async GeneratorsAsync generators let us create async iterable.An async generator is just a generator function that returns promises.For instance, we can create an async generator function by writing:async function* createAsyncIterable(arr) {  for (const elem of arr) {    yield elem;  }}A normal generator returns a generator object.And each invocation of the next method returns an object with the properties value and done .And an async generator returns a generator object.Each next call returns a promise for an object with properties value and done .When we call an async generator, the JavaScript engine will wait for the promise to be settled before calling the next one.Every async generator has a queue with promises to be settled with yield or throw .And when next is called, a promise is queued.And unless the async generator is already running, it resumes and waits for the promise to be finished.It can finish with yield , throw or return await .Once it’s finished the promise is returned.The result of a settled promise is delivered in an async manner.Photo by Gabriel Gusmao on UnsplashConclusionThe for-await-of loop lets us iterate through async generators by returning promises of each value sequentially.JavaScript In Plain EnglishEnjoyed this article?

[React] How to create a custom Hook to fetch async data from API whenever the page loads,https://medium.com/@samip227/react-how-to-create-a-custom-usefetch-hook-to-fetch-async-data-from-api-whenever-the-page-loads-db4d307482fb?source=tag_archive---------16-----------------------,"React,React Native,Reactjs,Hooks,Web Development","Photo by Artem Sapegin on Unsplash. Why is he using a white background theme but? Argghh.. my eyes…React hooks give us the ability to … boring.Ok.Let's get started.Use CaseFetch data from an API asynchronously whenever the page loads. We are going to do this by creating a custom hook on top of using the useEffect hook (which is comparable to componentDidMount for class components).Typically this is how you would use useEffect to fetch data from an API. I am continuing from where ROBIN WIERUCH left off in his nice article about using useEffect. If you haven’t used useEffect hook before I recommend checking that article out.Sample use of useEffectBut what if …What if we could extract this whole piece of code between lines 12 and 26 into a custom hook which could then be reused in multiple components (e.g. different pages of your application).Since this is going to be a reusable hook, we need to make it accept the URL parameter dynamically.Furthermore, since the isError and isLoading properties are used to render the correct data (or spinner or error message), there needs to be a way for the component to be able to access these from our custom hook.Let’s see how we can do thisAs per the React docs:A custom Hook is a JavaScript function whose name starts with ”use” and that may call other Hooks.So we will create a new hook called useFetchEffect.jsThis is how our custom hook looks like:useFetchEffect.jsWoah, what just happened there?A custom hook is just a function that can run in your component.So basically we are abstracting the useEffect (to run whenever your component mounts) and fetching the data inside there. (line 9–24)Then we are returning the loading state, error state, and the retrieved data (line 26–28).This is how your component will now look like. Notice how we are using the reusable useFetchEffect hook.Component using our new custom HookIt’s important to remember that for all means and purposes, our custom useFetchEffect hook is just another function. That means it’s just like all of the code is run inside our component including the useEffect.What if I want to customize my useEffectSince you can use multiple useEffect in your components you can add ass many useEffect hooks in your component as you want.So you can just add them on, like so:Now let’s look at How To …Resuse our custom hook in multiple componentsAll these shenanigans are of use only if we are able resuse this component in different pages/components that need to fetch data from API.If you notice our custom hook accepts a url parameter. By passing different urls to different components, we can resuse this component everywhere.e.g.Reusing our custom hook in another componentLastly, most people will be using redux thunk or other middleware to actually fetch and save the data into a redux store or another state container.With redux, we typically use thunk action creators to fetch the data.We can modify our component to support a callback method as a parameters(instead of the url that we are currently using).This will allow us pass in the relevant thunk action creator into the component to fetch data like so.Then we simply modify our custom hook to use the callback function instead of the axios function.Feel free to discuss or give me feedback in comments.Cheers and happy weekend.End.Written bySamip ShahFollowReactReact NativeReactjsHooksWeb DevelopmentMore from Samip ShahFollowMore From MediumJavaScript Interviews: What’s the Difference Between a Variable That’s null, undefined, or…Andrew Koenig-Bautista in Better ProgrammingJSON Web Signature (JWS) and JWS Detached for a five-year-oldTomasz Zwierzchoń in The StartupMermaid — Create Charts and Diagrams With Markdown-like SyntaxIndrek Lasn in Better ProgrammingBuilding an Ionic Multi App Project with Shared Angular LibrarySimon Grimm in Angular In DepthAdventures in the Virtual DOM — Part 1: Defining the ProblemKevin B.

Integrate Smoothstate.js to WordPress Portfolio,https://medium.com/@stevahnes/integrate-smoothstate-js-to-wordpress-portfolio-cb41d4badc7?source=tag_archive---------17-----------------------,"WordPress,Jquery,Web Development,JavaScript,Wordpress Web Development","I have always used WordPress for my personal website/portfolio. I started with the SaaS version that is WordPress.com, before transitioning into WordPress.org earlier this year. Like many have told me, WordPress.org indeed opened up a lot more possibilities compared to WordPress.com, courtesy of its mature theme and plugin ecosystem, as well as better access to HTML and CSS customizations. It was truly a state of “whatever you can think of, you can build”.A traditional WordPress site, where the whole page refreshes on navigation into another page. (Credit: https://perkcoffee.co/)However, for the longest time, I thought a WordPress site would always be that: a WordPress site. I thought there was no way I could get the transition that modern site builders offer, where only part of the page refreshes on navigation into another page.What we are aiming for! As you can see, only the “difference” is re-rendered; the rest (in this case the header) is unchanged. (Credit: https://thedieline.com/)Until I came across a certain JavaScript library called Smoothstate.js (and its close competitor, Barba.js).I looked at tutorials on how to integrate Smoothstate.js into WordPress, and truthfully it looked simple. However, none of the tutorials provide a comprehensive guide on how to organize your WordPress site in order to ensure that everything works as it was prior to Smoothstate.js integration. After spending a whole weekend overcoming the obstacles I came across and ironing out small kinks here and there, I decided to write the whole process out with the hope that others who encounter similar struggles may benefit from this documentation.Creating a Child ThemeFirst things first, like many of the tutorials I found, I recommend creating a child theme to host all the customizations we will be doing, unless you built your own theme from scratch. The reason being that any customizations made to the parent theme would be lost when it is updated to the latest version, and updating all your 3rd party dependencies is highly recommended to patch up any possible security vulnerabilities.I won’t go into the details of creating a child theme, but should you need help you can find plenty of tutorials online. I would recommend following the steps provided by the 3rd party theme you selected. For example, Astra has great documentation on this and even provides a tool to generate the child theme for you! Once you are done, activate that child theme and we’ll be good to start!Aggregating Your Custom CSSThe next thing we need to do is to aggregate any custom CSS you may have written into a single file that will be enqueued on the initial load of your site, regardless of which page it’s loaded from. Whereas inline CSS added directly into your HTML will still be rendered properly with Smoothstate.js, the same cannot be said with styles applied through a class attribute. I believe if you use a plugin like Autoptimize that has the option to aggregate your CSS into a single file, you may be able to skip this step. However, should you decide to do it anyway, let me share with you the two ways this can be done:Adding all your CSS directly in WordPress Customizer’s built-in CSS editor. You can access this through Appearance → Customize → Additional CSS. The advantage of doing it this way is that you can preview your changes live, as long as you’ve added the respective classes into your HTML in each page.Adding all your CSS into the stylesheet of your child theme. You can access this Appearance → Theme Editor. Select your child theme, and edit the style.css file. You won’t be able to see the changes live if you take this route, but I personally decided to do it this way because I installed a plugin called HTML Editor Syntax Highlighter, which color codes my classes and CSS attributes nicely.The two methods to aggregate all CSS: Customizer’s Built-In Editor (Top) or Theme Editor’s Stylesheet (Bottom).Adding Smoothstate.js into Your SiteFinally, the steps we are all here for! For integrating Smoothstate.js into WordPress, I followed the steps outlined by this tutorial. I liked this one more than the others simply because it skipped the creation of a wrapper div tag in the HTML, which may not be easy to do if you use a 3rd party theme. Both the element with “page” as an id and the element with “site-content” class seemed to be universal WordPress elements, but I might be wrong (my Astra theme do have them). If upon following this tutorial Smoothstate.js does not work, you may want to inspect your HTML in your browser.For reference, the element with “page” as an id on my site is the div tag which is the direct child of the body tag, and the element with “site-content” class is the sibling of the header tag, located directly after the latter.The first thing to do is to download the latest Smoothstate.js. Then, add the downloaded script file and another file containing the script gist below into the same folder. I personally prefer adding them both in assets/js under my child theme folder, because they will then appear under the Theme Editor together with the child theme’s stylesheet and PHP files, making editing that much easier. To do so, use your hosting provider’s FTP client.The opening of the script above is slightly different than the tutorial’s because I opted to use the jQuery bundled with WordPress, which has use-strict enabled.Once the above is done, all that’s left are to enqueue the scripts and add some CSS. For the latter, you may adopt and modify the tutorial’s CSS, as the classes it affects are not changed in the script above. Remember to add the CSS the same way following the way CSS is aggregated in the previous section. With that out of the way, open Appearance → Theme Editor and add the following lines to the functions.php file:You need to replace your-child-theme with the name of your child theme. However, if you decided to place your scripts elsewhere then you need to trace the directory accordingly.Save your changes, and run your site to see Smoothstate.js applying partial update when you navigate around your site!Ironing Out KinksSo are we done? Unfortunately not, unless you don’t use any other plugins in your site then probably you are done (then you might want to go straight to the next section). However, if you do use any other plugins to generate your site’s content, then chances are they don’t work or render properly. The reason is that when applying the changes, Smoothstate.js does not reload any stylesheet or run functions specific to that page, because technically the page is not reloaded; it’s just “updated”.Personally, none of the content-generating plugins I use require any scripts to run on load. If the same applies to you, then it’s a matter of enqueuing the required CSS file on the initial load of your site. To know what stylesheet needs to be enqueued, you can follow these simple steps:Open an incognito tab on your browser.Launch the browser’s developer console (you can do a quick Google on how to do this since the instructions are specific to each browser).Click on the Network tab of the developer console, and apply the “CSS” filter.Now, launch your site’s homepage and see what files are loaded by the browser. Take note of them.Once that’s done, open a new incognito page and repeat steps 2 to 4.If you notice any file being loaded that was not on the previous list, click on that file in the developer console and then click on the Headers tab.Look at the Request URL. It will point out where that file is fetched from. Take note of the path from “wp-content” onwards.A screenshot of Chrome’s developer console, showing one of the CSS files fetched on this page. Notice the highlighted path? That is what you should take note of.Do this for any page where you notice a rendering issue. Once you got all the additional stylesheets’ paths, head to Appearance → Theme Editor and open up the functions.php file. Now, see if there is already a stylesheet enqueuing function there. If not, create a new one and enqueue it following the snippet below:For every path you noted down, apply the code written in line number 8. Replace my-missing-theme-name with the stylesheet name, my-missing-theme-path with the stylesheet path, and my-missing-theme-version with the stylesheet version, if any (otherwise leave it as ‘’). Click on “Update File”, and try launching and navigating around your site again. Hopefully, all the rendering issues are now fixed.The above fix is only applicable to fix the missing stylesheets issue. If your plugin requires one or more functions to be run on page load, then according to this blogpost you will need to call that function again by adding it to the onAfter property of the Smoothstate.js setting.Adding a LoaderBy this stage, I hope you have a revamped site with Smoothstate.js properly integrated. If you host your site on a managed hosting plan with excellent bandwidth, then chances are you would not need this. However, if like me, you host your site on a shared hosting plan, then sometimes your site might take longer than expected to transition from one page to another. This is where the loader comes to the rescue!The idea of a loader is to provide an indicator to the user that the site is not broken. I believe that showing a visitor something is better than nothing. Yet, having a loader shown in each page transition will also be annoying to the user. Hence it’s important to tune the tolerance time before the loader is displayed.As our site now applies Smoothstate.js transitions, this loader will only be shown when a visitor is already inside your site and is transitioning between pages. It will not be shown on the initial load of your site.As we are transitioning the div tag with the “site-content” class, we will need to add the loader as a sibling to this element. We will also need to ensure that the loader takes up only the remaining space below the header, which remains unchanged throughout the visitor’s visit to the site.To do this, we would need to modify the child theme’s header.php file. However, chances are the child theme you created did not come with a header.php file. If so, all you need to do is copy the parent theme’s header.php file into the child theme using your hosting provider’s FTP client. Once that’s done, you can go to Appearance → Theme Editor and access the child theme’s header.php file. There, look for the HTML tag with the “site-content” class.Before modifying the header.php file, browser the web for or design yourself a good pure CSS loader. If you prefer adopting someone’s design, I recommend getting one from loading.io. The 12 designs shown in the hyperlink are all CC0 licensed and can thus be used freely.Copy your choice loader’s HTML tags right above the HTML tag with the “site-content” class. Give an id property to your loader so that we can easily refer to it in our script later on. You can refer to the snippet below for reference. Don’t forget to add the CSS into the aggregated CSS file following the steps in the previous section.As you can see, the loader is initialized with an inline “display: none” style attribute. We will handle the display and hiding of both the content and loader with some jQuery by augmenting the custom script we did above.With that said, head to the custom script file in the assets/js folder (or wherever you put yours just now) and prepare to do some modifications. The first thing we need to do is to tell Smoothstate.js to do something while the page is rendering. This is done by adding an onProgress property to its settings object. During onProgress, we would display the loader and hide the content. And then, in onAfter we would do the reverse.However, as discussed before, we do not want the loader to display right away all the time. Hence, we need to set a tolerance window. Only when loading takes more than the tolerance window will we show the loader to alert the visitor of the unfortunate delay. We can easily do this by calling the “setTimeout” function provided by JavaScript.However, now comes another problem! Imagine we provide a tolerance window of 1 second (1000ms). When the page is refreshing, the onProgress state initialized an internal timer to show the loader after 1 second. However, the page actually loads after 700ms, during which the onAfter procedure takes place. If we do not tell the code to stop and reset the internal timer, the loader will be shown after the page is loaded, which is wrong! Hence, we also need to modify the onAfter by adding a “clearTimeout” to reset any initiated timer before rendering the page.With all that said, the complete code can be seen in the snippet below:In the sample above, we assign a tolerance window of 1 second (1000ms). When the page is loading, the set an internal timer and assign it to the loaderTimer variable. If the page is loaded before the tolerance window, the check on if loaderTimer exists would return true and we would reset the internal timer. However, if the page takes more than 1 second to load, the internal timer would render the loader, which would be removed once the page is rendered.Adding (or Restoring) Google AnalyticsWith the above implemented properly, your site’s UI/UX should look snazzy and modern. Unfortunately, if you’ve incorporated Google Analytics into your WordPress site, it will not work correctly anymore.The reason being that when readers navigate around your site, the Analytics script is fired only once during the initial page load. Any navigation afterwards results in only partial updates of the HTML body tag. As such, scripts that normally run when page reload completes will not be run.In order to make Google Analytics track page navigations within your website again, we will need to use Autotrack, which is the official Google plugin to make Analytics work on AJAX-based website. Thus, we need to make the following changes:If you use the Google Site Kit plugin (which, you should if you haven’t), head to Settings → Analytics and switch off the “Let Site Kit place code on your site” feature.Before we re-insert the analytics script back into our site manually, we will create another custom JavaScript file (see the analytics-autotrack.js file in the gist above) and add it to our child theme’s assets/js folder.That script is basically a modification of the default script provided by Google. You can actually keep the default script if all you are interested in is the page view.Finally, let’s head to the functions.php file of the child theme and add the following code to enqueue the custom script above together with the analytics.js and autotrack.js files into our site’s header file.With the above changes, when an AJAX call is fired to navigate reader to a new page, this information will be sent to Google Analytics, thus providing you with accurate data again. What’s also nice is that any other event tracker added into the custom JavaScript file above will also be sent to Google Analytics as and when they are triggered. Neat!Phew! That was rather long. If you’ve made it to the end, congratulations, and I hope you’ve successfully applied Smoothstate.js to your WordPress site! If you read through it all but have yet to give it a go, I would strongly recommend you to do so. It is not as difficult as it looks 😄 And if you need more encouragement to do it, I hope my portfolio website will do just that!The end product of all the steps above, so worth it! As you can see, I am on a rather slow network, and the loader helped provide that “I’m working, please wait” feedback to the visitor.ReferencessmoothState.js official GitHub repositoryautotrack official GitHub repositoryAdding page transitions to WordPressHow to Integrate SmoothState.js Into a WordPress ThemePage Transitions in WordPress with SmoothStateUsing Google Analytics for Ajax Powered ThemesWritten byStevanus SatriaMechanical engineer graduate turned software engineer.

Python & Docker: The Basics,https://medium.com/swlh/python-docker-the-basics-581f17132398?source=tag_archive---------18-----------------------,"Python,Docker,Programming,Containers,Web Development","Photo by Todd Cravens on UnsplashSometimes you just want to dip your toe into a potentially deep and complex subject. Maybe you only have 10 minutes to spare and you want to get something up and running quickly.In 10 minutes time you will be able to say:‘Oh yes, I’ve used Docker with Python’.Install DockerThis is as simple as going to: https://www.docker.com/get-started, downloading and running the installer for your system.One Folder, Two FilesOpen up a terminal window and create a folder for your project:$ mkdir hello-world$ cd hello-worldIn your favourite editor create two files (app.py & Dockerfile) in this folder:andNow in the terminal type:$ docker image build -t hello-world .This will use the Dockerfile to create an image tagged (-t) with a repository name of ‘hello-world’ using the current working directory (.). The new image is based on the offical python:3.8-slim-buster image, has its working directory set to /usr/src/app, has both files copied into this directory and its default executable set to ‘python app.py’.Now all we need to do is run the image:$ docker run hello-worldWhich should output:Hello WorldCongratulations you have just used Docker with Python!Clean up after yourselfList all your images by typing the following in the terminal:$ docker imagesThis should output something like this:REPOSITORY   TAG     IMAGE ID      CREATED             SIZE hello-world  latest  efb9753c45d0  About a minute ago  113MBThen you can delete the image by typing:$ docker rmi efb -fWhere ‘efb’ in my case was the first few letters of my image ID (yours will be different) and -f forces the delete to happen no matter what.That’s the most basic tutorial I could come up with that shows how easy it is to dockerize a python app. The benefits of portability and consistency that docker gives you as a developer are amazing and makes hosting and sharing your applications a breeze.If you prefer or need a video walkthrough of the above tutorial, check out my ‘Python & Docker — The Basics’ video here.I also have a sequel to this post: Flask & Docker: The Basics.The StartupMedium's largest active publication, followed by +723K people.

Build BREADCRUMB Component Using VUE JS,https://medium.com/swlh/build-breadcrumb-component-using-vue-js-fdb81828def4?source=tag_archive---------19-----------------------,"Programming,Coding,JavaScript,Vuejs,Web Development","Hello, Lofi Guy here. In this tutorial I will show you how to create a Breadcrumb component using Vue. If you don’t already know, the picture below is a breadcrumb component. If you prefer videos and want more details, here is the YouTube tutorial offering just that.We will just be building the presentation layer of this component, but no functionality. If I see a bunch of people wanting to know how to remove and add crumbs dynamically, then I will make a 2nd part to this tutorial. A Breadcrumb component is pretty simple, so this will be a good tutorial if you are just starting out with Vue.OutlineBootstrap: Installing Bootstrap for a few stylesBreadcrumb Component: Creating the core componentApp.vue: Adding the component to this file in order to show your breadcrumb in the browserNOTE: I will not cover detailed project setup in this article, I am starting from a basic Vue app that was just created using vue create crumbs and I am using Visual Studio Code.Alright, let’s get started.BootstrapJust like with my tab navigator tutorial, first thing we need to do is download and import Bootstrap so that we can get a few styles. Again, we don’t need these styles, but it makes things a lot easier so that we don’t have to reinvent the wheel.Download it in the terminal with:npm install bootstrapNow open the file called main.js and paste this at the top:import ‘bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css’;Cool, now you have the CSS part of Bootstrap.Breadcrumb componentNow let’s create the Breadcrumb component, it isn’t too complicated.Inside the components folder create a file called Breadcrumb.vue (refer to my video if this early stuff is confusing you).I am going to give you the entire code for this component and then explain the most confusing parts after:props: {  crumbs: {    type: Array,    required: true,  },},You see that the component is taking in one prop called crumbs. This is simply an array of strings that we will create in App.vue to define the crumbs we want to display.methods: {  isLast(index) {    return index === this.crumbs.length - 1;  },  selected(crumb) {    this.$emit('selected', crumb);  },},After that, there are two methods defined.isLast: This method simply takes in an index of the crumb array and checks if that crumb is the last one in the list. We use this in the template.selected: This is a simple method that emits an event whenever a crumb is selected. The event is then caught by App.vue…we will write that soon.<nav>  <ol class=""breadcrumb"">    <li      v-for=""(crumb, ci) in crumbs""      :key=""ci""      class=""breadcrumb-item align-items-center""    >      <button class=""btn btn-link"" :class=""{ disabled: isLast(ci) }"" @click=""selected(crumb)"">        {{ crumb }}      </button>    </li>  </ol></nav>Here we use v-for=”(crumb, ci) in crumbs” to loop through each crumb. There will be a list item and button element for each crumb in the list. “ci” stands for crumb index and we pass it to the key attribute because Vue will complain if you don’t.All of the styles you see are Bootstrap selectors, they simply make everything look nice.:class=""{ disabled: isLast(ci) }""is a dynamic style. If this is the last crumb in the list, then Bootstrap’s disabled selector will be used to disable that last crumb. That just makes it look dull and not clickable.@click=""selected(crumb)"" just makes sure that whenever a crumb is clicked, it calls the selected method which then emits an event called selected. Also, it sends the name of the crumb with the event. This really isn’t necessary for a presentation component, but it sets the stage for functionality.<style scoped>.breadcrumb {  background-color: white;  border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.125);  border-radius: 0.37rem;}</style>.breadcrumb is a Bootstrap style, but we also add some of our own styles to it. I think it is fairly obvious what it does. If not, experiment with taking it out and putting it back in. That’s how you learn CSS.App.vueThis is where we will use our Breadcrumb component and display it on the screen. Again, I’ll explain everything after the code.<template>  <div id=""app container"">    <Breadcrumb class=""row justify-content-center mt-4"" :crumbs=""crumbs"" @selected=""selected"" />  </div></template>Starting from the top, the template is where we actually add the Breadcrumb to be displayed. Several Bootstrap styles are used in order to center everything on the screen. Feel free to experiment with them.You can see a crumbs prop is passed in. We will define the array of crumbs in just a second in the data. Then, @selected=”selected” is used to catch an event named selected that comes from our Breadcrumb…which then calls a method named selected that we will create in just a second.crumbs: [‘Home’, ‘Category’,’Sub category’], defines our array of crumbs that will be displayed. You can name these anything you want.selected(crumb) { console.log(crumb); }, — This method really isn’t necessary for this tutorial, but if we wanted to make it so that when you clicked on a crumb something happened, this is where the code for some sort of action would go. As I said in the beginning, I will create a part 2 doing just that if desired, but it will be different for every scenario, just depends what you want to do with your crumbs.After all of that, if you start your server with npm run serve you should see a Breadcrumb. Too easy! If you do not see it, you better reread this or check out the YouTube video to make sure you didn’t forget anything.ConclusionThis tutorial should have taught you how to create a Breadcrumb component and show it on the screen. This is a good component for beginners because creating it requires you to understand a little about Vue, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap in a simple manner. I hope that I was able to help you out today.

Improve Your Web App Performance By Serving Static Files in Compressed Format,https://medium.com/swlh/improve-your-web-app-performance-by-serving-static-files-in-compressed-form-2646316b369?source=tag_archive---------20-----------------------,"Web Development,Web Performance,JavaScript,DevOps,Front End Development","I am new in web development and I find it very useful to implement this in production build for performance improvement. And here, I’ll try to share this and hopefully it will be useful for you too!Please note that if you use Content Delivery Network (CDN) like Cloudflare or Amazon Cloudfront, this functionality has already provided. So you don’t have to handle it manually.Sample project I use to demonstrate this purpose was using several technical stack which are :React JS as front end libraryAWS S3 as web hosting servicegzipper, a node package for compressing your static files.etc (other stacks which are not relevant for this purpose)First of all, you’ll need to know on what level your app’s performance are. For this, I use Lighthouse Audits in Chrome’s DevTools. Just open DevTools (right click => inspect), then open Audits tab, and click “Run audits” button. Here is how my sample apps performance looks like:8/100, 7.24 seconds (lighthouse estimation) might be saved if we serve the statics in compressedIt was pretty bad, scored 8/100 and 7.24 seconds (estimated) wasted. So I tried to do some research for static files (text) compression. And then I knew that almost all browsers support for accepting static files in compressed format like gzip, brotli, and deflate. I choose gzip because according to my research, all modern browsers support that format.Manually Compress Static Files to GZIPOkay, so now, the “how” part to do compression manually. First you can install any package to compress the files. I use gzipper. To install it, type this in your project’s root directory in terminal:$ npm install gzipperor$ yarn add gzipperif you use yarn.Next step is to adjust your build command so that anytime you build your static files, gzipper then compress it into gzip format. Since I use react and ubuntu, here is how my build scripts looks like in package.json:“scripts”: {""build”: “react-scripts build && gzipper — verbose ./build ./dist — output-file- format [filename].[ext]”,}This command here means that after you build your react script, it will compress all files in ./build directory and save the output files in ./dist. So when I deploy the app, I will deploy the files from ./dist which already compressed instead of from ./build.After that, you should set up the hosting server to make sure that it will return http response which includes “content-encoding: gzip” if you use gzip compression, or br for brotli, and deflate for deflate. You can check if it works correctly by inspecting the deployed app, and check in network tab in DevTools, and choose any static files that the browser requested. If it works correctly, you will see something like this:When you set the hosting server http response rule correctly it will show the content-encoding rule, that gives info for the browser to process the file as gzip compressed file.I mentioned that not all browsers support all compression format. You can check what type of compression that the browser support by checking http request header in DevTools’ network tab.Chrome browser supported compression format. It support gzip, deflate, and brotli compression.When everything work well, you can run Lighthouse Audits again to see the effect. In my case it works very well and jumped the performance level from 8 to 71. After all, this compression thing really help my project performance.Significant performance increase after serve static files in compressed 8 to 71.With Content Delivery Network (Cloudflare)If you use Content Delivery Network like Cloudflare or Amazon Cloudfront, you can use their provided functionality for files compression. For Example on my unit conversion project, I use Cloudflare and in the settings of the project, in speed => optimization, you can find the option of which you can choose to apply brotli compression or not.You can set up compression easily if you use CDN like cloudflareSo simple with CDN isn’it ?ConclusionUsing static files compression sometimes really helps to improve your web performance. In my case, it really helps me to jump my app performance from 8/100 to 71/100. To do that you can manually do the compression, deploy it, and set the server to give “content-encoding” response or you can just do it all by using Content Delivery Network provider like cloudflare to make it all simple.The StartupMedium's largest active publication, followed by +723K people.

"React Tips — Formik Blur, Router Navigation, Context Value Change",https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/react-tips-formik-blur-router-navigation-context-value-46514716e8f2?source=tag_archive---------21-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Dave Oliver on UnsplashReact is a popular library for creating web apps and mobile apps.In this article, we’ll look at some tips for writing better React apps.Ternary Operator in JSX to Include HTMLWe can add the ternary operator to include HTML by writing the followingrender () {  return (    <div>      {(this.state.message === 'success')          ? <div>successful</div>           : <div>not successful</div>       }    </div>  );}Change Context Value While Using React Hook of useContextWe can pass in the state change function to the context to let us call them anywhere.This way, we can change the value in whatever component that receives the context.For example, we can write:const { createContext, useContext, useState } = React;const ThemeContext = createContext({});function Content() {  const { style, color, toggleStyle, changeColor } = useContext(    ThemeContext  );  return (    <div>      <p>        {color} {style}      </p>      <button onClick={toggleStyle}>Change style</button>      <button onClick={() => changeColor('green')}>Change color</button>    </div>  );}function App() {  const [style, setStyle] = useState(""light"");  const [color, setColor] = useState(true);  function toggleStyle() {    setStyle(style => (style === ""light"" ? ""dark"" : ""light""));  }  function changeColor(color) {    setColor(color);  }  return (    <ThemeContext.Provider      value={{ style, visible, toggleStyle, changeColor }}    >      <Content />    </ThemeContext.Provider>  );}We created the ThemeContext , which we use in the App component to get the provider and wrap that around the Content component.Then we pass our state change functions with the state variables into the context by passing them into the object in the value prop.Then in the Content component, we can call the toggleStyle and toggleStyle and changeColor functions to change the states in App .We get those functions in Content with the useContext hook.Simulate a Change Event with EnzymeWe can simulate a change event with Enzyme by creating a spy for the handle change method.For instance, we can write:it(""responds to name change"", done => {  const handleChangeSpy = sinon.spy(Form.prototype, ""handleChange"");  const event = { target: { name: ""name"", value: ""spam"" }};  const wrap = mount(    <Form />  );  wrap.ref('name').simulate('change', event);  expect(handleChangeSpy.calledOnce).to.equal(true);})We create a spy for our change event listener.Then we set our event object.And then we mount our Form component that we want to test.And then we trigger the change event on it with the simulate method.Then we checked that the spy is called once.How to Use Custom onChange and onBlur with React FormikWe can create our own blur handler by writing:<Field    component={MyInput}    name=""email""    type=""email""    onBlur={e => {        handleBlur(e)        let someValue = e.currentTarget.value        //...    }}/>We call the built-in handleBlur function.Then we do something else in the lines after.How to Use React Router with ElectronWe can use React Router in an Electron app with the HashRouter ,For instance, we can write:<HashRouter  basename={basename}  getUserConfirmation={() => {}}  hashType='slash'>  <App /></HashRouter>basename is a string with the base URL for all locations.getUserConfirmation is a function that lets us use to confirm navigation.hashType is a string that has the encoding to use for window.location.hash .The possible values are 'slash' , which is #/ .'noslash' is # .And 'hashbang' us #!/ .Cannot Read Property ‘push’ of undefined With React RouterWe can use the withRouter higher-order component to make the history object available.For instance, we can write:class App extends React.Component {  constructor(props) {    super(props);    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);  }  handleClick(value) {    this.props.history.push('/dashboard');  }  render() {    return (      <div>        <Route          exact          path=""/""          render={() => (            <div>              <h1>Welcome</h1>            </div>          )}       />       <Route         path=""/dashboard""         render={() => (           <div>             <h1>Dashboard</h1>           </div>         )}      />      <button onClick={this.handleClick} >go to dashboard</button>    );  }}export default withRouter(App);We have several routes and a handleClick method to let us go to the dashboard route.We have the this.props.history.push method because we called withRouter higher-order component with App .Photo by Jack Catalano on UnsplashConclusionWe can navigate to routes programmatically with withRouter .We can pass anything to a context so that we can use them anywhere else.Formik’s blur handler can be replaced with our own function.JavaScript In Plain EnglishEnjoyed this article?

Django on GoDaddy VPS Part 1,https://medium.com/python-in-plain-english/install-django-on-godaddy-vps-af062dd4be70?source=tag_archive---------22-----------------------,"Django,Godaddy,Vps,Python,Web Development","This is the first article of the series “Django on GoDaddy VPS”. In this article we’re going to install Django on GoDaddy VPS.The links to my other articles of the Series are listed at the end of this article.GoDaddy is currently offering 4 standard RAM plans and 4 high RAM plans. I chose the lowest one for my light use and low budget:You will get an email from GoDaddy once your server is set up and ready to use. Then you can go back to the hosting setting page on GoDaddy to set up the VPS. For the purpose of having a clean view and showing everything in detail, I decided to rebuild the server and we will walk through everything together step by step. So first, let’s go to GoDaddy->My Hosting->Settings:Now the server has been rebuilt and you can see our dedicated IP address assigned by GoDaddy is: 132.148.167.142Open the Terminal as we’re on a mac and then enter the command below to connect to our VPS.ssh [username]@[IP address]The next step is to install Homebrew. If you want to know more about Homebrew, here is the official website:HomebrewThe Missing Package Manager for macOS (or Linux).brew.shBut before installing Homebrew, we need to install Git first by entering the commands below in the Terminal.sudo apt updatesudo apt upgradesudo apt install gitNow it’s time to install Homebrew:/bin/bash -c “$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)""Everything looked good, but we got a warning as shown in the screenshot above. And when we ran the command brew doctor , we’re told the Homebrew was not installed. What should we do? The solution is just to follow the “Next steps” in the screenshot above and done.sudo apt-get install build-essentialecho 'eval $(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)' >> /home/[username]/.profileeval $(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)brew install gccThe next step is to install the latest version of Python 3:brew install python3After updating to the latest version of Python 3, let’s install Pipenv to manage virtual environments.brew install pipenvLet’s create a new directory “test” and use Pipenv to create a new virtual environment and install Django 3.1.1 in it at the same time.mkdir test && cd testpipenv install django==3.1.1We need to activate the virtual environment to create our Django project called “test_project”.pipenv shelldjango-admin startproject test_project .Don’t forget the period “.” at the end!Great, the project was created! Then we need to open the Django Settings file to add our [VPS IP address] in “ALLOWED_HOSTS” in order to make our Django site available on Internet when we run the development server. So let’s open nano editor to edit the settings file in the Terminal:cd test_projectnano settings.pyAfter opening the settings file, we need to locate the “ALLOWED_HOSTS” setting and add our [VPS IP address] inside.Once it’s done, press control+x to save and exit. And then go back to the directory “test” to activate the development server:cd ..python manage.py runserver [VPS IP address:8000]Let’s enter our VPS IP address followed by :8000 in the browser:Bingo!

The Best Royalty Free Stock Photos to Apply in Your Blog,https://medium.com/swlh/the-best-royalty-free-stock-photos-to-apply-in-your-blog-5e55859cb5e8?source=tag_archive---------23-----------------------,"Web Development,Food,Ethics,Coding,Fashion","Our lives are surrounded by images, some moving, some others still: television, billboards, bus stops, and trains are full of ads that are mostly images. A picture is worth a thousand words, they say, and blogs make no difference.That’s because the little idiom above is true: when we see a picture, thousands of words, feelings, and emotions flood our senses.Adding images to your blogs and articles is critical if you want to grab your reader’s attention and stay there long enough to engage in meaningful dialogue with them.However, you will not be able to take pictures from the internet and use them on your blogs unless you want the copyright police to give you a break. All images are the property of their creator unless the rights to the image are specifically granted to another person.If you want (and should) use photos in your articles,you have 3 options:Use images that are not protected by copyright, e.g., those of your images you employ a camera or a phone to captureUse the copyrighted or non-copyrighted (royalty-free) type of imagesUse images for which you are paying a license. In these cases, you do not own the copyright, but the copyright owner grants you a license for a particular use.1. You Want To Own Your ImagesIt’s fun to take pictures, and now it’s easier than ever to take pictures employing a camera or smartphone.The benefit of creating your images is that you are the copyright owner and can configure exactly what you want to photograph to make your blog perfect. I’m also always looking for interesting pictures or photo opportunities that I think I can use at a later date.Examples of things that you can generate yourself are:Pictures from your very own cameraGraphics you create on your computer using your software or web software such as Canva.com.Screenshots from your computer: These are usually used in training videos and similar things to show you how to do something.Banners or ads to use on websites2. The Best Royalty Free Stock Photos For Commercial UseThe images without copyright are just that: free images that you can use for the purpose you want. Peoples will take photos or create graphics and upload them to royalty-free websites, renouncing their copyrights and allowing others to use the images.In some cases, you can use the images for free if you give attribution (or credit) to the copyright owner so you may need to add a title to the image to indicate who the copyright owner is or where you got the image from.Some Of The Best Sites I Use For Blog Images Are:Pixabay.comI like this website and the images that they offer; also it’s usually my first stop. They have some excellent pictures of many different topics. When you sign up for Pixabay, you can search millions of images using the search bar, depending on the label or tag the creator has added to the image.All pictures here are free to use and also for commercial purposes. In general, you can also choose the quality/ resolution/size you want to download. Some images have transparent backgrounds that can be very useful for creating layers in your graphics because you can apply layers to the image with different backgrounds.One of the drawbacks I’ve found with Pixabay is that some pictures appear over and over again in the blogs so you may find that the same picture is being used over and over again. That’s not a big problem, and if you want to avoid this, I recommend you look a little more in the search results instead of just taking pictures from the first page of the results.The top banners of the images that are returned come from Shutterstock, a website that offers royalty paid, so you learn to ignore them unless a specific image is there which you need.If you use a lot of pictures from Pixabay, you have the opportunity to buy coffee for a creator if you like his work, which means that you can donate some money to use the picture, but there is no pressure to do so, It’s nice to tell them to thank you from time to time.Pexels.comThis page is very similar to Pixabay and contains many of the same images, though Pexels also contains videos and wallpapers. The images are free, even for commercial purposes, and it is not necessary to add a mapping or credit to use the images.Pexels also offers some interesting photo contests that can be fun to talk about, promoting the best images uploaded to your site.Wikimedia.orgThe WIki is a group dedicated to the opening up of the Internet. You can find images Wikimedia Commons known as creative commons, that is, they are usually free to use, but often require to have a loan or an appointment along with the image or picture.I found that this page is for more general things that are seen in our daily news, such as pictures of famous people or things in general, are useful as pictures of specific pathogens, or maybe antibiotics.However, you should check the rights offered for these images and make sure you add a title to your image with the credit or quote specified in the license.Unsplash.comThis is another page that has pictures and shares a shared library with Pixabay, although there are other pictures as well. It’s easy to navigate on this page because, if you enter a search term, for instance, Online Business, a series of tabs will appear at the top with different categories under the search term you sent. For example, you can get more subcategories like Technology, Laptop, and office.This page also encourages you to add a credit to an image you use to credit the photographer. Although not obligatory, it is appreciated as they say.Morguefile.comAs in previous pages, Morguefile describes itself as a free Creative, also by Creative photo library. You can upload and download images for free, and search similar to other sites that have requests for people doing the same thing to Pexels.com competitions.You can also access various Morguefile image sites from within, such as Shutterstock, Getty, Time, and Bigstock, among others, but the images will come up with a watermark, which will only be removed when you buy the image. However, this can save time by switching between different websites.KaboomPics.comThis is another useful page that offers free pictures. What I particularly like about this page is that you can as well download a free color palette based on the colors of the image. The color palette also gives you the HEX numbers of the colors so you can use them to keep your graphics or markers in the same colors.You can also easily view all photos in the same photo session, which is great if you’re creating a series of pictures or need other versions.3. Pay For Image Or Subscription WebsitesThere are several websites where you can pay for these pictures. These vary from sites that load per image to premium subscriptions for users who use more than 500 images per month. Since this publication mainly deals with pictures of free pictures or as they are popularly called “royalty-free images, I will not go into detail. Let me share the ones I have used below:Styled Stock SocietyIf you are a female blogger and you need some feminine stock images for your beautiful blog, I suggest you look at this site. You can join for free and get 10 FREE photos ( and new freebies every month). As their member, you will get the all-access library (over 700 images + 50 images added each month). or you can buy individual stock photo sets ( from $15 -$25).Adobe StockThis site is a pay-per-view site established by Adobe. it changed its very own name from Fotolia.com. You can pay for images from 10 images for $ 29.99 per month, but if you do not want to start a monthly plan, you can buy credits and use them to buy individual images or images and videos that are not included in the content plans. When you join, you can get 10 free pictures; otherwise, you have to pay.One of the good things about Adobe is that it is highly valued in the community of image creation and design. That’s why many designers use it and share big pictures and graphics online. It also has 3D models, lights, and materials, so if you are a graphic designer, you can find these useful elements to create your graphics.Because Adobe creates graphics software, you can also preview watermarked images in your projects, such as Photoshop, InDesign, or Illustrator, and then easily license images from those programs.They also have videos and templates that are useful to make creating graphics easier and faster and can be searched by categories as well as individual keywords.Ivory MixAnother great site for female online entrepreneurs and bloggers. As a FREE member, you will get more than 300 styled royalty-free stock photos for your blogs and websites. Also, you will get a lot of useful tips and monthly images and updates.ShutterstockThis is a great site with millions of images and more added every month. It’s great for very specific things you did not shoot and the quality of the pictures is usually high.They also contain a lot of cartoons, graphics, and vectors, which means that pictures can be easily adapted to your needs.Prices start at $ 19.00 per month for 10 pictures.Link → (https://www.shutterstock.com/)I hope this post was useful to you. Kindly leave a comment also.Remember, the images are important to your business to use a variety of websites and to make sure your blog is engaging. So, use the best royalty-free stock photos to apply in your blog and eye-catching your visitors.10 Must-Have Apps for Book LoversLove to read? You need these apps designed for bookworms.

React, Vue는 기본적으로 배포하는 방법이 상당히 유사하다. Yarn build 또는 npm run build를 진행해서 배포할 파일로 만들어 주자 (EC2나 EB — ElasticBeanstalk — 를 사용해 프론트 배포를 진행하는 것은 내가 아직 잘 모르기 때문에 추후에 정리해놓겠다.)파일이 형성되면 IDE 왼쪽 사이드 폴더 메뉴에 Build라는 폴더가 생성된 것을 볼 수 있다. 이 폴더가 곧 배포해서 사용될 폴더 내용물이다.해당 파일이 있는 폴더를 미리 열어놓고, AWS 콘솔로 넘어가서 로그인을 하자.S3 Console 내부 모습S3 콘솔창 내부로 들어오면, 기존에 배포한 버킷이 있을 것이고, 처음 AWS를 사용하는 사람들은 버킷이 단 하나도 없을 것이다. 버킷 생성하는 단계는 매우 간단하다.버킷이름은 사용할 도메인 이름과 동일하게 만든다. Region은 본인 선택에 따라 원하는 지역을 택한다.버킷을 생성할텐데, 배포할 서비스 도메인의 이름과 동일하게한다. 예를 들어 배포 도메인 이름을 ryankim.info라고 한다면 버킷 이름도 ryankim.info라고 해야한다 (추후에 Route 53에서 등록할 때 버킷 이름이 도메인과 맞지 않으면 등록이 안된다. 다른 도메인 호스팅 서비스 업체도 동일하게 적용되는지는 잘 모르겠다.)Configure Options는 스킵한다.Set permissions도 스킵한다.버킷을 생성한다.생성한 버킷이 잘 보이면, 만드는 것에 성공한 것이다 (버킷 만드는 게 어렵지는 않다)버킷 생성 후, Permission으로 넘어가서 권한 설정을 진행한다.Bucket Policy Access로 접근해서 버킷 접근 권한에 대해 퍼블릭 접근을 허용하게 만든다그 후, 버킷 정책 생성기를 사용해 버킷 정책을 생성한다 (버킷이 어떤 때에 움직일지 지정한다)Actions에는 GetObject를 선택한다Actions에는 GetObject를 선택하는데 그 이유는 사용자가 접근할 때마다 버킷의 내용물을 보여줄 수 있게 해줘야하기 때문이다 (Get + Object : S3는 버킷 내의 저장물을 Object로써 취급한다)버킷을 생성하면 결과값을 복사해서 이전 화면의 콘솔창에 복사 붙여넣기를 진행한다.여기서 별거 아니지만 놓치면 자료를 꽤 찾아봐야하는 설정이 있는데, Resource라는 JSON 값에 arn에 대한 값이 있다.예를 들어, “arn:aws:s3:::s3-bucket”이라 올리면 업로드가 거부되는 일이 있는데, 반드시 “arn:aws:s3:::s3-bucket/*”를 입력해서 버킷 내에 모든 값에 대해 접근할 수 있게 작성해줘야한다. (경로 문제가 있는 것 같다.)버킷이 생성되고 나서, yarn build로 생성한 배포 폴더를 업로드하면, (Build 폴더를 올리면 안되고, 폴더 경로 내부로 들어가서 내부에 있는 폴더들을 Drag & Drop으로 업로드 해주면 된다) S3 배포가 완료 되었다.그런데 배포하고 나면 문제가 있다.배포한 도메인의 이름이 일단 너무 길고, 이상하다 (AWS에서 랜덤으로 만든 값이 도메인으로 들어가 있다)도메인 첫 앞자리를 보면 http://라고 되어 있는 걸 볼 수 있는데, 우리가 이용하고 있는 많은 서비스들은 https라고 되어 있다. 즉, 배포하는 과정에서 추가적인 설정이 필요하다는 뜻이다.1번의 경우, 우리가 흔히 말하는 도메인을 구매해서 연결해줘야하고 (구매하는 행위와 구매한 도메인을 연결하는 것 모두 Route 53에서 진행한다)2번의 경우, 드디어 초반에 언급했던 Cloud Front라는 것을 써야하고, 그 전에 AWS Certificate Manager라는 것을 사용해서 인증서 발급을 진행해야 한다.가볍게 AWS Certificate Manager라는 것부터 시작해보자. (참고로 인증서 발급은 무료다. 이런 것도 돈 받아서 서비스 했다면 아마존이 상당히 부자가 되지 않았을까?)AWS Certificate Manager를 들어오면 아래와 같은 화면이 보일 것이다. (인증서 발급을 한 번도 안해본 사람들은 아래의 이미지처럼 이미 요청한 인증서가 없을 것이다.)여기서 request a certificate를 클릭하자.AWS Certificate Manager의 첫 모습그럼 다음 화면이 나오는데 여기서 public certificate를 클릭해서public certificate를 요청하는 과정이다.인증서를 적용할 도메인 이름을 지정한다(추후 Route53에서 사용할 도메인)여기가 조금 조심스러운 부분인데, 인증서를 적용할 도메인을 지정할 때, 앞 부분에 *.example.com처럼 앞단에 *를 지정할 수 있다. 이게 무슨 뜻이냐면 적용할 도메인에 여러가지 서비스가 있을 수 있는데, 관련 도메인에 모두 https를 적용할 수 있게 하겠다는 뜻이다.요즘 네이버나 관련 IT 서비스들을 보면 finance.naver.com 등 자회사 서비스들을 적용할 때 도메인 앞에 서비스 카테고리를 지정하는 것을 종종 본다. 이런 페이지들에 일일이 인증서를 적용할 수는 없으니 한번에 지정해주는 것이다.누가 설명을 안해주니 나도 찾아보면서 알게 된 자료들을 정리해본다.그 후, 인증서 발급을 위해 인증해줄 이메일이나 DNS를 적용한다.인증서의 인증을 위해 이메일 또는 사용할 서비스의 DNS (Domain Name Server)를 선택한다.이메일을 선택하면 aws 가입 당시 입력했던 이메일로 검증 메일이 갈 것이고, DNS 인증을 클릭하면 이미 발급해놓은 DNS에 인증서 검증이 들어간다. (Route 53 확인)이후 add tag는 넘어가고 최종 리뷰를 진행하면 인증서 발급이 완료된다.인증 절차를 반드시 마무리하면 처음 AWS Certificate Manager에서 보여준 것처럼 인증서가 승인되었다는 화면을 볼 수 있다.인증서 발급 끝!자, 대단원인 마지막이다. Cloud Front로 넘어가보자.아마 개발을 접한지 얼마 안된 분들이라면 Cloud Front가 어떤 서비스인지 많이 생소할 것이라고 생각한다. 나도 그랬고, 주변에서 많이 못들어봤던 서비스인데 (초심자니까…) 활용도가 매우 높은 AWS의 서비스다.이 서비스를 요약하면, 전 세계에 있는 아마존 서버 센터에 사용자들의 서비스를 캐시(cache)처럼 복사해놓고 빠른 서비스 사용을 돕는 취지로 사용되는 서비스다.CloudFront 서비스 설명우리는 이 서비스를 AWS Certificate Manager를 적용하는데 사용할 것이다.Cloud Front 메인 화면메인 화면에서 Create Distribution을 클릭하자 (나는 이미 배포되어 사용하고 있는 것이 있지만, 처음 접하는 분들은 아마 없을 것이다)웹에 인증서를 적용할 것이므로 Web을 클릭하자.하단의 설명을 참고하자Origin Domain Name : 우리가 배포했던 S3 도메인이 자동으로 나올 것이다. 그게 Origin Domain Name이다. 기존에 다른 배포 도메인이 있다면 함께 나온다.Origin Path : 지정한 경로에 있는 콘텐츠를 요청한다 (선택사항. 우리는 현재 사용하지 않는다)Origin ID : Origin Domain Name을 목록에서 선택하면 자동으로 설정된다.하단의 추가 설정 내용 1여기 이미지에서는 한 가지에 주목하면 되는데,Viewer Protocol Policy : Redirect Http to Https로 설정해서 혹시나 http로 접근하는 사람들이 있을 때 자동으로 https로 접근할 수 있게 변경을 도와준다.마지막이 제일 중요하다.마지막 설정 화면이 제일 중요한데 2가지를 주목하자.Alternate Domain Names : 사용자가 접근할 수 있을 것이라 판단되는 모든경로를 입력한다. 예를 들어 example.com을 배포한다면 www.example.com 을 함께 입력해서 같은 경로라는 것을 표기해주는 것이다. (해당 내용들은 Route 53에도 동일하게 적용된다)SSL Certificate : 우리가 AWS Certificate Manager에서 만들었던 인증서를 연결해주는 곳이다. Default 말고 Custom을 클릭하면 우리가 배포한 인증서가 나온다.이렇게 2개를 설정하고 배포한다.배포하는 시간이 대략 3분 정도 걸리고, 이후에 메인화면에 있는 Domain Name을 복사해서 도메인에 복사해 엔터를 누르면 Https가 적용된 웹사이트를 볼 수 있다.Cloud Front 메인에서 Domain Name을 복붙해서 크롬 도메인에 넣어보자.그런데 아직까지 도메인이 못생겼다. 다음 게시글에서는 Route 53에서 도메인 구매와 연결을 알아보자.AWS에서 정적 파일 배포와 인증서 연결을 하는 과정은 JS 프레임워크나 라이브러리에 공통적으로 적용되는 사항이다 보니, 사용하는 방법을 한 번 잘 알아두면 사용하기 매우 편리하다. 잘 기록해놓고, 추후에 또 활용하자.다음 게시글 목표Route 53 적용React.js EC2 배포해보기 (특히 EB)참고자료AWS S3, CloudFront 공식문서Ryan KorWritten byRyan KimData Engineering DeveloperFollow20 20 20 AWSDeploymentWeb DevelopmentReactJavaScriptMore from Ryan KimFollowData Engineering DeveloperMore From MediumSouth Korean Women Are Fighting to Take Off Their ‘Corsets’The Establishment in The EstablishmentDon’t Talk Trash About South Korea’s Waste Management SystemVincent AuCreating a YouTube ‘Latest Video Viewer’ with ReactJames Bubb in JavaScript In Plain EnglishImproving the Reactivity System (feat.

Authorization手很明顯是魔術師的手 Sleight of hand前面的幾支影片已經介紹了網路應用、類別、從瀏覽器到伺服器的流程、以及應用層的協定。KK 老師今天要來跟大家聊聊「權限」。（補充： 101 是美國用來辨識初級課程用的編碼，方便學生轉學時銜接課程）為什麼要聊權限呢？假設你有個會員系統，你會需要規範什麼樣的人可以做什麼樣的事情。KK 用網頁遊戲為例，你可能需要知道某個人擁有什麼樣的裝備、或是能不能使用管理員介面。如果是做課程平台，只有付費購買的會員才能夠觀看課程內容。權限有哪些模式？主要兩個，Client To Server 和 Server To Server。Client To Server 是什麼？Client 通常指的是使用者使用的平台或軟體，如：瀏覽器 （Browser）或是App。Client To Server 的驗證就是使用者透過 Client 端登入，獲取權限進入伺服器。資料傳給 Server常見的方式是，帳號（account）、密碼 （***）登入，會將資料傳給 Server （伺服器）。伺服器會跟資料庫（Database，縮寫為 DB）做驗證，跟 Client 端確定登入成功（或沒有）。Server 跟 DB 做驗證另外一個常見的模式是「第三方登入」，如：網頁上提供 Facebook 登入、Google 登入、GitHub 登入…等。此時 Facebook 會回傳一個 token 給伺服器，伺服器就會拿這個 token 去跟 Facebook 要他想要的資料，比較詳細的流程如下。第三方登入流程第一步，發 Scope第一步Client 端告訴第三方想要什麼資料（KK 說明這些請求為 Scope，找了一下這邊有補充說明）以 Facebook 為例，Client 端會先跟 Facebook 說要使用第三方登入。此時會跳出 Facebook 介面，讓使用者輸入帳號、密碼，並且選擇同意第三方提供哪些資訊給伺服器，如：姓名、電子郵件、生日…等。第二步，取 Token第二步伺服器取得權限（拿到 token）。當第三方登入確認你是本人（帳號、密碼輸入正確），就會發一個 token 給伺服器，裡面包含了 Scope 說明使用者同意分享哪些資料。第三步，拿資料第三步伺服器透過 token 取得資料。總之，從 Client 端透過某些方法跟 Server 端驗證，我們就統稱為 Client To Server 模式。Server To Server 是什麼？Server To Server如字面上意思，是伺服器端直接對伺服器端做對接，如：網站的金流、物流等第三方服務。剛剛已經看過瀏覽器 Client 端對 Server 端，而 Server 端再對 Server 端這個就是 Server To Server 。權限驗證上通常 Server To Server 會比 Client To Server 容易實作，因為這些操作都會在「防火牆」內，能夠建立「白名單」來限制哪些 IP 或 Port 可以使用。Server To Server 常見的有用固定的字串或非對稱加密（公鑰、私鑰）的方式實作，相對 Client To Server 方式少很多。為什麼呢？KK 老師說，只要接觸人（Client）的地方都很可怕。容易搞錯的兩個詞 Authentication 和 AuthorizationAuthentication 和 AuthorizationAuthentication（驗證）：你告訴我密碼是什麼，我告訴你對或不對。KK 舉例：進入校園一定要學生證，只要你拿著學生證，就能進入校園。Authorization （授權）：講的是有權限做到什麼程度。KK 舉例：有學生證進入校園，卻不能進入某個辦公室。得到驗證進入，但沒有權限。Authentication 講的是對或錯，Authorization 講的是 level 到哪裡。09 成為看起來很強的後端：HTTP 狀態碼各種 HTTP Status Code接下來談 HTTP Status Code。1xx 的暫且不討論，用的地方比較少。2xx 的通常視為「成功請求」，如：200 是 OK 、 201 是 Created、204 是 No Content。3xx 的是跟導向有關的「轉址」。4xx 的是「Client 端的錯誤」，如：404 是 Not Found。5xx 的是「Server 端的錯誤」。而跟權限驗證比較有關的是 401 的 Unauthorized 和 403 的 Forbidden。KK 舉例來說，如果今天去一個網頁，沒有登入但存取一個需要登入才能觀看的網頁。這就像沒有帶學生證想進校園，會驗證不過並回傳 401 Unauthorized 。如果是有登入的情形下，到達一個需要是管理員才能觀看的網頁，而你只是一個會員。此時就會回傳 403 Forbidden 。補充：至於為什麼 401 的 Unauthorised 是 Authentication （驗證）問題，剛找到這篇解釋滿清楚的。簡單說 ，1999 寫 HTTP 規格書 RFC 2616 時，Authentication 和 Authorization 兩者經常通用。之後 OAtuth 的規範才比較明確去定義 401 用在 Unauthorised 的情形，以便於讓使用者明白究竟是要再次驗證（回傳 401 時）還是要告知使用者沒有權限（回傳 403 時）。再來就是 5xx 系列。常聽到的有：500 是 Server Error。此時 Reverse Proxy 會回傳這樣的錯誤，讓使用者知道伺服器有問題。502 是 Bad Gateway，代表 Reverse Proxy 跟 Web Server 斷掉了，也可能是 DNS 連不到 Reverse Proxy。504 是 Timeout，伺服器回應太慢，通常是超過 30 秒。10 成為看起來很強的後端：Token 類型KK 再來解釋什麼是 Token。中文翻譯為「權杖」、「令牌」，可以想成是學生證，用來通關用。通常有三種型態，分別為 Event-based 、Time-based 、 Static 。Event-based 是什麼？代表是被一個事件觸發，通常是一次性的，我們稱之為 OTP (one-time password) 。KK 舉例，使用網路銀行的時候，如果點選「轉帳」，此時會寄送一個驗證簡訊給使用者。這就是一個觸發事件。Time-based 是什麼？一般聽到講 token 指的是一個 Time-based 的 token。舉例來說，如果你在登入時點「忘記密碼」，你的信箱會收到一封有重置密碼連結的信件，上面註明「此連結在x小時內有效」。Static 是什麼？自己設定、不會變的，就是一般的 Password 這種。常聽到的有 JWT (JSON Web Tokens) 、 Cookies 、 Session 、 OAuth 、 API Key 、Basic Authentication…等。後面章節會把常見的權限驗證方式，根據這裡的分類做更詳細討論。11 成為看起來很強的後端：雜湊 Hash立刻進入主題，雜湊（Hash）、編碼（Encode）、加密（Encrypt）。這三個觀念會影響到後面學習密碼認證、Token認證、OTP、JWT…等等。雜湊（Hash）是什麼？很雜的雜、湊合的湊。把原本的一份資料（圖或字），透過某個 Hash Function （哈希表、哈希函式），變成一個新的東西（雜湊後的值）。用 Hash Function 變魔術一般來說，經過雜湊後的值，無法推回原始資料。原則上是單向的轉換，還原的困難度視雜湊的方式而有差異。常見的雜湊如： MD5 、 SHA256、SHA512。目前 MD5 已經被視為太簡單，容易透過「查表」的方式還原。（例如使用 Rainbow table 這種表）之後討論資安的課程，KK 老師會補充為什麼需要用其他方式去輔助雜湊。12 成為看起來很強的後端：編碼 EncodeEncode 過去編碼（Encode）是什麼？這是屬於雙向的轉換，例如各種語言的轉換（中文轉英文、德文轉日文…等）。因此編碼的特性是可以過去，也可以回來。Decode 回來為什麼需要做編碼這樣的東西？瀏覽器上我們可能想要呈現一張圖，而存在資料庫的時候或存成文字的時候，需要不同的編碼方式。例如我們可以透過 Base64 的編碼方式，把任何檔案變成用 a-z, 0–9, +, = 所組成的字串。常用情境在大頭貼，在網頁載入的時候，用 Base64 轉為字串，加快載入速度。KK 說，基本上只要最後面看到 = 的字串，很可能是 Base64 的編碼方式。另外一個常見的是16進制的 Hex 編碼，使用 a-f, 0–9 所組成的字串。常用 Base64 的原因，是因為他的壓縮率比較高，什麼意思呢？同樣一張圖，如果使用 Hex 轉換，就會產出一個超長的字串，而 Base64 會比較短。疑，影片結束了。13 成為看起來很強的後端：加密 Encrypt加密就跟腳踏車上鎖、解鎖一樣，可以加密（Encrypt）和解密（Decrypt） 資料。跟雜湊、編碼不同，加密需要有鑰匙。加密鑰匙又分兩種。第一種是加密、解密都只有一把鑰匙，我們稱為「對稱式」加密。常見的有 AES 演算法。第二種是加密、解密有兩把鑰匙，我們稱為「非對稱式」加密。後面的章節會談到 SSL 機制，加密都用公鑰，解密使用私鑰。這樣的機制讓我們能把公鑰放在網路上，有任何想要發加密的訊息給我，用公鑰就能加密。而全世界擁有我這把私鑰的人，才能解開這個訊息。14 成為看起來很強的後端：如何儲存密碼KK 老師這段分享密碼要如何儲存在資料庫裡面。快速複習一下三個觀念的特性。雜湊（Hash）的轉換是單向的。編碼（Encode）的轉換是雙向的。加密（Encrypt）的轉換是雙向而且需要鑰匙。能用編碼（Encode）儲存密碼嗎？假設我們有帳號 kk 、 密碼 kk123 （老師特別強調這不是他的真實密碼）。這時候把 kk123 先用 Base64 做編碼，得到某個字串XXX，再把字串XXX存到資料庫裡。這個做法相對不安全，工程師只需要進入 DB 把 XXX Decode 就能得到 kk123。進入 DB 就能取得密碼那能用加密（Encrypt）儲存密碼嗎？此時我們假設用 AES 加密演算法 Encrypt，需要帶一把 Key 放到 DB 裡面。而後端工程師一樣有你的 Key ，自然能從 DB 拿回來 Decrypt 回來。如果能看到整個資料庫所有會員的密碼，那後端工程師就能加以利用。因此，雙向的編碼（Encode）、加密（Encrypt），都會有這樣的問題。看來用 AES 加密也不行那單向的雜湊（Hash）呢？我們用一樣的方式雜湊一個 XXX，忘記密碼的時候，工程師也會跟你說，他沒辦法幫你。這時候你會得到一個新的連結，重新產生一組密碼。而我們重新產生的時候，常常會被告知「密碼不能與上個密碼重複」，是不是密碼被記住了嗎？此時是因為同樣的密碼會產出相同的 Hash 值，而系統有存之前密碼的 Hash 值。可是雜湊（Hash）不是會被破解嗎？Hash 加一點點 Salt此時我們就會在密碼的前方加上一點 Salt （補充），如圖中圈起的 abc。這樣雜湊的結果用表反查也比較難知道我們的 Salt 到底是加了什麼。但這樣還是有可能被破解，因此會在用一個 bcrypt （補充）的方式，重複 Hash 幾次。次數越多將會影響登入的速度，同時增加破解的困難度。KK再次強調：沒有破解不了的系統，只有讓破解成本越高，降低破解方的動機。（非原文，我的個人解讀）KK 加油！有興趣請直接去 Web 實驗室的 Youtube 跟 Facebook

Today dozens of Google engineers use Python, and we’re looking for more people with skills in this language.”-Peter Norvig-Installation and Setup of Python Flasksrc:https://images.app.goo.gl/TcQ1mTiJbCeADnYDAFlask does not come with the default Python Installation. You need to install Flask. Flask depends on Jinja Template Engine and the Werkzeug WSGI toolkit. You need to install python 3 into your computer. You need to install pip. It helps to install libraries to the Computer.You need to create a separate file for the Flask Project. You need to open the file From the Command Prompt to create a Virtual Environment.Create Virtual Environment:python3 -m venv envThen Type:py -m venv envAfter the creation of the virtual environment, You need to activate the Virtual Environment.Activate Virtual Environment in Windows:env\Scripts\activateAfter these steps, you can see the name of the virtual environment on the command prompt inside the braces.After these steps then you can install flask into the computer.Install Flask:pip install flaskThen you need to select the python to execute in the FlaskSetting up the Python file to the Flask:set FLASK_APP=(file name .py)Then you can run the Flask App:flask runThe Flask app runs on the http://127.0.0.1/5000 address. You can copy this address and paste on the Browser to go to the app. You can activate debug feature on the Flask which helps to automatic reloading feature with the Update.Activate Debug:set FLASK_DEBUG=1Then you need to rerun the Flask app. You can see that debug mode is on after activating the debug mode.You can add pre-created templates to the Flask. You need to create two separate folders inside the project called templates and scripts. HTML Files should put into the templates folder. CSS, JavaScript files should put into the scripts folder. Then the routing should be done in the python file using render_template method.There are many Web Development Libraries to choose from. So you can choose the suitable library according to your Preference. But Flask is a good choice. I think you got a clear idea about Flask and main Configurations on Flask By reading this article. Having A good Knowledge About Web Development Libraries will Help you when Selecting suitable Frameworks For the Projects.I like to Thank You For Reading My Article.

Modifying a Project to Become Responsive With Media Queries,https://medium.com/dev-genius/modifying-a-project-to-become-responsive-with-media-queries-e555971d4098?source=tag_archive---------28-----------------------,"Responsive Design,Web Development,Media Queries,CSS,Software Development","Lately, I have been spending a lot of time on a side project of mine called Funky Cafe. The gist of the app is simple. It allows my wife and I to select meals from a list of our favorite meals, then we selects sides for those meals, and it spits out a printable page of ingredients on the final screen.Take a look:Not too bad!I know, I know, always design for mobile first. I see and hear that a lot, but I didn’t listen and now I want to make my website look good on every screen size. I’ve been developing and styling Funky Cafe entirely based on a full screen rendering of the app, which is a pretty good user experience in full screen on a desktop or laptop. However, when I start reducing the screen size, we can start to see problems arise.Here is what Funky Cafe would look like if it were opened on a mobile device.Not too good!We can see the styling doesn’t change, but that’s the issue. The styling I applied to the desktop version just doesn’t translate as well to smaller screens. I used pixels when designating sizes for different elements, so my elements are naturally way too large for the screen.So what can we do?Use a media query breakpoint!I will be demonstrating how to use media queries by modifying my non responsive app Funky Cafe so it will look good even if it’s opened on a mobile device. This post will be a look into my thought process when trying to translate a desktop web app to mobile browser size (truthfully, it’s mostly CSS tinkering). We’ll get the header and navigation to fit better, and then also address the “Meals” tab shown in the images above.I read that the most common screen sizes to design for are 320px (mobile), 768px (tablet), and 1200px (laptop). By modifying Funky Cafe for mobile, it will demonstrate the core principles necessary for tablet.If you would like to see the structure of the app as you read along, here is the Github repository. Let’s do some planning before we get started.Opening BrainstormingHere are the things I feel will need to be addressed:— Everything needs to be resized, the breakpoint (screen width) we’ll use is 320px, so everything needs to fit well within that small space.— Orientation will need to change for a lot of elements. For example, we’ll move the ingredients list for each meal below the image, and we’ll make all the meals flow into one column instead of two.I think after modifying the app with these two points in mind, we’ll have a much better looking design for mobile, and we’ll be on our way to making Funky Cafe responsive.HeaderStarting with the very top, we will set our header with a class name of app-header which contains the title, navigation, and reset button to have a max-width: 320px. Then we need to get our title smaller, and make our navigation tabs fit better.Here’s what the media query itself will look like. We need to put all of our mobile styling inside of it in order for it to only be used when the screen size is 320px or less:@media only screen and (max-width: 320px) {  }This allows us to change our styling for small devices, but keep our original styling for our larger devices. Let’s get started by simply making the header fit the screen and see what we get:@media only screen and (max-width: 320px) {  .app-header {    max-width: 320px;  }}We made it change! Now we can see all the elements of the header, they are just incredibly large, and smashed together! Let’s achieve our next goal by modifying the title:@media only screen and (max-width: 320px) {  .app-header {    max-width: 320px;  }  .title, .letter-f-and-c {    font-size: 28px;  }}The top section of the header is shaping up after reducing the size of the title.Let’s talk about something I found to be important with media queries. If you do not put your media query at the bottom of your stylesheet, you will run into a weird issue with setting some properties, for me it was font-size. I went down a rabbit hole where I eventually solved my issue by adding the keyword !important after the value I gave for font-size.I’ve read that !important is bad practice, I’ve also read it’s not so bad. In the name of not demonstrating bad practice, we won’t use !important. Luckily, I found a comment someone wrote about media queries needing to be at the bottom of stylesheets, once I did that, I didn’t need any magic keywords at all.NavigationMoving right along, the next section that looks like it needs help is the navigation bar, so I’ll move to that stylesheet and adjust things by making the text smaller, then reducing the height of each tab, and adding some padding to show a little orange above and below the tabs:@media only screen and (max-width: 320px) {  .navbar-h1 {    font-size: 16px;    margin: 0px;  }  .navbar-li {    height: 50px;  }  .navbar-ul {    padding-top: 5px;    padding-bottom: 5px;  }}Things are shaping up already! Let’s move on to the lower body section and finish up this demonstration!Body SectionI think a good first step here would be to make all the meal boxes appear in one column. I will also change the size of the “Pick Your Meals!” text, and reduce the margin between it and the header/navigation. After moving to the correct stylesheet:@media only screen and (max-width: 320px) {  .meal-boxes-div {    display: flex;    flex-direction: column;  }  .meal-page-h1 {    font-size: 24px;    margin: 125px 0px 10px 0px;     //previously 195px 0px 10px 0px;  }}This leads us into our final steps, reducing the size of the meal names, preventing ingredients from wrapping, and moving the ingredients list underneath the images:@media only screen and (max-width: 320px) {  .meal-name-h2 {    font-size: 30px;  }  .img-and-ingredients {    flex-direction: column;    margin: 8px 10px 0px 10px;  }.ingredients-ul {    flex-wrap: nowrap;    height: auto; //height changes with amount of ingredients    margin-bottom: 0px;  }}That sums up the issues I see with this page! Everything actually fits on the screen properly! Here is a GIF of the finished result in action:Final NotesNow, something I want to mention is that I used max-width: 320px for the mobile screen breakpoint, but if I wanted to make a breakpoint for tablets, and I used max-width: 768px, we would see the styling for tablets show up even if the screen size was 300px. Why? Because 300px is not only less than our mobile breakpoint, but now it would also be less than 768px for the tablet breakpoint, so the tablet styling applies.How to avoid this:Instead of using max-width in the media query, if we use min-width and set the value to what we want the smallest possible screen to be for that styling version instead of the largest, we can avoid the confusing pitfalls involved with using max-width for every breakpoint.Example:@media only screen and (max-width: 320px) {  //styling for small mobile devices (what we just did)}@media only screen and (min-width: 321px) {  //styling for medium to large mobile devices}@media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {  //styling for tablets }@media only screen and (min-width: 1200px) {  //styling for laptops and larger}ConclusionAt this point, I think we have sufficiently shown media queries are a simple way to make your web app fit multiple sizes of devices, and maybe it will inspire you to transform your old non-responsive app into something worth opening on a mobile device or tablet.While I realize a lot of this article is specifically about how to style my app, Funky Cafe, my goal was to provide educational value by explaining my thought process while turning a web app responsive, start to finish.Hopefully this was insightful, and per usual, happy hacking!Dev GeniusCoding, Tutorials, News, UX, UI and much more related to developmentFollow35 Sign up for Best StoriesBy Dev GeniusThe best stories sent monthly to your email. Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

Setting Up Redux for Your React App,https://medium.com/swlh/setting-up-redux-for-your-react-app-51c9cadcd87e?source=tag_archive---------29-----------------------,"React,Redux,Store,Web Development,React Redux","What is Redux?Okay, so this is the first question that has to be answered when you are considering redux for your app. So redux is a state(data that your application needs) management library. Basically react is used when you need to share some data throughout the application and if your application follows the flux architecture (in which data flows only in one flow normally from parent to child in most applications). So why would you be considering this? well, there are many reasons. Some of those can be as follows:You want some data to be shared your application which is on the same levels or not on the same level. The Most Common Used case is logging in your user. Suppose you have a component and you want that when user logins it should change the navbar behavior.You are fed up using callbacks to trigger a change in some components.You see how having state management can make managing your application more manageable.so above are some reasons why I use redux in my projects but you might have some other reason. There are endless cases in which redux can be useful in react.Redux terms you should knowStore: First-term that you will hear once you get into redux and frankly it’s nothing more than a fancy way of having a local DB that is accessible to your application. And mainly the data which is shared by many components is present here.Reducer: Another Scary term that scares the hell out of me till now but it’s not more than the SQL for your store. In reducer you write the query that will mutate your store like in a DB you will use some queries to mutate the DB here you will use reducers to mutate your store.Dispatcher: This is a tricky one to explain but I’ll try. You write a SQL query for your DB but how will you execute it you need some SQL console to execute it right? The dispatcher does the same thing it executes the reducer to your store.Okay, that are all the terms you need for implementing and understanding redux.So in summary DISPATCHER triggers a REDUCER that mutates the STORE.Okay enough talking let’s code.REACT AND REDUXOkay, so we’ll tackle this problem step by step.Make A Store.Make A Reducer.Make A dispatcher.Note: For installation of redux and react-redux run below commandnpm i redux react-reduxyarn add redux react-reduxMaking a StoreFrankly speaking, it’s the easiest part of the whole process.//index.js//importsimport { Provider } from ""react-redux"";import { createStore } from ""redux"";import reducer from './reducers/file-having-reducer';//storelet store = createStore(reducer);const rootElement = document.getElementById(""root"");ReactDOM.render(<React.StrictMode>  <Provider store={store}>    <App />  </Provider></React.StrictMode>,rootElement);Making a ReducerNow let’s make a reducer. Ok, so what is a reducer? reducer is nothing it’s just like a function that takes 2 arguments state and action. State argument is taken care of by redux and we don’t have to do anything regarding that but action is an object that is sent by us which has two things one is the type and the other is the payload. The type will define the case which will run in switch and payload is the data that you may want to give for manipulation of state. When a particular case had run you should return a newly updated state.//structure of actionaction = {type:'ANY_ACTION_DUE_TO_WHICH_IT_WILL_RUN_PARTICULAR_ACTION',payload:{         data:data         }}//file-containing-reducerconst initialState = 0;function reducer(state=initialState,action){    switch(action.type){    case 'ADD' : return state + 1;    case 'SUBTRACT' : return state - 1;    case 'UPDATE' : return action.payload;    default : return state;    }}export default reducer;Making A DispatcherOkay, this part is a little difficult so just bear with me.//dispatcher.jsexport const addToState = () => ({ type: 'ADD' });export const subtractFromProps = () => ({ type: 'SUBTRACT' });export const update = (data) => ({ type: 'UPDATE', payload: data });Above are dispatcher these are nothing just function returning some objectsNow we are ready to integrate redux in our application.So for connecting our store and our dispatcher to themselves we have to use connect that we will import from react-redux. Now, what will connect do it will take 2 functions as arguments the first function will map store data to props and the second will map dispatch, and then it will return us a function to which we’ll give our component i.e. App as an argument and the rest will be taken care by redux.//App.jsimport React from ""react"";import { connect } from ""react-redux"";import { addToState, subtractFromState, update} from ""./dispatchers/dispatcher"";import ""./styles.css"";function App(props) { return (<div className=""App""><h1>Count : {props.count}</h1><button onClick={() => props.add()}>ADD</button><button onClick={() => props.update(Math.random())}>UPDATE</button><button onClick={() => props.subtract()}>SUBTRACT</button></div>);}const mapStateToProps = (state) => { return {  count: state };};const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => { return {  add: () => dispatch(addToState()),  update: (data) => dispatch(update(data)),  subtract: () => dispatch(subtractFromState()) };};export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(App);And we are done. And in the same way, we can attach dispatchers and store data to other components.I won’t lie you won’t get it the first time you will have to play around to get it but once you get it there’s no way you will be back to using state only.Below is the working example:Below is more of a complex example and will help you to understand more about how the redux can be more of useNOTE: There will be some issues you will encounter when working with objects in the store. That of components not updating on state change that is because changes will only be triggered if react finds a different object so whenever we return state from reducer we return a whole new object in order to counter this problem. If you still want more clarification go on youtube or ping me on LinkedIn. I’ll be more than happy to help.The StartupMedium's largest active publication, followed by +723K people.

Maintainable JavaScript — Functions and Arrays,https://medium.com/dev-genius/maintainable-javascript-functions-and-arrays-b1d4a47cb46b?source=tag_archive---------30-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Louis Hansel @shotsoflouis on UnsplashCreating maintainable JavaScript code is important if want to keep using the code.In this article, we’ll look at the basics of creating maintainable JavaScript code by looking at how to check for functions, arrays, and bad ways to check for object properties.Detecting FunctionsFunctions are reference types in JavaScript.They’re created from the Function constructor of which each function is an instance.There’s a bad way to check for a function.We shouldn’t check for functions with the instanceof operator.For instance, we shouldn’t write:function func() {}console.log(func instanceof Function);to check for a function.This isn’t good because it doesn’t work across frames since each frame have their own Function instance.Instead, we should use the typeof operator.So we should write:function func() {}console.log(typeof func === 'function');typeof works across all frames.Only IE8 or earlier have limitations with this, so we don’t have to worry about it.Detecting ArraysArrays are also objects, so we can check for arrays with the instanceof operator.For instance, we can write:arr instanceof ArrayBut like any other uses of the instanceof operator, it won’t work across frames.Another way that was recommended by Douglas Crockford was to check for array methods.For instance, we can write;function isArray(value) {  return typeof value.sort === ""function"";}to check whether the sort method exists in the value object.But anything can have the sort method so it’s probably not very accurate.Another suggestion is to call the toString method on the value to see if it returns '[object Array]' .So we can write:function isArray(value) {  return Object.prototype.toString.call(value) === ""[object Array]"";}This works across all frames and only arrays return this string, so this can be used to check for array.However, now there’s a built-in way to check for arrays with the Array.isArray method.For instance, we can write:function isArray(value) {  if (typeof Array.isArray === ""function"") {    return Array.isArray(value);  } else {    return Object.prototype.toString.call(value) === ""[object Array]"";  }}We check if Array.isArray exists by checking whether it’s a function.Then we can call it to check if it’s an array.Array.isArray works across all frames, so we can use it to check for arrays anywhere.This is implemented in IE9, Firefox 4+, Chrome, Opera 10.5+, and Safari 5+.This means that we can just use Array.isArray and forget about everything else.Bad Ways of Detecting PropertiesDetecting properties is another tricky issue we may run into.There are a few bad ways to check for properties in an object.They include:if (object[propertyName]) {  //...}if (object[propertyName] != null) {  //...}if (object[propertyName] != undefined) {  //...}All of them check for all falsy values, so they won’t work well for our needs.Falsy values include 0, null , undefined , '' (empty string)m and false .So those expressions will all be true if objec[propertyName] is any of those values.Photo by Jen Theodore on UnsplashConclusionWe can check for arrays with Array.isArray .And we shouldn’t check for all falsy values to check if an object property exists.We can detect functions with the typeof operator.Dev GeniusCoding, Tutorials, News, UX, UI and much more related to developmentFollow18 Sign up for Best StoriesBy Dev GeniusThe best stories sent monthly to your email. Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

5 must-have chrome extensions for designers,https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/5-must-have-chrome-extensions-for-designers-500a4c5a8840?source=tag_archive---------32-----------------------,"Web Development,Design,UI,UX,Design Tools","Google Chrome is arguably the most powerful and widely used browser in the World. Many professionals and casual users prefer Chrome over Microsoft’s Edge and such. So, naturally, designers around the world prefer Chrome for their efficiency, speed, and usability.Chrome’s Extensions support has always been a staple for years in almost every way. But it’s quite troublesome to find those useful extensions. To reduce your stress, I’ve compiled 5 best and useful chrome extensions for you.Eye DropperEye Dropper Extension InterfaceEye Dropper, an open-source Chromium extension for almost every chromium-based browsers like Chrome and the new Microsoft Edge. It allows you to pick colors from every web page you can think of. The extension gives you two options to choose, Pick from the web page, and mix your own color.Pick from the web page option allows you to move the cursor anywhere on the web page to pick a color. It also has an integrated color picker. You can also save the color's hex code to view it later. There are many other color picker extensions available but this one, in particular, hits the sweet spot between color accuracy and website support.What FontDribbble’s Font and it’s infoIt basically does what it says. ‘What Font’ is your tool if you want to find out what font a website is using. All you need to do is to click the extension and hover over the font with the cursor which you want to find out. The extension neatly presents with precise detail about the font like font family, size, height, and the color hex of the typeface.SpectrumIt is always the best thing to test your website before going online. One such thing now more than ever every web designer should test their website for Color Vision Deficiency. As people will be unable to distinguish between a few colors when suffering from it.With Spectrum, you can quickly test your website for different types of Color Vision Deficiency or Color Blindness. A simple and straight forward extension especially for UI/UX developers. It also works with local files or sites by default.Resolution TestResolution test is an extension for developers to test web pages in different resolutions. By default, the extension comes with popularly used screen resolutions using which developers can preview their websites right in the browser. It also gives you the option to add your own resolutions.WhatRunsWhatRuns Medium.comWhatRuns allows you to discover what runs a website. It shows you almost everything that runs a website like CMS, CDN, plugins, and more. It shows you how a website tracks its visitors, web apps they pay for. It also shows you the WordPress plugins and fonts.It also allows you to follow your favorite websites so that you can get informed whenever a particular website updates it’s designing or adopts new technology tools.Other extensions like Dimensions which allow designers to measure screen dimensions with a mouse cursor, Site Palette which helps in generating color palettes from web pages, and Style Bot which allows you to manipulate the appearance of any website.All the mentioned extensions work on almost every chromium-based browser. I hope you found something useful. Let me know your favorite Chrome extensions.

Amazon Prime video UX critique,https://medium.com/@bhagyash.ingale/amazon-prime-video-ux-critique-da432e87719d?source=tag_archive---------33-----------------------,"UX Design,UI,Amazon,Web Development,User Experience","The hero / cover ImageOne of the most important prime visual real estate of a web app. Utterly wasted. It makes no sense to add a question asking the users mood. The worse are the suggestions. Poor naming skills, family chills? Rib tickling? What happens if my mood is none of them? It’s a disaster. The bleeding colours on the label text is a poorly executed style. Especially with this font.When I clicked each of those labels I was redirected to the same page. Which makes this feature even more redundant. I at the very least expected these as filters to match my limited mood choices.This hero image is a carousel which keeps shifting images. Here’s what I saw next.It looks like prime video is collecting whitespace for future use. I don’t understand why the bottom space was left out. They should’ve increased the font-size of the description for better readability. The horizontal spacing is also way too high. The clip could’ve been enlarged, zoomed in or cropped making room for more elements.Basic layout is not optimised.The cover image shows too little information while the main content is compromised. Netflix has a larger cover image which comprises about 80–90% of the page. Which is like a hard selling salesman. Overly suggestive. Not against large cover images/ clips. But too large is never good. I would prefer columns suggesting more options.Unwanted regional show suggestionsI’m zero percent interested in watching regional shows. I never watch any, yet the algorithm keeps pushing regional content. It’s like one of the most basic filters for a viewer based on the geography/ language preference of a user.Hover AnimationIt’s good that the element transitions on top when hovered. But the animation is so jerky. I mean it’s so easy to add like a smoother animation timing. Even noobs can add an easing timing. I would definitely add my own custom bezier animation curves. It’s takes one line of code in CSS. LOL to your overly paid frontend engineers.HATE these sub-regional bs.I can’t stand these regional recommendations. Hurts my eyes. Why can’t they understand, this ain’t my vibe.A feature I likedLike the big bold typography. The image is not eating up a bunch of space and is informative and building up excitement.The episode rewindOne of the worst features of amazon prime is that when you shut an episode after it’s almost finished, the next time you open, it replays the same episode. I checked this out on Netflix and it understands this and plays the next episode. People with a goldfish memory end up watching the same episode again. Many times i’ve been 5 mins into the episode and was like, didn’t I watch this last week?Saved the worst for the lastLiterally eye cancer. The three transparent icons slammed at your face. It’s like they wrap a blindfold on you with these eye-piercing things. I can’t stand them. They also darken the background to further deteriorate the viewing experience.Ending notesSorry , I feel like I’ve been very negative but I mean good and this is purely constructive criticism. No personal agendas, just my experience. Amazon has terrible UI except on Twitch and the old IMDB both of which they acquired.Been a pleasure.Written bybhagyash ingaleFollowUX DesignUIAmazonWeb DevelopmentUser ExperienceMore from bhagyash ingaleFollowMore From MediumPlaying With GradientsSaeid Azizi in The StartupContrarian Design Truths of StartupsUday Gajendar in The Designer’s SpeakeasyDesign a Journey for Better Product FeedbacksHieu Nguyen (Jack) in The StartupGuide to Designing, Developing and Delivering Online Learning ExperiencesLee Ackerman in digit-LYou don’t have to be a designer to use design thinkingKenneth Wayman in Greatest Possible GoodDesign [_____]?Karl Mochel in The StartupDesigning digital products for bioinformatics — Part IAntonio SolanoPeeling Back the Curtain on Digital MuralsAndrea Mejia-Madriz in Closer&CloserAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Frustrations with Node.js,https://medium.com/@KasraKhosravi/frustrations-with-node-js-95093ef43842?source=tag_archive---------34-----------------------,"Nodejs,JavaScript,Programming,Web Development,NPM","Source: https://railsware.comNodeJS is a powerful tool with an ability to solve I/O scaling issues and power full-stack JavaScript development, but it still has some quirks. We will discuss some of them in this article.Post originally published on LogRocket blogIntroductionJust to clarify, I don’t hate Node.js. I actually like Node.js and enjoy being a full-stack JavaScript developer. However, it does not mean I do not get frustrated by it. Before I get into some frustrations with Node.js, let me say some of the things Node.js is awesome at:It is awesome at solving the I/O scaling issueIt can power real-time applications easier and more powerfullyIt allows you to share your JavaScript knowledge from the client in the backend/server work as wellHowever, there are some quirks about Node.js you should know:Type checking — Node.js inherits the dynamic type checking from JavaScript. But, sometimes writing Node.js code in a real-life application makes you wish for stricter type checking to catch bugs sooner. You might have used one of the static type checking tools like Flow or TypeScript, but Flow frustrates a lot of developers with performance, compatibility, and IntelliSense issues, and TypeScript, despite its appeal in the community, tends to be heavy and can cause issues in places you never imaginedDebugging — I am not an expert on this but I always had issues with properly debugging my Node.js applications. I am not saying debugging is not supported or possible, but code inspections and breakpoints tend to be ignored from time to time and you can get frustrated with lack of support on this important task, compared to other frameworks. I usually end up placing console.log and debugger statements all over my code for this purpose, which is not idealThe above pain points are not limited to Node.js by any means. However, in my experience with Node.js as of today, I came to have two prominent frustrations that I think need to be clarified in more detail. Please also comment if you felt similar or additional frustrations with Node.js and how you manage to cope with them.Error handlingSource: https://unsplash.com/FrustrationThrowing errors in Node.js is not as straightforward as other languages (and frameworks). We have a lot of asynchronous code in Node.js and it requires you to pass the error in your callbacks and promises, instead of throwing exceptions or simply using try/catch blocks. Debugging the true nature of the error becomes much more difficult when you have to go a few callbacks deep or cannot figure out how an unhandled exception can cause your app to silently fail, and it is then when you wish for a smoother error handling process.BackgroundBefore diving into error handling, we need to define some basics.Node.js is built on top of JavaScript which is a single thread language. You get something called a call stack when having function calls. If any of your function calls take time to get resolved, we have to block the whole thread while we are waiting for the result to come back, which is not ideal in scenarios when we have to interact with a web application in browsers. The user still wants to work with the app, while we are waiting for some data to come back to us.Here is where we get to the concept of asynchronous JavaScript, which helps us handle the blocking code. Put simply, this is a mechanism to assign a callback to be performed when your registered function call is resolved. There are few options to handle this:Using function callback — the idea is simple. You pass a function called callback to your async function call. When the result of the async function call comes back, we trigger the callback. A good example of this is the async addEventListener which takes a callback as the second parameter:function clickHandler {  alert('Button is clicked');}btn.addEventListener('click', clickHandler);Using promise — when using a promise on async function, you get an object representing the state of the operation. We don’t know when the promise will come back to us with either a result or error, but we have the mechanism to handle either scenario. For example, calling node-fetch would generate a promise object which we can handle with its methods:const fetch = require(""node-fetch"");fetch(""https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1"")  .then(res => res.json())  .then(json => console.log(json))  .catch(error => console.log(""error"", error));// { userId: 1, id: 1, title: 'delectus aut autem', completed: false }We have other options like async iterators and generators or new async/await feature in ES2017 which is just syntactic sugar on top of the promise. But for simplicity, we just stick with the above options. Let’s see how error handling is maintained for both callbacks and promises.Asynchronous error handlingSource: https://unsplash.com/Function callback — error handling with this approach is done using a Error First Callback method. When the async function gets back with a result, the callback gets called with an Error Object as its first argument. If we have no error, this will be set as null. Let’s look at an example:// setTimeout is faking an async call which returns an error after 0.5 secondsconst asyncFunction = (callback) => {  setTimeout(() => {    callback(new Error('I got an error'))  }, 500)}// callback for our async functionconst callbackFunction = (err, data) => {  if (err) {    console.error(err);    return;  }  console.log(data);}asyncFunction(callbackFunction);When we call asyncFunction above, it approaches setTimeout as the first thing and cannot handle it synchronously. Therefore, it asks window API to resolve it and continues the program. When the result comes back (which in this case is an Error Object), it will call the function callback. Here come the frustrating parts.We cannot use a try/catch in the context of asynchronous function calls to catch errors. So we cannot just throw an error, in our Error First Callback approach:const callbackFunction = (err, data) => {  if (err) {    throw err;  }  console.log(data);}try {  asyncFunction(callbackFunction);} catch(err) {  // we are not catching the error here  // and the Node.js process will crash  console.error(err);}Forgetting to return in our callback function will let the program continue and cause more errors. The main point here is there are so many quirks to remember and handle here that might cause the code to get into a state that is hard to reason about and debugif (err) {    console.error(err);    return;  }Promises are amazing at chaining multiple async functions together and help you avoid callback hell that can be caused by using the previous method. For error handling, promises use .catch method in the chain to handle exceptions. However, handling errors in them still comes with some concerns:You might get swallowed errors if you forget to use .catch methods in your promise chain. This will cause such an error to be categorized as unhandled error. In that case, we need to have a mechanism in Node.js to handle promise rejections that are not handled. This is done when unhandledRejection event is emitted in Node.js:const fetch = require(""node-fetch"");const url = ""https://wrongAPI.github.com/users/github"";const unhandledRejections = new Map();process.on(""unhandledRejection"", (reason, promise) => {  unhandledRejections.set(promise, reason);  console.log(""unhandledRejections"", unhandledRejections);});const asyncFunction = () => fetch(url);asyncFunction()  .then(res => res.json())  .then(json => console.log(json))Another issue is the traceability of large async function chains. In short, what was the source, origin, and context of thrown error? For example, if you have a long chain of async function calls to handle an API fetch request and several higher-level components that depend on it. These higher-level components also have several children underneath them. An error thrown in any of them can make the traceability of the issue difficultIt is not straightforward how this needs to be handled in Node.js, but one common pattern is to add an immediate .catch methods to the async task in higher-level components and re-throw the error in them again. This helps massively in tracing an error in case it happens in any of their children since we chain another .catch to the instances that call the higher-level async task. Let’s see this with an example:const fetch = require(""node-fetch"");const url = ""https://wrongAPI.github.com/users/github"";// higher level async taskconst asynFunction = () => {  return fetch(url).catch(error => {    // re-throwing the error    throw new Error(error);  });};// error thrown in this intacen 1 is much bette traceable// returns: instace 1 error: invalid json response body at https://wrongapi.github.com/users/github reason: Unexpected token < in JSON at position 0try { return await asyncFunction();} catch(error) {  console.error(""instace 1 error:"", error.message)}Package managerSource: https://unsplash.com/FrustrationThere are several tools for package management in Node.js like npm, yarn, and pnpm, which help you install tools, packages, and dependencies for your application to make the process of software development faster and easier.However, as it is usually with the JavaScript community, defining good and universal standards are happening less and less compared to other languages and frameworks. Just Googling “JavaScript standards” show the lack of standard as people tend not to agree on how to approach JavaScript, except in few cases like Mozilla JS reference — which is very solid. Therefore, it is easy to feel confused about which package manager you need to pick for your project in Node.js.Additionally, there are complaints about the low quality of packages in the Node.js community, which makes it harder for developers to decide if they need to re-invent the wheel and build needed tooling themselves or can they trust the maintained packages.Finally, with JavaScript’s rapid changes, it is no surprise that a lot of packages that our applications are dependent on are changing as well. This requires a smoother package version management in Node.js which sometimes can be troublesome.This, by no means, indicates that Node.js is any worse than other frameworks when it comes to packages and package management, but just a mere reflection of some frustrations that come with Node.js package managers. We will discuss a few of these frustrations like lack of standards, quality of packages, and version management in more detail, but first, we need to have a background on some of the most famous Node.js package managers.Backgroundnpm — This is the official package manager for Node.js. Through its repository, you can publish, search, and install packages. Specifically, in the context of a Node.js project, it does also help you with a CLI command and package.json document to manage your project dependencies and handle version management for themyarn — Consider YARN as an improved version of NPM CLI with the same model of package installation. In addition, it has some other advantages:It is more reliable. Unlike NPM, it uses dual registries by default (npmjs.com and https://bower.io/search/) to make sure the service is still available if any of the registries are downIt is faster. It can download packages in parallel instances and caches all of the installed packages, so it can retrieve them much faster the next time it wants to download. Even though NPM has also done some performance improvements with NPM cachepnpm — This is the newest player among the three. PNPM officially describes itself as a “fast, disk efficient package manager” that seems to be working more efficiently compared to the other two by using symlinks to build your dependencies only once and reusing themDealing with package managersLack of standards — As we have seen above, there are multiple options when it comes to package managers. It is common that when you want to start a project, you might get a bit confused about which one to pick. They have their similarities in 99% of the scenarios, but also possess little quirks in 1% of the instances that can cause issues down the road for maintaining the project. Having worked with all of the above options in production applications, I wish there was a bit more consistency in this areaQuality of packages — Even though you can find a lot of useful packages in Node.js, there is an equivalent number of options that are out-dated, poorly tested, or not maintained. Since publishing packages in the NPM registry is not that difficult, it is on us developers to make sure we choose the right packages for our projects. We can simply vet a package by checking its GitHub repo and check the overall status and maintenance of it. This can be in the form of checking a good balance between a number of issues and open pull requests, good communication from maintainers in the reported issues, and overall usage of the package and its popularity reflected in a number of stars and forks. To make this job even easier, you can type in the name of your package in NPMS, and you get an overall overview of itVersion management — Package managers use semver to handle versioning of packages. With this approach, a sample package versions look like this Major.Minor.Patch, for example 1.0.0. Let’s see an actual package.json and list of dependencies and their versions in action:{  ""name"": ""app"",  ""version"": ""1.0.0"",  ""description"": ""Node.js example"",  ""main"": ""src/index.js"",  ""scripts"": {    ""start"": ""nodemon src/index.js""  },  ""dependencies"": {    ""node-fetch"": ""~2.6.0""  },  ""devDependencies"": {    ""nodemon"": ""^1.18.4""  },}This is already confusing as we get two different symbols in front of package versions. What do they mean?~ or tilde shows a range of acceptable patch versions for a package. For example, we are gonna update the app to all of the future patch updates for node-fetch ranging from 2.6.0 to 2.7.0^ or caret shows a range of acceptable minor/patch versions for a package. For example, we are gonna update the app to all of the future patch updates for nodemon ranging from 1.18.4 to 2.0.0This already seems like a lot of hassle for such a simple task. Additionally, we need to consider the fact that making a mistake in defining the correct range of dependency versions can break the app at some point. However, concepts like package.json.lock or yarn.lock are formed to help avoid making such mistakes by helping to make consistent dependency installs across machines. However, I wish there were more standard approaches in making sure severe problems do not happen due to flawed version control and management system in Node.js.ConclusionThese are some frustrations I experienced with Node.js. But, here are some things to remember:A large portion of Node.js frustrations come from unfamiliarity with JavaScript as the underlying language. Make yourself more familiar with its basic and advance topics and life will be much easier as a Node.js developerMake sure the use case for your Node.js application is valid. For example, a chat application is an awesome candidate for using Node.js. An application with CPU intensive computations, not so much. Familiarize yourself with common use casesFinally, know that any framework can come with certain pain points.

Getting Started with Reactstrap and Alerts,https://medium.com/dev-genius/getting-started-with-reactstrap-and-alerts-f9629808cd63?source=tag_archive---------35-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Christopher Carson on UnsplashReactstrap is a version Bootstrap made for React.It’s a set of React components that have Boostrap styles.In this article, we’ll look at how to get started with Reactstrap and display alerts.Getting startedWe can install Reactstrap by running:npm install --save reactstrapThen we can import the components we need.We also need to install Bootstrap since the Bootstrap CSS isn’t included.So we can write:npm install --save bootstrapThen we can import it by writing:import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';AlertsWe can add alerts with the Alert component.For instance, we can write:import React from ""react"";import { Alert } from ""reactstrap"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  return (    <div className=""App"">      <Alert color=""primary"">        <a href=""#"" className=""alert-link"">          link        </a>{"" ""}        message      </Alert>      <Alert color=""secondary"">        <a href=""#"" className=""alert-link"">          link        </a>{"" ""}        message      </Alert>      <Alert color=""success"">        <a href=""#"" className=""alert-link"">          link        </a>{"" ""}        message      </Alert>      <Alert color=""danger"">        <a href=""#"" className=""alert-link"">          link        </a>{"" ""}        message      </Alert>      <Alert color=""warning"">        <a href=""#"" className=""alert-link"">          link        </a>{"" ""}        message      </Alert>      <Alert color=""info"">        <a href=""#"" className=""alert-link"">          link        </a>{"" ""}        message      </Alert>      <Alert color=""light"">        <a href=""#"" className=""alert-link"">          link        </a>{"" ""}        message      </Alert>      <Alert color=""dark"">        <a href=""#"" className=""alert-link"">          link        </a>{"" ""}        message      </Alert>    </div>  );}We have the Alert component with the color prop to set the color.className has the color for the link.Additional Content for AlertsWe can add extra content to alerts.For example, we can write:import React from ""react"";import { Alert } from ""reactstrap"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  return (    <div className=""App"">      <Alert color=""primary"">        <h4 className=""alert-heading"">title</h4>        <p>          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Donec ut arcu          lacinia, condimentum sapien et, molestie eros. Nulla a molestie ante,          vitae scelerisque odio. Integer ipsum quam, viverra quis ipsum          dapibus,        </p>        <hr />        <p className=""mb-0"">          Fusce vitae eros varius, consequat mi at, consequat urna. Sed egestas          nisl quis magna rutrum tincidunt ac eu tortor.        </p>      </Alert>    </div>  );}We added p and hr elements to our alert.mb-0 removes the bottom margin.Dismissing AlertsWe can make alerts dismissible by making them controlled components.For instance, we can write:import React from ""react"";import { Alert } from ""reactstrap"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  const [visible, setVisible] = React.useState(true);  const onDismiss = () => setVisible(false);  return (    <div className=""App"">      <Alert color=""info"" isOpen={visible} toggle={onDismiss}>        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.      </Alert>    </div>  );}We have the visible state to toggle the alert on or off.It’s passed into the isOpen prop to toggle the alert.toggle has the onDismiss function to set visible to false to make the alert disappear.The close button is shown and we can click it to call onDismiss .Uncontrolled AlertsWe can make dismissible alerts without making them uncontrolled.To do that, we can import the UncontrolledAlert component.For instance, we can write:import React from ""react"";import { UncontrolledAlert } from ""reactstrap"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  return (    <div className=""App"">      <UncontrolledAlert color=""info"">        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.      </UncontrolledAlert>    </div>  );}Now we don’t need the state change logic that we had before.Alerts without FadeBy default, the alert has the fade transition effect.To disable the fade effect, we can set the fade prop to false :import React from ""react"";import { Alert } from ""reactstrap"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  const [visible, setVisible] = React.useState(true);  const onDismiss = () => setVisible(false);  return (    <div className=""App"">      <Alert color=""primary"" isOpen={visible} toggle={onDismiss} fade={false}>        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.      </Alert>    </div>  );}We added the prop in the controlled alert.Also, we can do the same with uncontrolled alerts:import React from ""react"";import { UncontrolledAlert } from ""reactstrap"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  return (    <div className=""App"">      <UncontrolledAlert color=""info"" fade={false}>        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.      </UncontrolledAlert>    </div>  );}Photo by Kenneth Schipper Vera on UnsplashConclusionWe can install the Reactstrap and Bootstrap packages to add Reactstrap to our app.Also, we can use alerts to display notifications.Dev GeniusCoding, Tutorials, News, UX, UI and much more related to developmentFollow15 Sign up for Best StoriesBy Dev GeniusThe best stories sent monthly to your email. Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

Up and running with Sass and Gerillass,https://medium.com/gerillass/up-and-running-with-sass-and-gerillass-b2e9ab2a85c1?source=tag_archive---------36-----------------------,"Sass,Web Development,Web Design,Front End Development,CSS","Create modern web sites using Sass and Gerillass!If you always wanted to learn what Sass is and how to install and run it on your computer, this post is precisely for you.We will explore different ways to install Sass and run it on your machine to compile Sass related files to CSS files.We will then get to know a magnificent Sass extension named Gerillass (which will help us create responsive page layouts and decorative design components in later posts).Important: This post is not about the Sass syntax and usage in depth. It is about up and running Sass (as a pre-processor) and the Gerillass Sass library to make you ready to start using these two technologies to create beautiful web sites.Table of ContentWhat is Sass?How to install Sass?Installing Sass using Command-Line InterfaceA short introduction to the Sass Command-line InterfaceUp and running with Sass via Third-Party GUI applicationsKoala AppWhat is Gerillass?How to install the Gerillass Sass Library?ConclusionWhat is Sass?Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a programming language that supports you in generating CSS files using some programming features like variables, loops, math operators, functions, etc.But the browsers do not understand Sass, so our Sass codes must be processed and translated into CSS. That is why Sass is called pre-processed language, and we need a wrapper (pre-processor) to compile our code from Sass language to CSS.Note that there are different types of wrappers (Sass pre-processors), so you may need to pick one depending on the project you are working on.To learn more about the wrappers, check the following links:https://sass-lang.com/libsasshttps://sass-lang.com/dart-sassHow to Install Sass?There are several ways of installing and running Sass. Here, we will cover two methods to achieve this goal: One is to install and run Sass by the command-line interface, and the second is to use a third-party GUI application.You can use whichever of these methods you find convenient.Note: Truly, there are many ways of installing and running Sass. After reading this post, please, feel free to look for them and find the best way for you to run Sass on your computer.Installing Sass using Command-Line InterfaceOne way of installing and using Sass is the command-line interface. While it is the most familiar and preferred way for web developers, it can sometimes be very annoying for the beginners (it was to me at first).1. Installing Sass via npmIf you use Node.js, you can install Sass via npm (Node Package Manager) by running the following command:npm install -g sassNote that the Mac users may need to use sudo at the beginning.sudo npm install -g sassNote: Installing Sass via npm will install the pure JavaScript implementation of Sass. That means file processing will be somehow slower than the other Sass implementations. But don’t worry, the interface will be the same. If you like to be faster, you can swap to another Sass implementation later, easily.2. Installing Sass via Homebrew (for MacOS X and Linux users only)If you use the Homebrew package manager you can install Dart Sass by running the following command:brew install sass/sass/sass3. Downloading Sass from Github (Standalone)You can download the Sass repository for your operating system from Github and keep it anywhere on your Windows, Mac, or Linux computer.Download Link: https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releasesExtract the downloaded file, replace the folder anywhere on your computer, and set the PATH options. That’s it; you don’t need to install any other dependencies.For more information, please check the installation details.A short introduction to the Sass Command-line InterfaceAfter you install Sass by using one of the methods mentioned above, you can check the version to be sure that you installed it correctly by running the following command:sass --versionIf you see the version number, it’s good to go; now you can run the following command to compile your Sass code to CSS:sass assets/scss/styles.scss assets/css/styles.cssRun the following command to watch the code changes and recompile the Sass file when you save it:sass --watch assets/scss/styles.scss assets/css/styles.cssYou can also run the following command for more information about the command-line interface.sass --helpPlease check the Sass Guide at https://sass-lang.com/guide to learn more about the Sass basics.Up and running with Sass via Third-Party GUI applicationsThere are outstanding third-party GUI applications that will get you up and running with Sass just in a couple of minutes. Some of them are paid, some others are not.Here’s a list of both free and paid Sass applications:Koala (Open Source) Mac, Windows, LinuxScout-App (Free, Open Source) Mac, Windows, LinuxSassMeister (Free) Online ToolLiveReload (Paid, Open Source) Mac, WindowsCompass.app (Paid, Open Source) Mac, Windows, LinuxPrepros (Paid) Mac, Windows, LinuxCodeKit (Paid) for Mac onlyHammer (Paid) for Mac onlyGhostlab (Paid) for Mac onlyKoala AppKoala: The best Sass compiler ever!Koala is my favorite GUI application for Sass (although it is no longer under development since 2017). It is free, available for all the operating systems, and very easy to use. You are all free to use another application, of course, but I guarantee you that Koala is the most comfortable GUI application for Sass so far.That’s why I will explain how to install and use Koala to compile our .scss and .sass files to .css files.Note: I’m a macOS user; if you use another operating system, don’t worry, installation is very easy and the usage will be pretty much the same.Compiling our Sass files with KoalaVisit the Koala web site at http://koala-app.com/ and click the large green button to download the Koala installer file.Install the Koala application into your machine and then start the program. If you see the below screen, that means it is good to go!That is the start screen of the Koala application. You can either click on the plus icon or drag and drop a folder into the application screen to add a new project.We don’t have any project folder yet. Let’s create one on the desktop and give it a name. I name it sass_project, you whatever you want.When you are in that folder create a file named styles.scss, and open it with your favorite code editor (my favorite code editor is Visual Studio Code) and write some style rules in it.Now, let’s add this project folder to Koala to watch the code changes and compile styles.scss file to styles.css file automatically.To do that, you can drag and drop the sass_project folder into the application screen or click on the plus icon at the top left corner and select the project folder from the opening window.As soon as you add the project folder to Koala, the application will automatically process all the Sass files in that folder. Thus you can see a list of those Sass files on the application screen.Now, if you click the refresh button, you will see the compiled CSS file too.You can filter the types of files showing in here by using the filtering options at the bottom of the application screen.If you want to change the compiling settings of a Sass file, you have to click on it to see the options related to that specific Sass file at the right-hand side of the application screen.I’m not going to cover all the options here, just the important ones.Auto Compile: Helps you compile all the Sass files automatically when you add a new project to the application, and watch the file changes and compile when you save them. This option is activated by default.Source Map: Adds a source map into your CSS files (Source map helps you debug the Sass code in the browser). The source map option is activated by default.Autoprefix: If you want to add vendor prefix support to your CSS codes, activate this option.Output Style: You can change the output style of the generated CSS file. There are “nested,” “expanded,” “compact,” and “compressed” options here. You can choose one of the options listed here that fits your needs.You can change the style of the generated CSS file, thus you can create lightweight CSS outputs for the production.Now let’s create another Sass file named typography.scss in the project folder to see how to deal with multiple Sass files.After that, open Koala and click the refresh button on the application screen to see the new file.Note that when you create or add a new Sass file in an available project, it is necessary to compile the new Sass file manually for one time only. Depending on the Sass configuration you prefer for that specific file, you can set the compilation setting to “Auto Compile” to compile it automatically or you can keep compile it manually.Now click the typography.scss file and be sure that the “Auto Compile” checkbox is checked. Now click the “compile” button to compile it.Easy, don’t you think?What is Gerillass?Gerillass is a web development tool built on top of Sass to create modern web design components easily.It is a collection of Sass mixins and functions that will fasten your web development processes and help you create consistent and scalable CSS outputs regardless of the size of the project you are working on.In this post, I’m only going to cover the installation of Gerillass and including it to our sass_project. But if you want to learn more about how to use it, feel free to visit the documentation page at https://docs.gerillass.com/.How to install the Gerillass Sass library?If you are working on a Node.js project you can install Gerillass via npm:npm install gerillassOr use Yarn to do that:yarn add gerillassIf you are not using one of the package managers mentioned above you can visit the Gerillass site at https://gerillass.com/ and click the download button to get the library.Uncompress the downloaded file and change the folder name from “gerillass-master” to “gerillass”, and drag it into our sass_project folder.Now open the sass_project folder with your code editor.Let’s import the Gerillass Sass library to our project. Simply add the following code line at the beginning of our stylesheet:@import ""gerillass/scss/gerillass"";Now, let’s call any mixin from the Gerillass Sass library to see if it works correctly.Please copy the code below and past it wherever you want in the stylesheet.@include antialias;Open the compiled CSS file to see the changes.You can see the newly added code between lines 10 and 14.It’s alive!ConclusionWe installed and ran Sass, and then we created a Sass project. We compiled our Sass files to CSS, and finally, we installed a Sass library named Gerillass and include it in our project.Probably you are asking yourself, “Why using Gerillass?” The answer is simple: There are dozens of handy utilities in the Gerillass Sass library that will help you create responsive and consistent web sites quickly.From here, you can create your projects using Sass and Gerillass.To learn more about Gerillass, please visit the official site or check the documentation page. If you have any questions, please contact me. I will gladly answer.Thank you for reading so far.

It’ll have an entire block of code that is only PHP, and it prints out HTML (and CSS and JavaScript for that matter).There’s a better way though.Take a look at lines 1 to 15 below. It does the same as lines 20–32:The second section is easier to read (and write!).A web server ultimately evaluates all of the code and prints out HTML. It doesn’t matter if you write the HTML in, or out, of the <?php … ?> tags.Why Is This So Good?Sometimes it gets tricky when the HTML you want to print out has single or double quotes (ex. specifying a Link or a Style/CSS class).I have two solutions for this:Start/end your statement with the opposite type of quote that you need“Escape” the data, by adding a slash right before the quoteBoth of these are inconvenient 😜The next comparison example shows a real-world example demonstrating it’s easier to read, especially because most editors will color-code the different HTML tags. Note the first example has two instances of printing out a link (each using a different method as described above).This is the same code as above, but a screenshot from my editor (Sublime Text) that better shows the color-coding of HTML tags:Printing HTML in PHP: A Best PracticeThere’s a shortcut to printing out text, where you use an equal sign instead of the opening “PHP” tag. I suggest avoiding it though. Compare these two:<?php // This works, but don't do it ?><?=""Hello"";?><?php // instead do this ?><?php print ""Hello""; ?>The reason to not use the first one is that, if you were read in an XML file without specifying “php” then you may get errors. XML files also have <? . It’s better to get in the habit of explicitly using <?php print… to display the text.And yes, “echo” and “print” do the same thing in PHP.Like this style of writing? 👍👍 Are you creating a PHP web application and already know what a “variable” is and the concept of an “if” statement?

Why should I learn web development?,https://medium.com/codechef-vit/why-should-i-learn-web-development-731cdea2ab6f?source=tag_archive---------38-----------------------,"Coding,Web Development,Front End Development,Back End Development,Website Development","If you’ve ever wondered how the internet works, and how websites are made, give this a read.Photo by Andy Holmes on UnsplashWeb development is a comprehensive domain that covers the entire process of building a website — from making the layout to hosting the website and maintaining it. More than that, it is a fast-paced, dynamic career option that requires a quick mind and excellent problem-solving skills.Why web development?If you’ve ever dreamed of bagging that super dream package and working in a FAANG company, web development is the way to go.According to the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics, the percentage change in employment in web development from 2019 to 2029 is a whopping 8%, astoundingly larger than the average of 4%! This means that in terms of job opportunities, web development is a booming sector with a predictably increasing demand.Apart from that, web development is a must-have skill for anyone who wishes to build brilliant projects and showcase them in hackathons!There are two major aspects to making a website: front end and back end web development.Front end or client-sidePhoto by Carlos Muza on UnsplashThe part of the website that the user can see and interact with is called the frontend. Frontend acts as the face of your website and is a crucial skill to master in order to make a lasting first impression. It has three main components -HTML — The basic skeleton of the website is designed using HTML. Using HTML, you decide where the heading goes, how you want to layout the body, and so on.CSS — CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is responsible for beautifying your web page. What should the border width and colour of that box be? How should the button behave when I hover on it? These are some of the questions that CSS answers.Javascript — Javascript is the brain of the frontend. It is concerned with decisions such as — what happens when I click that button? How to show the system date and time on my website? Javascript adds interactivity to your website.Backend or server-sidePhoto by Science in HD on UnsplashWhen you open up a web page on your browser, you’re basically interacting with a large computer called a server. A server, as the name suggests, is something that “serves up” a website on request. Servers basically store the website and all the data associated with it and respond to requests to retrieve that data.Backend web development deals with linking your website to a server that will store the pre-created HTML, CSS and JS files using a database. It is written in various languages, however, many developers tend to prefer Javascript, having used it in the frontend already. Nodejs is a Javascript runtime environment that executes Javascript code outside of a web server.Hence, both front end and back end are crucial to understand for you to build beautiful, fully functional websites.Where to begin?If you’ve ever looked up resources on web development, you must’ve been overwhelmed by the multitude of online courses and websites, each seeming better than the other. Confusing to pick one, isn’t it?One possible way to approach this vast field could be by getting a step by step overview of it, how the basics work, and try to build a website from scratch yourself. After gleaning all the knowledge needed to make a website by yourself, you can dive deep into the domain of your choice — front end or backend (or both) with newfound confidence.Building Functional WebApps, a two-day workshop on web development, is an opportunity for the same. At Building Functional WebApps, we aim to give you a head start into the thrilling world of web development, within a span of 8 hours. Our goal is to help you learn the basics of this vast domain, with the help of industry experts from companies like Amazon and Redhat. And guess what?

A Short Introduction to Draft Pull Requests,https://levelup.gitconnected.com/a-short-introduction-to-draft-pull-requests-81d46fea4d7f?source=tag_archive---------39-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Github,Pull Request","And the story of how they made me a better engineerToday I want to take the time to share with you one of my all-time favorite Github features — Draft Pull Requests. I have been actively using them in my development flow for about 12 months now.Lately, I realized that working with draft pull requests has dramatically improved the way I structure and organize my daily engineering work as well as the efficiency with which I solve problems and deliver value for my stakeholders.PrerequisitesI approach this topic with the assumption that you are familiar with the basic Github development flow. If that’s not the case, I suggest you take the time to get yourself familiarised with it. Trust me, you won’t regret it.IntroductionHere is the list of characteristics applicable to normal pull requests:they enable you to start a discussion about the code you have committed in a branch that belongs to a specific Github repositoryother developers can review your code and give suggestions for improvements and optimizationsonce the discussion phase is over and everyone is satisfied with your proposal, you can merge your pull request into the master branch and officially add your changes to the codebaseNow, let’s have a look at the characteristics that make draft pull requests unique:they explicitly label your code changes as “work in progress”they cannot be merged into the master branch directlyThe meaning of Draft PRsWhen you open a pull request and set its status as “draft” you are in fact making the following statement to your teammates:Hey, there fellow colleagues, As you know, I am currently working on a solution to problem X. Here is the code I have written so far. Yes, I am aware my implementation is far from complete, so I am not ready to open a PR for review yet. However, I would love to get your feedback and insights on the approach I am planning to take.After all, the sooner you get the conversation going the easier it will be to reach a consensus about the best way to code the solution.How Draft PRs made me a better engineerBefore I started working with draft pull requests, I was a bit shy about sharing incomplete work with my colleagues. I always thought that they would think less of me if my implementation looked off. I know it sounds ridiculous, but at the time — that was my truth.Working with draft PRs helped me to change my mindset. You see, now I had a way to put my work out there and label it as in progress. This automatically took off the pressure I had previously placed on myself. I no longer had to “produce” the “perfect” code, before letting my colleagues have a look at it.And as time went by, I realized the truth that was staring at me the whole time — no one was gonna judge me or blame me if I put out an imperfect implementation. In fact, people would go out of their way to help me by sharing their thoughts about my work as well as give me some ideas about how I can make my code better.So I started getting excited about sharing my work with others. I no longer cared if mine was “the best implementation” ever written. I just wanted to learn and grow as an engineer by getting as much feedback and input from my teammates.  You see, in the process of working with draft PRs, I had learned one more very important lesson — on my own I could only go so far. If I truly wanted to accelerate my growth as a developer, I needed to allow myself to learn from the experience of the people around me.ConclusionAs you can probably tell, I am a vivid supporter of using Draft PRs. I have experienced first hand the positive impact they had on me and my teammates. That’s why I recommend checking them out. They might be good for you, or not. But as my mentor always tells me — you never try, you never know ;)Level Up CodingCoding tutorials and news.Follow36 ProgrammingWeb DevelopmentGithubPull Request36 claps36 clapsWritten byVelina PetrovaFollowFull Stack Web Developer & Full-Time Problem Solver.

Integration of Fondy (3rd party service) webhooks using QuickMocker and its Local Forwarder,https://medium.com/@nostop8/integration-of-fondy-3rd-party-service-webhooks-using-quickmocker-and-its-local-forwarder-fe03ee9041?source=tag_archive---------40-----------------------,"Webhooks,Web Development,API,Fondy,Quickmocker","So you are a developer and you’ve got yet another task to integrate some 3rd party into your app? E.g. some payment system like Stripe, PayPal or maybe some meeting rooms like Zoom, GoTo or whatever else you can imagine to integrate? Nowadays all of such services provide API not only as an interface for receiving requests from clients (e.g. your web app), but also they can make reverse requests to your app in order to notify the client immediately about some event on the 3-rd party side. This kind of reverse requests as you might guess already are called Webhooks.Diagram of the interaction between app and 3rd PartyAs a sample we will be integrating Fondy (a payment service provider) into our app. Particularly in this sample we need to integrate the instant notification (webhook) to our application about payment completion. On the server side we will use PHP code samples and on the client side it will be Javascript.But first of all you’ll need to register your Fondy account. Then go to the Merchant Settings and grab your Merchant ID and Payment Key (also called “secret key” in the API doc):Secondly go and get a free QuickMocker account. Create a new project with a suggested random subdomain. Go inside the project and copy your endpoint (subdomain) URL:QuickMocker’s Project Domain and EndpointsPlease note that by default the initial wildcard endpoint can intercept any request made to any URL of the project. It will respond with 404 status code by default, but you can change this behavior if you want.Now we will build a simple PHP web service (or simply script) with the help of Fondy PHP SDK (v2) that will generate for us a one-time token that we’ll use for creating a payment form. In case you use composer, you can add Fondy PHP SDK using this command:composer require cloudipsp/php-sdk-v2Alternatively you might download or clone it. See yourself more here: https://packagist.org/packages/cloudipsp/php-sdk-v2Later we will use this token to securely generate order form on the client side using Fondy JavaScript SDK. Huh… a lot of words which might sound as a non-sense :) But I hope they will start making sense if you look at the code sample below:<?phpinclude 'vendor/autoload.php'; // in case you use composeruse Cloudipsp\Configuration;use Cloudipsp\Checkout;Configuration::setMerchantId('<fondyMerchantID>');Configuration::setSecretKey('<fondyPaymentKey>');Configuration::setApiVersion('2.0');$request = ['order_id' => time(),'currency' => 'USD','merchant_id' => '<fondyMerchantID>','order_desc' => 'QuickMocker Test Order','product_id' => 'test','amount' => 1, // equals 1 cent'required_rectoken' => 'Y', // might use this if you want to charge your customers later without customer interaction, e.g. for recurring payments'server_callback_url' => 'https://qafu2mppt7.api.quickmocker.com', // this is where our QuickMocker endpoint gets inserted, change it to your own.];$response = Checkout::token($request);$data = $response->getData();echo $data['token'];So the script above generates for us a one-time token that we can use in order to create a payment form in the client app. This form will already get the payment amount that we have set on the server side (so nobody can replace it in the client app). But the main thing is that this payment is linked with our internal order ID and product ID which again cannot be hijacked.Now lets create a simple JS client app which we can try out on some online service like JsFiddle, where we’ll use our token generated by the PHP script we had written above. You might customize the look of the payment form using CSS. You can even hide some fields like email, in case you do not want allowing user to change it (remember we have an order ID which can be linked with the user and its email in our app’s database).So, first of all you have to include following JS and CSS file in your app provided by Fondy CDN:https://pay.fondy.eu/latest/checkout.jshttps://pay.fondy.eu/latest/checkout.cssAnd below are all the parts of the app, separately (HTML, JS and CSS):HTML Part:<!-- Only one container needed to place the fondy payment form --><div id=""checkout-container""></div>JavaScript Part:var options = {  options: {    fullScreen: true,    fee: true,    title: 'QuickMocker Test',    email: true,    link: 'https://quickmocker.com',    tooltip: true,  },  params: {    token: '7d6c8299fc906793fc1b3036dc9722d826eb3b60', // place your token here to see checkout form instead of payment is approved    email: 'your.email@testemail.com',  },};window.fondy('#checkout-container', options).$on(""success"", (model) => {  var order_status = model.attr(""order.order_data.order_status"");  if (order_status == ""approved"") {    alert('Your payment was successfully processed.');  }}).$on(""error"", function (model) { var response_description = model.attr(""error.message""); alert('There was a problem with your payment. Details: ' + response_description);});CSS Part:/* Sample styles for the fondy payment form */.f-header {  background: #d5ecff;}.f-wrapper {  background: #daf7d8 !important;}All of the parts together on the JSFiddle here:https://jsfiddle.net/wf64gbr2/Screenshot from JSFiddle of all parts together including some additional commentsIn order to make a payment, lets use test credit cards, which you may find at this URL: https://docs.fondy.eu/en/docs/page/2/ . Copy the card number, provide any month, year and CVV code you want and hit Pay Now button.Right after the payment is completed successfully, QuickMocker endpoint immediately receives a request (webhook) from Fondy:Notification about new requests to the endpointClick on the Requests Log tab, and you’ll see the list of the requests that was done to your endpoint. Unfold the top request which is the latest as on the screenshot:Fondy webhook request viewBy the way, we did not add any custom endpoint to receive Fondy webhooks, so it is intercepted by QuickMocker using the initial wildcard endpoint which responds with 404 status code by default. Because of this Fondy might send to you several webhook requests with the same payment result data. You can add another endpoint for the Fondy webhook or else simply change status code of the initial endpoint to 200.Anyway, as you can see on the screenshot above, the data is sent as a base64. If you decode it you will see a JSON similar to this:{   ""order"":{      ""rrn"":"""",      ""masked_card"":""444455XXXXXX6666"",      ""sender_cell_phone"":"""",      ""response_status"":""success"",      ""sender_account"":"""",      ""fee"":"""",      ""rectoken_lifetime"":""01.01.2034 00:00:00"",      ""reversal_amount"":""0"",      ""settlement_amount"":""0"",      ""actual_amount"":""8442"",      ""order_status"":""approved"",      ""response_description"":"""",      ""verification_status"":"""",      ""order_time"":""24.09.2020 17:41:32"",      ""order_id"":""1600980123"",      ""parent_order_id"":"""",      ""merchant_data"":"""",      ""tran_type"":""purchase"",      ""eci"":""7"",      ""settlement_date"":"""",      ""payment_system"":""card"",      ""rectoken"":""e07e0989bcdffaa446909438b367c136cc90bac7"",      ""approval_code"":""478450"",      ""merchant_id"":1436164,      ""settlement_currency"":"""",      ""payment_id"":272767812,      ""product_id"":""test"",      ""currency"":""USD"",      ""card_bin"":444455,      ""response_code"":"""",      ""card_type"":""VISA"",      ""amount"":""1"",      ""sender_email"":""your.email@testemail.com""   }}In order to make sure that this data is not spoofed, we need to validate it against the signature which was sent inside the webhook along with the data.<?phpinclude 'vendor/autoload.php'; // in case you use composeruse Cloudipsp\Configuration;use Cloudipsp\Response\Response;$requestBody = file_get_contents('php://input');$requestData = json_decode($requestBody, true);Configuration::setMerchantId('<fondyMerchantID>');Configuration::setSecretKey('<fondyPaymentKey>');Configuration::setApiVersion('2.0');$response = new Response([    'response' => json_encode([        'response' => $requestData,    ], 320),]);if (!$response->isValid()) {    print ""Error: Invalid data"";} else {    $order = $response->getData();    print ""Success: Order ID: "" . $order['order_id'];}So we have successfully captured the webhook from 3-rd party service using QuickMocker API mocking tool. Knowing the webhook request data allows us to create a proper web service that can handle this data and complete our order on the server side of the app (e.g. mark the order in the database as paid, save the `rectoken` for possible future charges of the customer etc). So such API mocking tools like QuickMocker are very helpful in a reverse integration with 3-rd parties without having to put our app into public, which means our app does not need to have some public DNS or IP address during the development stage.The only inconvenience here you might think is that if we want to test our code, we still have to mimic the request to our local server app with that data captured by QuickMocker using some tool like Postman which adds a bit of overhead here in a form of a manual intervention during the testing. But wait… except of capturing requests from remote services, QuickMocker can also work as a local client forwarder, which means while QuickMocker is opened in your browser and while it receives the requests from the outside, it can also forward those requests to your “localhost” server app.How to setup forwarder? Simply set your local development server app URL, which will receive the payment completion webhook from the fondy (e.g. http://localhost/fondy-payment-completed). To do this click on the Set Local Forwarder button:Set Local ForwarderAnd in the modal provide URL. Note: in case your development server app is using insecure protocol (HTTP), you will need to allow this in your browser settings. Read more about allowing your browser to send HTTP request from HTTPS site here: https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/target/using/experiences/vec/troubleshoot-composer/mixed-content.htmlProvide URL you want the request to be forwarded toClick Set and you are done. Now the requests will be forwarded to your local app URL and you are all set to receive webhooks directly to your app while developing, debugging, testing and so on. Please note that Local Forwarder URL won’t be saved with your project. As soon as you leave the Requests Log tab, the URL will be gone. So you will have to set it once again if you want to continue “forwarding”.BTW, there’s a small FAQ which should provide all info you need for Local Forwarder usage: https://quickmocker.com/faq#forwarderFinally, after you set Local Forwarder URL, you’ll also notice another tab Forwarder Response in the request panel:Forwarder Response tabOur app has received a forwarded webhook and we can also preview the response of our app in the additional tab as on the screenshot above.To sum up: an API mocking (fake) tools like QuickMocker could be really helpful while integrating 3rd party services and particularly reverse requests called webhooks. With the help of Local Forwarder feature that is provided by QuickMocker, the integration of webhooks becomes even more seamless without any need to make your local server application public to the world.Written bynostop8Yet another developerFollowWebhooksWeb DevelopmentAPIFondyQuickmockerMore from nostop8FollowYet another developerMore From MediumRunning Go, Vue applications & MySQL database in Docker containerWilson Tan in The StartupHow to Do Text Search in MongoDBVarun Bansal in Better ProgrammingLets make a Binary Search TreeKennet Postigo in ReasonTrainingHow to Build a Slack App That Scrapes Websites for DataJaneth Ledezma in Better ProgrammingHow Meditation Can Make You a Better Software DeveloperHuseyin Polat Yuruk in Better ProgrammingGo, WebAssembly, HTTP Requests, and PromisesAlessandro Segala in Better ProgrammingProvision Docker on multiple OS using AnsibleDaksh JainHow To Run a GCP Dataflow Pipeline From Local MachineBhargav Bachina in Bachina LabsAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
"Codeigniter: Controllers, Models, Views, And Autoload Libraries",https://medium.com/dsc-dypcoe/codeigniter-controllers-models-views-and-autoload-libraries-70c4de86a4da?source=tag_archive---------41-----------------------,"Codeigniter,Codeigniter Development,Codeigniter Developer,Codeigniter 4,Web Development","Hi! I Hope Now You Know What Is Codeigniter, How to Download and Take it in action and You Know about Directories of Codeigniter folders. In This Article, we will go with Important Points in Codeigniter.Get the Previous ArticleIn this article, we’re Going to Have a look on- Controllers Models Views Autoload Libraries  And Then in the Next Article, we will start with our CRUD Application   So, Let’s Begin…   What Is Controllers?   Controllers Are The Main Part of Codeigniter. Ok, basically you can Say it as Brain of Codeigniter. All basic components of the Application Are Written in Controllers.   We Can Start by just creating a file in the application/controller folder here ‘mycode.php’, right.   So, what we are going to do is writing ‘Public Class Mycode extends CI_Controllers’ and give a curly opening bracket ‘{‘ as You Can see In the Screenshot below.Now it has started. I am giving function class Create().Ok, so this is Beginning We will back to the Same Folder Just after Getting Look to Views fine.  Views:   Views as Name Represent, Visible part of Our Web Is going to be written in Views Folder.  So similarly let's Create a folder let have the name ‘mycode_view.php’ in ‘application/views’.   So Here We Are Going To Write Everything That We Want To Make Visible To User.  Here I am just going to echo ‘Hello World’ I will change it later but You can have a look as shown below in the screenshot.So, Now We Have Created a view but it will not be visible to the user unless we did not involve it in Controller. So How We are going to do that, opening ‘application/controllers’ and my file ‘mycode.php’.  Here I Will include view with $this->load->view(‘mycode_view’);  The Most Important thing Don’t Write .php extension after the file name. You can have a look at the image.Now The Main Part That Is How We Are Connecting with Database Here MySQL right so as You Know from the Previous Article that it is written in Models. So We Will Go With That.   Models:  In Models, All Queries to Connect with Database are written.Similarly, we are starting with creating a folder in ‘application/models’. I am creating ‘mycode_model.php’.We are going to write ‘class mycode_model extends CI_models’ and an opening curly bracket ‘{‘ it started.Now, we can write our queries here.So, we can call model in our controller by writing ‘$this->load->model(‘mycode_model’);’You can have look in the Screenshot below.Now Our Model Has Called.How We Write Queries in Models?Ok So I Have to Let Insert, Then Query is‘$this->db->insert(‘insertable_item’, ‘table_name’);’For Delete,‘$this->db->delete(‘deletable_item’, ‘table_name’);’For Display,‘$this->db->get(‘table_name’);’Ok as we will see CRUD you will Get Known of That.Now Before We Go with Writing Query, we have to autoload the database in the autoload folder.It is available in Application/config/autoload.phpAutoload Library:Some of The Library is Autoloaded in Autoload.There are Various Autoload Library We Can load without describing again and again in Controller.Some are Form_validation, ‘Session’ ‘db’, and more.localhost/bcit-ci-CodeIgniter-b73eb19/index.php/mycode/CreateWe are going to paste this URL in the browser and you can get outputWhat is this URL?Localhost: my hostname. If I Have Domain dscdypcoe.in then it will be replaced by Localhost.bcit-ci-CodeIgniter-b73eb19: is my folder nameIndex.php: it is index callingMycode: constructor nameCreate: function in ConstructorIn Our Next Article, All of your Doubt Will be clear.Stay Safe.Keep Reading.Thanks.DSC DYPCOEFrom the Comunity To the CommunityFollow28 Sign up for DSC DYPCOE WeeklyBy DSC DYPCOEGet awesome content, latest tech news, articles and awesome stuff straight to your inbox.

Reactstrap — Cards and Groups,https://medium.com/@hohanga/reactstrap-cards-and-groups-38bf9c35d8c8?source=tag_archive---------42-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Clarissa Carbungco on UnsplashReactstrap is a version Bootstrap made for React.It’s a set of React components that have Boostrap styles.In this article, we’ll look at how to customize cards with Reactstrap.Outline VariantsCards have outlined variantsThe borders have colors, but the rest don’t.For example, we can add the outlines by adding the outline prop:import React from ""react"";import { Card, Button, CardTitle, CardText } from ""reactstrap"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  return (    <div className=""App"">      <Card body color=""primary"" outline>        <CardTitle>Title</CardTitle>        <CardText>          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Should you learn Javascript?,https://medium.com/probably-programming/should-you-learn-javascript-6520b5dde849?source=tag_archive---------43-----------------------,"JavaScript,Careers,Technology,Programming,Web Development","Some people would probably skip topics like this, but it’s important to understand what Javascript is now. Otherwise, you’ll end up trying to learn something you don’t like and quit.Image by skeeze from PixabayJavascript is most known as the language of the WebGoogle uses Javascript both its front-end and back-end. Facebook is written using Javascript. Amazon uses many languages including Javascript. Twitter uses Javascript along with many other languages. I’ll cut it there, but just know that Javascript is almost everywhere on the web.What is Javascript?Javascript is a:High-Level: In short, high-level languages are easy to understand, simple to maintain, and are able to run on any platform. The drawbacks would be that high-level languages are less memory efficient, they can’t directly communicate with the hardware, and are slower to translate than low-level languages.Interpreted: To my knowledge, there are two different systems that computers use to translate our programs — a compiler and an interpreter. A compiler gathers the code, checks the syntax of the code, and tells you the error before the program can run. While the interpreter reads the code line-by-line while it is running and throws an error to you while the program is running.Multi-paradigm: The common programming paradigms are imperative and declarative. The imperative paradigm requires a step-by-step order of how you want things done. While the declarative paradigm requires that you tell it what you want, not how you want things done. I’ll use cooking as an example. If you cook the “imperative” way, you create an ordered list of how you want your food prepared and cooked. While cooking the “declarative” way means that you tell the cook what you want to be prepared and let the cook handle how it’s done.If you’re still confused, there is an excellent article that goes more into depth called Imperative vs. Declarative Programming (procedural, functional, and OOP).What can you do with Javascript?These are just a few examples with what you can do with Javascript:1. Add interactive behaviors on websites2. Game Development3. Making Web and Mobile Apps4. Building web servers and developing server applications5. Machine LearningIs it in demand?Forget the Click Bait. Here’s What the JavaScript Job Market Really Looks Like. Is an excellent article, and the author, Eric Elliott, is someone I actively follow on Medium.But I’d like to try my hand anyways. With all the data that has been compiled by a multitude of websites, it is safe to say that Javascript will remain in demand for the foreseeable future. According to StackOverflow Developer Survey 2019, Javascript is the most popular technology amongst “All Respondents” and “Professional Developers”. The same survey also shows Javascript-based tools, like Node.js, React, and Angular, are also in demand.StackOverflow Developer Survey, 2019Javascript Salary and Benefits?According to indeed.com, Javascript developers make an average of about $118,201 a year.indeed.com, Javascript Developer Salaryindeed.com, Javascript Developer BenefitsConclusionJavascript is a great language to experiment with. Its popularity is only growing and is in demand for the foreseeable future. But be careful if you’re thinking of doing this for the money, technologies advance year after year so it’s best that you find a language you actually like. If you’re just getting started, FreeCodeCamp and The Odin Project are two incredibly useful resources that I use and enjoy.

Series: On Waiting for the Job…,https://medium.com/@mcgeehee/series-on-waiting-for-the-job-b57c83659cfc?source=tag_archive---------44-----------------------,"Software Development,Job Hunting,Web Development,Software Engineering,Job Search","These articles will describe my daily routine from where I am now until I get a software development job.Feelings, frustrations, hopes, expectations, disappointments, perseverance.Photo by Ümit Bulut on UnsplashThis series started after a job rejection that completely shocked me because of how hopeful I was about it. The company was small. The hiring manager acted very excited to talk with me (he even later stated that he enjoyed our conversation after I asked for feedback). They were specifically looking to hire a junior dev.What was most shocking is how sudden the news came. I was in step two of the hiring process, and I was thinking I’d at least get to the next step consisting of a longer interview. The hiring manager and I even talked about me blogging my experience of becoming a developer in his company so I created a mock block site to show him in our interview to visualize what it could look like. I anticipated sending it to him once we scheduled the interview.It didn’t even take long to go from this seems really positive to nope. It was like over-night he changed his mind. That’s why I had to ask for feedback. He responded that there was a lot of competition, but he enjoyed talking with me and good luck. I had to take a moment to collect myself because I couldn’t believe that just like that, it was over. I then decided to slow myself down on job searching. I am cutting it down to 1–2 hours in the late afternoon. Instead, I’m going to focus on developing the one thing I have control over…my coding skills. If you want a little more background about me, check out the start of the series. https://medium.com/@mcgeehee/series-on-waiting-for-the-job-7dc3c16097fdThis series will document my daily routine and progress up until I land the job. It’s an accountability blog, a progress tracker, and a way to say “keep going.”DAY 2/3:So I missed blogging this series the last two days because I received an email two days ago in the late morning from a company asking me to do a coding challenge. Oh, how things change so suddenly. I had written the previous night that I had no prospects for jobs, and then all of a sudden, I have a coding challenge. The drama guys! So I’ve spent the last couple of days working on the coding challenge. In my posts, I was going to let you all know what I did in the morning, afternoon, and evening each day, and this is what I did:Morning/Afternoon/Evening:Worked on a coding challenge from company X.I finally submitted it last night 🤞 , and today is Saturday. I don’t plan to do much coding today because I think I need the break so 🌴, instead of talking about my plans today, I will let you know how the coding challenge went.Coding Challenge:This was a pretty straightforward coding challenge, and I liked it because it used what I was most familiar with, unlike a challenge I had where I had to use PHP (which I’ve never used before). This one was plain Javascript and had to be. You couldn’t use any libraries, frameworks, or bootstrap. It was plain HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I had to take design files and match them.It was actually pretty fun because I enjoy matching design files. I also loved the challenge of it and getting to work on my Javascript skills. Ironically, the previous day, I started Javascript 30 by Wes Bos and had completed the first challenge. Completing that helped me with this.How Did I Do?Here’s what I think…..I was supposed to re-create the component, but it needed to be bug-free on several different browsers. It also had a mobile and larger screen view, but there was no direction on screen sizes. I could re-create the component pretty pixel perfect on the larger screen view, but I’m not totally sure how it will do in other browsers. I tried using a browser testing service, but you have to pay for several features, and the free service wasn’t working. So I don’t know how it will do, but I think everything I wrote should work cross-browser since I didn’t use any crazy syntax or language features.Now to the mobile versions….I decided to work non-mobile first since I started that way and found an article that suggested common media breaks, so I worked with those. I also had to add special icons made of pure CSS. In the end, I was able to get a mobile version to match the design file, but it definitely needs work as far as spacing and animation are concerned. On specific breakpoints, it works great. Fortunately, I was able to provide a Readme with the breakpoints I used, so I am hoping they stick to looking at those. Still, I found weird things happening when I went from mobile to desktop and back to mobile. I tried to account for this, but it was challenging. I’m not sure how extensive they’re going to look at it and test it, so I’m uncertain what grade I’ll get.As far as my code goes, I tried to add as many comments as possible and keep things clean and tidy, but I definitely think there’s some verbosity in my Javascript. My HTML was pretty clean and semantic, but my CSS leaves much to be desired. I was able to get it working, but I have a lot of work to improve my fluidity and conciseness with CSS.Timing….my time to completion was probably a lot longer than other folks. It took me a solid two days. I’m sure a more experienced developer would have done it in half a day.Overall how do I feel?At the end of the day, I submitted what I had. Overall, I feel pleased with myself for matching the design file and getting it done, but I’m not sure I’ll get the job. I think they might be looking for a more experienced developer. I did, though, enjoy the challenge and the chance to improve my skills, so, if nothing comes out of it, there’s at least that.Skills Worked on These Last Two Days:CSS, Javascript, HTML, WritingJob prospects: None.Job positive news: This coding challenge was positive!Takeaways:Improve my CSS and Javascript skills by continuing to create projects….I ordered a CSS book last night and plan to go through it to increase my CSS knowledge.Final Thoughts:Keep coding…Written byMcgeeheeI love to write and to learn new things.

 const toggle = () => setOpen(!dropdownOpen);  return (    <ButtonDropdown isOpen={dropdownOpen} toggle={toggle}>      <DropdownToggle caret>Button Dropdown</DropdownToggle>      <DropdownMenu>        <DropdownItem header>item 1</DropdownItem>        <DropdownItem disabled>item 2</DropdownItem>        <DropdownItem>item 3</DropdownItem>        <DropdownItem divider />        <DropdownItem>item 4</DropdownItem>      </DropdownMenu>    </ButtonDropdown>  );}to add the button dropdown.We add the ButtonDropdown component with the isOpen prop controlling when it’s open.toggle has the function to toggle the dropdown on or off.DropdownToggle has the dropdown toggle button.DropdownMenu has the dropdown menu.DropdownItem has the dropdown item.header makes an item styled as the header.disabled makes it disabled.divider adds a divider.caret adds the down arrow to the toggle button.We can change the color prop to change style of the button.For example, we can write:import React from ""react"";import {  ButtonDropdown,  DropdownToggle,  DropdownMenu,  DropdownItem} from ""reactstrap"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  const [dropdownOpen, setOpen] = React.useState(false);  const toggle = () => setOpen(!dropdownOpen);  return (    <ButtonDropdown isOpen={dropdownOpen} toggle={toggle}>      <DropdownToggle caret color=""primary"">        Button Dropdown      </DropdownToggle>      <DropdownMenu>        <DropdownItem header>item 1</DropdownItem>        <DropdownItem disabled>item 2</DropdownItem>        <DropdownItem>item 3</DropdownItem>        <DropdownItem divider />        <DropdownItem>item 4</DropdownItem>      </DropdownMenu>    </ButtonDropdown>  );}to add the color prop and set it to 'primary' .This will make the dropdown toggle button blue.Split Button DropdownsWe can add a split toggle button for the dropdown toggle.We can do that by adding a Button and DropdownToggle buttons.For example, we write:import React from ""react"";import {  ButtonDropdown,  DropdownToggle,  DropdownMenu,  DropdownItem,  Button} from ""reactstrap"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  const [dropdownOpen, setOpen] = React.useState(false);  const toggle = () => setOpen(!dropdownOpen);  return (    <ButtonDropdown isOpen={dropdownOpen} toggle={toggle}>      <Button id=""caret"" color=""primary"">        button      </Button>      <DropdownToggle caret color=""primary"" />      <DropdownMenu>        <DropdownItem header>Header</DropdownItem>        <DropdownItem disabled>Action</DropdownItem>        <DropdownItem>Another Action</DropdownItem>        <DropdownItem divider />        <DropdownItem>Another Action</DropdownItem>      </DropdownMenu>    </ButtonDropdown>  );}We add the ButtonDropdown component with the Button inside.Also, we have the DropdownToggle with the caret to show the down arrow.Now we can only click on the DropdownToggle to click the dropdown.SizingThe size of the dropdown toggle button can change.To change it, we use the size prop.For instance, we can write:import React from ""react"";import {  ButtonDropdown,  DropdownToggle,  DropdownMenu,  DropdownItem,  Button} from ""reactstrap"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  const [dropdownOpen, setOpen] = React.useState(false);  const toggle = () => setOpen(!dropdownOpen);  return (    <ButtonDropdown isOpen={dropdownOpen} toggle={toggle}>      <DropdownToggle caret size=""lg"">        Large Button      </DropdownToggle>      <DropdownMenu>        <DropdownItem> Action</DropdownItem>        <DropdownItem> Action</DropdownItem>      </DropdownMenu>    </ButtonDropdown>  );}We gave the size prop on the DropdownToggle set to lg to make it large.Also, we can set the toggle size to sm to make it small:import React from ""react"";import {  ButtonDropdown,  DropdownToggle,  DropdownMenu,  DropdownItem,  Button} from ""reactstrap"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  const [dropdownOpen, setOpen] = React.useState(false);  const toggle = () => setOpen(!dropdownOpen);  return (    <ButtonDropdown isOpen={dropdownOpen} toggle={toggle}>      <DropdownToggle caret size=""sm"">        Small Button      </DropdownToggle>      <DropdownMenu>        <DropdownItem> Action</DropdownItem>        <DropdownItem> Action</DropdownItem>      </DropdownMenu>    </ButtonDropdown>  );}Uncontrolled DropdownA button dropdown can be uncontrolled.We can import the UncontrolledButtonDropdown to add one:import React from ""react"";import {  UncontrolledButtonDropdown,  DropdownMenu,  DropdownItem,  DropdownToggle} from ""reactstrap"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  return (    <UncontrolledButtonDropdown>      <DropdownToggle caret>Dropdown</DropdownToggle>      <DropdownMenu>        <DropdownItem header>Action</DropdownItem>        <DropdownItem disabled>Action</DropdownItem>        <DropdownItem>Action</DropdownItem>        <DropdownItem divider />        <DropdownItem>Action</DropdownItem>      </DropdownMenu>    </UncontrolledButtonDropdown>  );}We use the UncontroleldButtonDropdown without any props.It’ll toggle the dropdown on and off without setting any props.If we don’t need to manipulate the dropdown programmatically then we can use this.Drop Direction VariationsThe menu can be displayed in any direction.It can show above the button, or to the right or left, in addition to being below the button.For instance, we can write:import React from ""react"";import {  ButtonDropdown,  DropdownMenu,  DropdownItem,  DropdownToggle} from ""reactstrap"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  const [isOpenLeft, setOpenLeft] = React.useState(false);  const [isOpenRight, setOpenRight] = React.useState(false);  const [isOpenUp, setOpenUp] = React.useState(false);const toggleLeft = () => setOpenLeft(!isOpenLeft);  const toggleRight = () => setOpenRight(!isOpenRight);  const toggleUp = () => setOpenUp(!isOpenUp);  return (    <>      <ButtonDropdown direction=""up"" isOpen={isOpenUp} toggle={toggleUp}>        <DropdownToggle caret>Dropup</DropdownToggle>        <DropdownMenu>          <DropdownItem>Another Action</DropdownItem>          <DropdownItem>Another Action</DropdownItem>        </DropdownMenu>      </ButtonDropdown>      <ButtonDropdown direction=""left"" isOpen={isOpenLeft} toggle={toggleLeft}>        <DropdownToggle caret>Dropleft</DropdownToggle>        <DropdownMenu>          <DropdownItem>Another Action</DropdownItem>          <DropdownItem>Another Action</DropdownItem>        </DropdownMenu>      </ButtonDropdown>      <ButtonDropdown        direction=""right""        isOpen={isOpenRight}        toggle={toggleRight}      >        <DropdownToggle caret>Dropright</DropdownToggle>        <DropdownMenu>          <DropdownItem>Another Action</DropdownItem>          <DropdownItem>Another Action</DropdownItem>        </DropdownMenu>      </ButtonDropdown>    </>  );}to add those varieties.We added the direction prop so that we change the menu orientation.Photo by Jonathan Mast on UnsplashConclusionButton dropdowns is a component that comes with Reactstrap.We can change the orientation and color of them.Written byJohn Au-YeungWeb developer.

Custom Log Monitoring service using Google Apps Script,https://medium.com/@ravsamhq/custom-log-monitoring-service-using-google-apps-script-628ed86d1b5a?source=tag_archive---------49-----------------------,"Google Apps Script,Automation,Web Development","Photo by Adolfo Félix on UnsplashIn this blog, we will talk about how can we set up our custom, serverless logging system using Google Apps Script and Google Docs. We will use Google Apps Script to handle the HTTP requests and other business logic. We will store our logs in Google Docs.ContentsCreating a Google DocWriting CodeDeploying as a Web AppResults1. Creating a Google DocFirst of all, we will create a new Google Doc at https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/ in which we will store our logs. We will get its ID that we will be using in our Google Apps Script project code.2. Writing CodeFirst, let us create a new Google Apps Script Project by going to https://script.google.com/home. Once we have created a new project, its time to write some code. Let us add the following code to our Main.gs file.function logEvent(eventString, eventType='info') {  // get google docs to store the logs  var body = DocumentApp.openById('google-docs-id').getBody();    // get current time  var time = new Date().toUTCString();    // create a log string  var log = time + "" - "" + eventString;    // add log string to the google docs  body.appendParagraph(log);}The above code is really simple. We have created a function logEvent(eventString, eventType=’info’) which takes in two parameters eventString, eventType(which we will be discussing later). In this function, we get the body of a Google Doc in which we will store our logs. After that, we create a new string that contains the current time and the event string and append this log to the body of our Google Doc. We can try to run our function manually to see if anything happens at all.It would be great if can color code our logs to identify the type of event just by looking at them. Let us modify the above code to the below code:function logEvent(eventString, eventType='info') {  // get google docs to store the logs  var body = DocumentApp.openById('google-docs-id').getBody();    // get current time  var time = new Date().toUTCString();    // create a log string  var log = time + "" - "" + eventString;    // add log string to the google docs  var par = body.appendParagraph(log);    var style = {};  style[DocumentApp.Attribute.FONT_SIZE] = 12;    // based on the event type choose the style  switch(eventType) {    case 'info':      style[DocumentApp.Attribute.FOREGROUND_COLOR] = '#0000ff';      break;        case 'success':      style[DocumentApp.Attribute.FOREGROUND_COLOR] = '#06ad00';      break;        case 'warning':      style[DocumentApp.Attribute.FOREGROUND_COLOR] = '#e67e00';      break;        case 'error':      style[DocumentApp.Attribute.FOREGROUND_COLOR] = '#ff0000';      break;        default:      style[DocumentApp.Attribute.FOREGROUND_COLOR] = '#000000'      break;  }  // apply the custom style the log string  par.setAttributes(style);}Based on the value of eventType, we apply the styling to our log string. By default, each new event is associated with the info type.3. Deploying as a Web AppWe are done with the core code of our script. The last step is to deploy our script as a Web App, which we can call from any type of application like React Web App or a Flutter App. Add the following function to the Main.js file.// handles the get request to the serverfunction doPost(e) {  try {    // get query parameters    var eventString = e.parameter['event_name'];    var eventType = e.parameter['event_type'];    // log the event    logEvent(eventString, eventType)    // return json success result    return ContentService          .createTextOutput(JSON.stringify({""result"": ""success""}))          .setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.JSON);    }  }  catch (e) {    // return json failure result    return ContentService          .createTextOutput(JSON.stringify({""result"": ""failure""}))          .setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.JSON);    }  }}The above code handles the post request made to the Google Apps Script. Based on the script execution, a JSON response is sent back which we can check in our application. Once this is done, we can deploy the script as a Web App and use the Web App URL is our application.ResultsLet us how well our custom serverless logging system works.Awesome! Those color codings make the logs user friendly. This kind of custom logging system can help us to debug our applications in production mode as well. We can also configure email or slack notification functionality for a particular kind of event so that our team gets notified of any irregularities in our applications. We hope you learned something new today.

Reactstrap — Badges and Breadcrumbs,https://medium.com/@hohanga/reactstrap-badges-and-breadcrumbs-40e92ffcacf?source=tag_archive---------50-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Natalie Scott on UnsplashReactstrap is a version Bootstrap made for React.It’s a set of React components that have Boostrap styles.In this article, we’ll look at how to add badges and breadcrumbs with Reactstrap.BadgesWe can add badges to display some content besides another piece of text.To add them, we use the Badge component:import React from ""react"";import { Badge } from ""reactstrap"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  return (    <div className=""App"">      <h1>        Heading <Badge color=""primary"">New</Badge>      </h1>      <h2>        Heading <Badge color=""primary"">New</Badge>      </h2>      <h3>        Heading <Badge color=""primary"">New</Badge>      </h3>      <h4>        Heading <Badge color=""primary"">New</Badge>      </h4>      <h5>        Heading <Badge color=""primary"">New</Badge>      </h5>      <h6>        Heading <Badge color=""primary"">New</Badge>      </h6>    </div>  );}We add badges in various heading tags.The color prop changes the color.The badges scale to the same size as the text beside it.Badges can be used for counters in buttons:import React from ""react"";import { Badge, Button } from ""reactstrap"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  return (    <div className=""App"">      <Button color=""primary"" outline>        messages <Badge color=""info"">100</Badge>      </Button>    </div>  );}We add the Badge in the button to display a number beside the button text.Contextual VariationsThere are many variations of badges.They have different colors.We can change the color prop:import React from ""react"";import { Badge } from ""reactstrap"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  return (    <div className=""App"">      <Badge color=""primary"">Primary</Badge>      <Badge color=""secondary"">Secondary</Badge>      <Badge color=""success"">Success</Badge>      <Badge color=""danger"">Danger</Badge>      <Badge color=""warning"">Warning</Badge>      <Badge color=""info"">Info</Badge>      <Badge color=""light"">Light</Badge>      <Badge color=""dark"">Dark</Badge>    </div>  );}We set the color prop to those choices to set the colors we want.PillsWe can make them rounded with the pill prop:import React from ""react"";import { Badge } from ""reactstrap"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  return (    <div className=""App"">      <Badge color=""primary"" pill>        Primary      </Badge>      <Badge color=""secondary"" pill>        Secondary      </Badge>      <Badge color=""success"" pill>        Success      </Badge>      <Badge color=""danger"" pill>        Danger      </Badge>      <Badge color=""warning"" pill>        Warning      </Badge>      <Badge color=""info"" pill>        Info      </Badge>      <Badge color=""light"" pill>        Light      </Badge>      <Badge color=""dark"" pill>        Dark      </Badge>    </div>  );}The pill prop make the border-radius rounder.LinksBadges can also have links.For example, we can write add the href prop to them:import React from ""react"";import { Badge } from ""reactstrap"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  return (    <div className=""App"">      <Badge href=""#"" color=""primary"">        Primary      </Badge>      <Badge href=""#"" color=""secondary"">        Secondary      </Badge>      <Badge href=""#"" color=""success"">        Success      </Badge>      <Badge href=""#"" color=""danger"">        Danger      </Badge>      <Badge href=""#"" color=""warning"">        Warning      </Badge>      <Badge href=""#"" color=""info"">        Info      </Badge>      <Badge href=""#"" color=""light"">        Light      </Badge>      <Badge href=""#"" color=""dark"">        Dark      </Badge>    </div>  );}The href prop goes in the Badge component.BreadcrumbsBreadcrumbs let us navigate to different pages by providing the links for the navigation hierarchy.To add it, we use the Breadcrumb and BreadcrumbItem components.For example, we write:import React from ""react"";import { Breadcrumb, BreadcrumbItem } from ""reactstrap"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  return (    <div className=""App"">      <Breadcrumb>        <BreadcrumbItem active>Home</BreadcrumbItem>      </Breadcrumb>      <Breadcrumb>        <BreadcrumbItem>          <a href=""#"">Home</a>        </BreadcrumbItem>        <BreadcrumbItem active>Profile</BreadcrumbItem>      </Breadcrumb>      <Breadcrumb>        <BreadcrumbItem>          <a href=""#"">Home</a>        </BreadcrumbItem>        <BreadcrumbItem>          <a href=""#"">Profile</a>        </BreadcrumbItem>        <BreadcrumbItem active>Setting</BreadcrumbItem>      </Breadcrumb>    </div>  );}The Breadcrumb component has the breadcrumb and BreadcrumbItem component has the breadcrumb item.The active prop makes an item active.If it’s active, then it shouldn’t have a link.Other props include tag to change the tag that the breadcrumb is rendered as.listTag is the tag that the breadcrumb list container are rendered as.BreadcrumItem also takes a tag prop to change the tag it’s rendered as.For example, we can write:import React from ""react"";import { Breadcrumb, BreadcrumbItem } from ""reactstrap"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  return (    <div className=""App"">      <Breadcrumb tag=""nav"" listTag=""div"">        <BreadcrumbItem tag=""a"" href=""#"">          Home        </BreadcrumbItem>        <BreadcrumbItem tag=""a"" href=""#"">          Profile        </BreadcrumbItem>        <BreadcrumbItem tag=""a"" href=""#"">          Settings        </BreadcrumbItem>        <BreadcrumbItem active tag=""span"">          Language        </BreadcrumbItem>      </Breadcrumb>    </div>  );}We set the tags to change the element they’re rendered as.Photo by Cesar Carlevarino Aragon on UnsplashConclusionReactstrap comes with components for badges and breadcrumbs.Written byJohn Au-YeungWeb developer.

Reactstrap — Button Groups,https://medium.com/@hohanga/reactstrap-button-groups-c5ebcb14edc9?source=tag_archive---------51-----------------------,"Programming,Web Development,Technology,Software Development,JavaScript","Photo by Hermes Rivera on UnsplashReactstrap is a version Bootstrap made for React.It’s a set of React components that have Boostrap styles.In this article, we’ll look at how to add button groups with Reactstrap.Button GroupsButton groups is a container for grouping buttons together.For example, we can write:import React from ""react"";import { Button, ButtonGroup } from ""reactstrap"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  return (    <>      <ButtonGroup>        <Button>Left</Button>        <Button>Middle</Button>        <Button>Right</Button>      </ButtonGroup>    </>  );}We add the ButtonGroup component with a few Button s inside.They’ll be displayed side by side without any gaps in between them.Button ToolbarTo group button groups, we can use the ButtonToolbar component.For instance, we can write:import React from ""react"";import { Button, ButtonGroup, ButtonToolbar } from ""reactstrap"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  return (    <>      <ButtonToolbar>        <ButtonGroup>          <Button>1</Button>          <Button>2</Button>          <Button>3</Button>        </ButtonGroup>        <ButtonGroup>          <Button>4</Button>          <Button>5</Button>          <Button>6</Button>        </ButtonGroup>        <ButtonGroup>          <Button>7</Button>          <Button>8</Button>          <Button>9</Button>        </ButtonGroup>      </ButtonToolbar>    </>  );}We put our ButtonGroups inside the ButtonToolbar .There won’t be any spaces between the button groups.SizingWe can change the sizing of the button group.To do that, we use the size prop.For example, we can write:import React from ""react"";import { Button, ButtonGroup } from ""reactstrap"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  return (    <>      <ButtonGroup size=""lg"">        <Button>foo</Button>        <Button>bar</Button>        <Button>baz</Button>      </ButtonGroup>      <ButtonGroup>        <Button>foo</Button>        <Button>bar</Button>        <Button>baz</Button>      </ButtonGroup>      <ButtonGroup size=""sm"">        <Button>foo</Button>        <Button>bar</Button>        <Button>baz</Button>      </ButtonGroup>    </>  );}We set size to lg to make the buttons large.And we set size to sm to make the buttons small.Omitting the size prop means we set the size to the default.NestingWe can nest ButtonDropdown s in ButtonGroup s.For example, we can write:import React from ""react"";import {  Button,  ButtonGroup,  ButtonDropdown,  DropdownToggle,  DropdownMenu,  DropdownItem} from ""reactstrap"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = React.useState(false);  const toggle = () => setIsOpen(!isOpen);  return (    <>      <ButtonGroup>        <Button>foo</Button>        <Button>bar</Button>        <ButtonDropdown isOpen={isOpen} toggle={toggle}>          <DropdownToggle caret>Dropdown</DropdownToggle>          <DropdownMenu>            <DropdownItem>Link</DropdownItem>            <DropdownItem>Link</DropdownItem>          </DropdownMenu>        </ButtonDropdown>      </ButtonGroup>    </>  );}We have the ButtonDropdown in our ButtonGroup .isOpen is the dropdown open state.toggle lets us toggle the dropdown open state.Vertical VariationWe can add the vertical prop to make the button group vertical.For example, we can write:import React from ""react"";import {  Button,  ButtonGroup,  ButtonDropdown,  DropdownToggle,  DropdownMenu,  DropdownItem} from ""reactstrap"";import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";export default function App() {  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = React.useState(false);  const toggle = () => setIsOpen(!isOpen);  return (    <>      <ButtonGroup vertical>        <Button>foo</Button>        <Button>bar</Button>        <ButtonDropdown isOpen={isOpen} toggle={toggle}>          <DropdownToggle caret>Dropdown</DropdownToggle>          <DropdownMenu>            <DropdownItem>Link</DropdownItem>            <DropdownItem>Link</DropdownItem>          </DropdownMenu>        </ButtonDropdown>      </ButtonGroup>    </>  );}to make the button group vertical.Photo by Taylor Kiser on UnsplashConclusionWe can add button groups to group buttons together.Also, we can add button toolbars to add button groups.Written byJohn Au-YeungWeb developer.

Blog Post 304,https://medium.com/@jayswilder/blog-post-304-3fbd114daa6b?source=tag_archive---------52-----------------------,"Coding,Web Development,Austin Coding Academy,Lubbock Coding Academy","Stuff to rememberWhat is “callback hell” and how can it be avoided? This is a big issue caused by coding with complex nested callbacks. Here, each and every callback takes an argument that is a result of the previous callbacks. In this manner, The code structure looks like a pyramid, making it difficult to read and maintain. Also, if there is an error in one function, then all other functions get affected. How to escape from a callback hell? JavaScript provides an easy way of escaping from a callback hell. This is done by event queue and promises. A promise is a returned object from any asynchronous function, to which callback methods can be added based on the previous function’s result. Promises use .then() method to call async callbacks. We can chain as many callbacks as we want and the order is also strictly maintained. Promises use .fetch() method to fetch an object from the network. It also uses .catch() method to catch any exception when any block fails. So these promises are put in event queue so that they don’t block subsequent JS code. Also once the results are returned, the event queue finishes its operations. There are also other helpful keywords and methods like async, wait, settimeout() to simplify and make better use of callbacks.What are “stubs” in Node.js? A small program routine that substitutes for a longer program which is possible to be loaded later or that is remotely located.What are “streams” in Node.JS? Streams are a way to handle reading/writing files, network communications, or any kind of end-to-end information exchange in an efficient wayWhat does “chaining” mean in Node.JS? It allows for chaining asynchronous functions. It has 2 modes you can use: parallel or serial. In parallel mode, it runs the async functions in parallel (this is a lie as nothing in parallel in node. js, but it will simply context switch based on I/O calls as any async stuff works in node).Explain “console” in Node.JS. Node. js console is a global object and is used to print different levels of messages to stdout and stderr. There are built-in methods to be used for printing informational, warning, and error messages.Explain exit codes in Node.JS. List out some exit codes. Node.js will normally exit with a 0 status code when no more async operations are pending. The following status codes are used in other cases:1. Uncaught Fatal Exception: There was an uncaught exception, and it was not handled by a domain or an ‘uncaughtException’ event handler.2. Unused (reserved by Bash for builtin misuse)3. Internal JavaScript Parse Error: The JavaScript source code internal in the Node.js bootstrapping process caused a parse error. This is extremely rare, and generally can only happen during development of Node.js itself.4. Internal JavaScript Evaluation Failure: The JavaScript source code internal in the Node.js bootstrapping process failed to return a function value when evaluated. This is extremely rare, and generally can only happen during development of Node.js itself.5. Fatal Error: There was a fatal unrecoverable error in V8. Typically a message will be printed to stderr with the prefix FATAL ERROR.What is the difference between cluster and non-cluster Index? A Clustered index is a type of index in which table records are physically reordered to match the index. A Non-Clustered index is a special type of index in which logical order of index does not match physical stored order of the rows on disk.What are user defined functions? What are all types of user defined functions? User-defined functions are routines that accept parameters, perform an action, such as a complex calculation, and return the result of that action as a value. 1. Function with no arguments and no return value 2. Function with no arguments and a return value 3. Function with arguments and no return value 4.

Interview Questions — ACA Week 1,https://medium.com/@robertdg96/interview-questions-aca-week-1-cbbf5e27a139?source=tag_archive---------53-----------------------,"Coding,Web Development,Austin Coding Academy","Describe one thing you’re learning in class today.I learned about SWITCH conditionals as an alternative for the basic IF ELSE conditional. This conditional works by checking the value of the switch statement and seeing which case (if any) it matches in the conditional. If a case match is found, it runs the block of code under that case and then “breaks” to move on to the next part of the code. If no case match is found it runs the default code block;What is the difference between == and === ?The double equals checks for equality between two values and returns either true or false depending whether or not the values are equal. However, unlike the triple equals, it does not check to make sure that the two values are of the same data type. This can result in the unintuitive answer of a number value like 3 being equal to a string value like ‘3’. This because the double equals sign see’s they are “sorta” equal and coerces the number 3 into a string three, resulting the statement being true. The triple equals sign means “strict equals” so it first checks to see if the data types are the same and they are not, it evaluates to false. It does not coerce certain values to match the data type of the other value.What is the value of foo? var foo = 10 + '20';Due to the fact that the two values being “added” together are of two different data types (number and string respectively), the numbers are are NOT summed to equal 30. Instead they are concatenated together like strings and the final value of foo is the string value ‘1020’.Describe what a terminal application is.A terminal application are applications that Git Bash, Command Terminal, and Powershell. These applications allow you to interact with t he command line interface and run commands on you computer to complete various tasks or complete various commands. Creating a new directory, navigation to a folder, and installing more traditional applications are examples of these commands.What is the ternary operator?A ternary operator is a shorthand way of writing conditional IF ELSE statements. The syntax first evaluates an expression and the uses “?” to check IF the expression is true and then “:” to represent ELSE. Here is an example…(age >= 21) ? ""You can drink!"" : ""You're too young."";However the syntax is not nearly a readable as the traditional IF ELSE conditional so use this format very intentionally and sparingly.What are some ways to ensure that your website design or web application is accessible and user-friendly?There are MANY ways to make a site more accessible and user-friendly. Just a few ways are….Clearly written headers and body textIntuitive layoutsCTAs with clear actionsAlternative text on images for those who are visually impairedColors with enough contrast to make text clearly legibleClear text hierarchy to reduce reading fatigueWhat are your favorite features of HTML5, and how have you implemented them in your front-end development projects?One of my favorite HTML5 features is semantic markup. These are tags such as “section”, “article”, “nav”, and “aside” (just to name a few), that allow you to very clearly show what kind of content exists in a particular section or where is exists on the page within an HTML file. Which by their nature can get confusing and are only laid out top to bottom. It’s also useful for accessibility tools like screen readers for the visually impaired because they can recognize these semantic elements and relay this information to the user. I try to use this as much as possible in my coding projects but I often find that CMS’s don't have a lot of support for these semantic tags.How do you structure your CSS and JavaScript to make it easier for other developers to work with?There are lots of ways to do this. Just a few I use are…Good spacing and indentationClear names for things like classes and functionsIncluding comments where appropriate to explain what a certain block of code doesIncluding a clear order of code snippets, especially with CSS, so that code applying to earlier parts of page are at the top and the opposite near the bottom.Including code that may be a bit redundant or unnecessary (like semicolons), so code it more readable. I find clarity is often times much more useful that a vague shorthand.What’s your process for addressing browser-specific rendering problems? Do you find that a certain browser is more challenging to work with than others?I test all of my projects on a variety of browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and IE. If any elements don't render properly on any of these browsers, I either will include additional lines of code for a specific browser, find another way to complete my goal, or as a last resort use polyfills. IE is easily the most difficult to work with but since the userbase is so small and Microsoft will stop supporting it next year, I tend to only put minimal effort into rectifying issues in this browser. Its not worth it to make a website worse in order to pander to a small minority of users. Safari is also a bit difficult as well since the engine is not as similar to Chromium as say Firefox.Austin Coding AcademyWritten byRobert GonzalezI am a marketing technology & front-end web development pro, servicing clients in the education and non-profit spheres.

Is it the absence of cleanliness, the inadequate layout design, or maybe the unhappy employees that deny helping?Now think what if people got that same sense when going to your business’s website — worrying, right? What is even worse, is that you may not even know how it is negatively affecting your business.Most of the time, business owners do not know what makes a website design have good or bad functionality. As a result, website user experience (UX) is often missed on businesses if they have not done the correct study.WHAT IS WEBSITE USER EXPERIENCE?In simple words, UX is the complete experience that a person has when visiting your website and how pleasurable it is for them to use. User experience can apply to all types of businesses, products, software, etc. But here, we’re exclusively looking at website user experience. Not to be confused with User Interface (UI) — which aims more on visuals and the “look” of your website — UX is a much wider topic. In the end, your website may seem to be great, but if it doesn’t have the comfort the user is looking for, they may still end up disappointed.WHAT MAKES FOR A GOOD WEBSITE USER EXPERIENCE?From the comfort of navigation, to the type of font you use, users will subconsciously take all of this in before giving it a thought to stay on your website. The process of building and work together of these factors is what we call user experience design. Establishing an engaging website design is essential for the success of your business, so awareness of user experience in web design is just as essential. Here are a few questions you’ll want to ask yourself about the user experience on your website design:1. Is it easy to use? Your website design should be simple to understand and to navigate. Users shouldn’t have any problems finding the information that they’re looking for and they shouldn’t have difficulty clicking on anything.2. Does it solve a problem? Your website design should identify who you are and how you can help them. You want to make sure it’s clear that you understand your audience and provide a clear path.3. Is it appealing? This goes without saying, but UX best practices also means your website design needs to be aesthetically pleasing. That means your page makes effective use of white space, typography, has a visual hierarchy, and all around is pleasant for your users to look at.4. Does it function well? Good website functionality goes beyond just “my website works.” It also means that pages load quickly, that images don’t take forever to show, that it’s mobile-friendly, has no broken links, etc.Wrapping UpThere is no doubt that digital landscape is growing with some of the excellent elements. It is thus offering a great opportunity to the users in the form of outstanding user experience. To elevate users’, experience a bit more, keep in mind to consider the above-mentioned points. Besides making those much-needed conversions, providing an outstanding user experience is another consideration that must be fulfilled with the development of a user-centric website.Written byCreateBytesCreateBytes is a design and development studio that creates intelligent Web and App Design fusioned with Art and Simplicity.. https://createbytes.com/Follow22 22 22 Ux EngineeringUX DesignTips And TricksWeb DevelopmentMore from CreateBytesFollowCreateBytes is a design and development studio that creates intelligent Web and App Design fusioned with Art and Simplicity.. https://createbytes.com/More From Medium6 books every designer should readRyan GonzalesNature by Design Part 3Georges Hattab in NightingaleA love letter to spreadsheetsMichelle Morrison in Dropbox DesignHow to Build an Enterprise UX Research Program: 9-Step Case StudyJohn Nicholson in MarketadeGrowing Over a Heart in RuinDan Edleson in Paper ArchitectureDesign systems are not just for designersJessica Adamson in ringcentral-uxHere’s 5 key steps to take in order to become a better designerGabriel ChekArchitectural Context Part 2: PerceptionTigran KhachatryanAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
N/A,https://medium.com/@kaichang_10778/%E9%97%9C%E6%96%BC-v8-garbage-collector-4ecd0017fbfe?source=tag_archive---------55-----------------------,"JavaScript,Chrome,V8,Garbage Collection,Web Development","Reference from: https://v8.dev/blog/trash-talkTaskGarbage Collector 會定期的做一些以下任務:1. Identify live/dead objects — 分辨物件是死是活2. Recycle/reuse the memory occupied by dead objects — 回收死掉的物件佔據的記憶體以重複使用3. Compact/defragment memory (optional) — 記憶體重組(不一定會做) (備註1)這些任務可以連續或是交錯執行，GC 會暫停 JavaScript 執行並在 main thread 做上述的任務，這會導致 main thread 卡頓跟延遲，也會降低資料吞吐量。Major GC (Full Mark-Compact)Major GC 主要分為三個階段: Marking 標記，Sweeping 清理，Compaction 重組Marking 標記找出哪些物件可以被收集是相當重要的步驟，GC 會透過 “reachability 可達” 為基準判定物件是否存活，表示在程式執行的當下，物件處於程式 ”可以” 跑得到的狀態時，該物件會被保留，反之會被回收。標記就是指尋找可達物件的步驟，GC 會從 root set, 也就是已知物件pointer 的集合，包含 execution stack 跟 global object，並順著指針尋找每個物件，標記該物件可達，並且會持續遞迴的執行這個步驟直到全部的物件都被標記。Sweeping 清理清理是將物件死亡後遺留下的記憶體空缺加入到一個名為 free-list 的資料結構中的步驟。一旦標記階段已經完成，GC 就會將這些無法抵達之物件的空缺加入到適當的 free-list 中。Free-list 會按照記憶體大小進行分配以利於快速搜尋，在未來我們需要配置記憶體時只需要在 free-list 中尋找適當大小的記憶體即可。Compaction 重組GC 會依照記憶體碎片化的程度決定要不要進行記憶體重組，就跟老電腦的硬碟重組差不多。我們將尚存的物件複製到其他當前未壓縮的頁面中，透過那頁的 free-list。這樣我就可以利用那些死掉物件遺留下來，細小又疏散的記憶體空缺。這裡有一個淺在問題是，當我們複製需要長期存活的物件非常多，我們需要付出較高的成本來複製物件，這就是為何我們只選擇重組碎片化程度最高的那幾頁，並且只對其他頁執行清理的動作。Generational LayoutHeap 在 V8 中被切作不同的區域，該區域叫 generation。主要分做兩區，一個叫 young generation (這邊會再細分作 “nursery” 跟 “intermediate” )，一個叫 old generation 。剛開始物件會被歸類在 nursery，假設在經過第一次 GC 後順利活下來的話，他們會成為 intermediate，假設他們再一次活下來的話，他們會進入 old generation 。在 garbage collection 裡有個重要的術語叫 “The Generational Hypothesis”，基本上就是在說大多數物件死得早。對於 GC 來看，多數物件被配置後會立刻變成無法抵達的狀態，這不是只有 V8 這樣做，而是大多數動態語言都是這樣。V8 的 generational heap layout 就是利用了物件生命週期的這個特徵，複製物件在 GC 期間是高開銷，但是因為我們知道只有極少的物件會在 GC 之後活下來，因為 “The Generational Hypothesis”，藉由只移動那些活下來的物件，其他的則會默認成垃圾。這表示我們的實際消耗是花在複製保留下來的物件，而非配置記憶體的數量。Minor GC (Scavenger)在 V8 有兩個 garbage collectors。Major GC 負責整個 heap 的垃圾，Minor GC (Scavenger) 就專門負責處理 young generation。V8 採用了名叫 “semi-space” 來設計 young generation，意思就是有一半的空間會空下來，以用於 evacuated 疏散。這個空間被叫做 “To-Space”，然後另一個空間叫做 “From-Space”。最差情況，每個物件會在這個階段存活時，我們就必須複製每個物件。還有我們會有一個額外的集合儲存了由老至新的references，這些是由一些指針從 old generation 指向 young generation 中的物件組成。比起每次清理都跑一遍整個 heap ，我們用了 write barriers 的方式來維持這個清單。當結合了 stack 跟 global ，我們會得知每個在young generation中的references，卻不用遍歷整個 old generation。evacuated 會將所有存活的物件移動至連續的記憶體區，這樣做的優點在於可以完整的移除死掉物件製造的記憶體空缺，然後我們交換這兩個空間。當這次GC 完成後，新的記憶體就可以配在From-Space中清空後的位置。接著我們很快的會用完 young generation 中的空間，並進入第二次GC，這次物件會被搬到 old generation 而不是 To-Space。最後一個步驟是更新被搬運的物件之指針，每個被複製過的物件會留下之前的 address ，用來把原本舊的 pointer 修改成新的。在這個 GC 我們實際就是做這三個事情，標記，疏散，更新指針。但這三個是交錯執行的並沒有一定的順序。Orinoco (V8’s garbage collector)Orinoco 專案為了讓 main thread 更有餘力，致力於採用 最新 且 最優 的 parallel, incremental and concurrent 技術來實現 GC。1. ParallelParallel 是指 main thread 跟 helper thread 幾乎在同一時間進行等量的工作，這依然屬於 ‘stop-the-world’ 方案，但是總暫停時間會依照 thread 的數量分割了。這是三個技術中最簡單的方案，因為 JS 暫停執行，所以只需要確保每條 thread 對每個物件的獲取是否同步即可。2. Incremental這是指 main thread 間歇性的進行某項作業，他將整個 GC 的工作拆做小等份來做。這會更加困難，因為這些間歇性工作的中間 JS 會執行，意即 heap 的狀態已經發生改變，可能會造成前功盡棄。且這麼做其實總共的 GC 時間並不會減少，事實上可能還會增加。但這麼做還是可以解決一個常見的問體 main thread latency。因為這讓 JS 也能間歇地去完成它的任務包含 回應 user input 或 animation。3. Concurrent這是指 main thread 一樣正常的在執行 JS，但 helper thread 會在背景執行 GC 工作。這是三者中最困難的，因為 JS heap 任何時間點都會發生改變。最經典的例子就是 main thread 跟 helper thread 同時對同個物件進行讀寫。但 Concurrent 的優勢就是 JS 不會停止執行，主要麻煩再如何處理 thread 之間的同步。State of GC in V8Scavenging現今，V8 在 young generation GC 使用 parallel thread 來分散其工作，每條 thread 會接收一定數量的 pointers，接著就是 evacuating 那些物件至 To-Space。當 Scavenging 試圖 evacuate 物件時必須透過 atomic 操作以保持同步，可能其他 helper 已經通過不同的路徑找到了相同的物件，並嘗試將其移動。無論哪個成功移動了物件，然後都會返回並更新 pointer。他會留下轉發 pointer 以便到達該物件的其他 helper 可以在找到其他pointer 時更新它們。為了快速對存活物件進行分配，Scavenging 使用 thread-local 分配 buffers。Major GCMajor GC 會從並發標記開始。隨著接近 heap 動態配置上限，標記任務就會開始。每個 helper 都具有一些需要追蹤的 pointers，並且它們可以標記每個找到的物件透過追蹤所有 reference。標記任務會在 JavaScript 於 main thread 上運行時同時在背景執行。當 helper 標記的同時，JavaScript 創建的新物件會透過 Write barriers (註2)進行追蹤。當並發標記結束或是程式達到 heap 動態配置上限時，main thread 會暫停並快速執行結束標記的工作。這就表示了 main thread 的總暫停時間，main thread 會再掃描 roots 一遍，確定所有物件已被標記，並與其他 helper 一起開始 compact 跟更新 pointer。並非所有頁面都會進行 compact，他們會使用之前提到的 free-list 來清理那些頁面。main thread 在暫停期間會並發 sweeping 工作。它們與並行 compact 任務和 main thread 同時運行，即使 JavaScript 在main thread 上運行，它們也可以繼續運行。Idle-time GCJS 並無法直接操作 garbage collector，但 V8 確實有個機制可以觸發 garbage collection。GC 可以發送 ‘Idle Tasks’ 。Chrome之類的 embedder 可能會具有一些空閒時間的概念。例如，在Chrome中，以每秒60幀的速度，瀏覽器大約需要16.6毫秒來渲染動畫的每一幀。如果動畫工作提早完成，Chrome可以選擇運行 GC 在下一幀之前執行一些任務。總結V8中的 garbage collector 已經發展了很長的時間了。向現有 GC 添加 parallel, incremental, concurrent 技術是一項多年的努力，但已經取得了回報，將大量工作移交給了background thread。它大大改善了暫停時間，延遲和頁面加載，使動畫，滾動和用戶交互更加順暢。Parallel Scavenger 減少約20％-50％ 在 main thread 中的 young generation GC 總時間，取決於負荷程度。Idle-time GC 可以使 Gmail 的 JavaScript 在 idle 時減少 45％ 記憶體用量。並發標記跟清理可以將重度使用 WebGL 的遊戲其停滯時間減少多達50％。但是這裡的工作還沒有完成。減少 GC 的暫停時間對於為用戶提供最佳的網絡體驗仍然很重要，我們正在研究更高級的技術。最重要的是，Blink（Chrome中的渲染器）還具有一個垃圾收集器（稱為Oilpan），我們正在努力改善兩個收集器之間的協作，並將一些新技術從Orinoco移植到 Oilpan。大多數開發人員在開發JavaScript程序時無需考慮GC，但是了解一些內部知識可以幫助您思考 memory 使用情況和有用的編程模式。例如，對於 V8 heap 的世代結構，從 GC 的角度來看，Short-lived objects 實際上非常便宜，因為我們效能消耗只會用在存活下來的物件。這些類型的模式適用於許多 GC 的語言，而不僅僅是JavaScript。備註:1. 記憶體需要重組的原因:隨著你使用越來越頻繁，資料會被分散在不連續空間中，而且隨著操作越久放的位置會越分散，最後要找一個資料就得要到很多不連續的空間去尋找，因此會減低效能。2.

Flask supports Python 3.5 and newer, Python 2.7, and PyPy. These…flask.palletsprojects.comAhora si …Empezamos importando la librería, y asignando la clase a una variable a la que luego usaremos los métodos de flask:from flask import Flaskapp = Flask(__name__)Como ya dije flask es un microframework muy ágil y rápido por lo que con unas simples lineas de código ya podemos crear nuestra primera ruta con la vista que ejecutará.@app.route('/')def home():  return 'Esta es mi primera app con Flask'En este caso usamos un decorador para usar el metodo route el cual recibe como parámetros el path de la ruta que queremos asignar que en este caso es ‘/’ , y la función o vista que se ejecutar al acceder a esta ruta que en este caso es la función home(), el cual retorna un cadena de texto que se mostrará en el navegador.Ahora para correr tu app e iniciar el servidor debes abrir la terminal si estas en Unix, o el cmd si estas en Windows, ubicarte en la carpeta y activar el entorno si es que creaste uno.En Linux o MacOs:$ export FLASK_APP=nombre_de_tu_archivo.py$ flask run * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/En Windows:C:\path\to\app>set FLASK_APP=nombre_de_tu_archivo.pyC:\path\to\app>flask run * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/En tu navegador debería verse así:Renderizar TemplatesObviamente si quieres crear una página web completa con Flask vas a tener que crear los templates con su respectiva estructura html y estilos con css.Para mostrarte como se pasa tu template a la app de Flask usare de ejemplo la ruta creada anteriormente y un archivo html muy básico para que te des una idea de como es esto:index.html :<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=""en""><head>    <meta charset=""UTF-8"">    <meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width, initial-    scale=1.0"">    <title>AppFlask</title></head><body>    <h1>Página principal del proyecto</h1></body></html>app.py :from flask import Flaskfrom flask import render_templateapp = Flask(__name__)@app.route('/')def home():  return render_template('index.html')Como ves solo tuvimos que importar el metodo render_template, el cual recibe como argumento la dirección de tu archivo html, como el archivo se encuentra en la misma carpeta solo tuvimos que poner el nombre.Argumentos por las rutasAlgo que también es muy fácil de hacer con flask es pasar variables a través de la ruta, como lo siguiente que pasamos el parámetro username.app.py :@app.route('/home/<username>')def home(username):  return render_template('index.html', username)Para luego usarlo en nuestro template así de fácil.index.html :<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=""en""><head>    <meta charset=""UTF-8"">    <meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width, initial-    scale=1.0"">    <title>AppFlask</title></head><body>    <h1>Página principal del proyecto</h1>    <h3>Parámetros de la ruta:</h3>    {% if username %}    <p>Bienvenido, {{username}}</p></body></html>Como ves, la sintáxis es simple y aparte de pasar variables de la vista también puedes usar condicionales y emplear otros atributos de python dentro del template.ConclusiónFlask es una herramienta muy fácil de aprender y es perfecta para aquellos que ya tienen un conocimiento básico de python y quieren usarlo para crear aplicaciones web.Con esto terminamos por hoy, tu siguiente paso debería ser crear algoritmos en las vistas y luego retornar los resultados al template para mostrarlos en el navegador.

Keep It Clean!,https://medium.com/@cindylouwho92/keep-it-clean-42ef83763fd8?source=tag_archive---------60-----------------------,"Coding,Web Development,JavaScript,Software Development,Software Engineering","Keeping Your Code Clean & DryMe, trying to figure out how to refactor my code without breaking everything.As a new programmer, one of the things I have struggled the most with is writing clean, concise code. The mark of a great programmer is being able to write code that works and does amazing things while simultaneously being succinct, easy to read, efficient, and clear.We all know how easy it is to get carried away when we are in the zone, hoping to just make things work before the deadline. Before we know it, we have 450 lines of code and zero idea as to which chunk of code does what. While the code might work, it’s a mess and very difficult to maintain — if we can’t read what we wrote, how do we expect others to read and understand what we did? And if none of us can read the mess of code, how can we debug it when issues arise?Your future co-workers if you don’t keep your code clean.This is where refactoring comes in. According to Refactoring Guru (an awesome resource for learning more about refactoring code), refactoring is the “systematic process of improving code without creating new functionality that can transform a mess into clean code and simple design”. In other words, it’s the process in which we edit and improve our existing code in order to make it cleaner and more readable.Pass the wisdom on.A good model to follow is the Red, Green, Refactor approach. In this approach, we can think of coding as three distinct phases. In the Red phase, we think about what we want to develop and write our tests. In the Green phase, we write code that makes our tests pass. In the Refactor phase, we refactor and improve our existing code.A few tips:Add notes to your code where it is needed in order to keep things clear for yourself and others. But also be weary of adding too many comments — this makes code hard to read and clunky.Test your code often as you refactor. Make sure your code still works as you need it to after you’ve refactored.Keep your code DRY — if you find yourself repeating a line of code more than 3 times, it’s time to abstract some of your code.EXTRACT. Keep your code in small, easy-to-handle chunks. If any of your functions are too long and convoluted, extract some of the code to a new function and within the original code, invoke the new function.Keep your variable and function names as descriptive, simple, and consistent as possible. This will help you figure out what is doing what in your code.Written byCindy KeiFullstack Software Engineer based in NYC.

In the time of this pandemic, there were many businesses that were run by the offline market and there were some businesses that went offline as well as online, due to which many people have benefited from their door-to-door service at this time.In today’s time, everyone is doing their business online because at this time everyone is using the internet to find answers to their questions and your website is the best suggestion to show your brand and business. Actually, after loading your website it takes some time to affect your visits. Being the owner of a business or brand, you should keep in mind that visitors stop after visiting your website. If your website displays the service provided by you correctly or who you are and what service you provide, then the visitors stop on your website.So what makes your website great? The answer to this question is not as solved as you think. Website designing is subjective, some people may like it and some people may suffer. The old way of designing a website no longer works. We need a new process to create a website that engages our users.It is all about the user.If you are a businessman then you should keep in mind that it is for the user, not for you. The user experience should be a top consideration for you. Your website should be simple and dynamic. You should always keep in mind that your digital content is your only opportunity to make an impression on the customer.Consider these figures:You have 10 seconds to leave a mark on your visitors to tell them what they can get by giving your websiteIf your website does not have contact information or a phone number, most visitors will steal your website.Many people expect to load a web page in 2 seconds or more in working time, but many people end up putting that website.Business Mana and Brands Owner need to make their business and brand online to meet the daily needs of the visitor and provide them with good services at home.

12 Must-Have Pages on Your Ecommerce Site,https://medium.com/@branderspro/12-must-have-pages-on-your-ecommerce-site-a50cd1c34c19?source=tag_archive---------66-----------------------,"E Commerce Website Design,Website Design,Ecommerce,Web Design,Web Development","No doubt that the quality of a product is essential for business success, but it’s not its sole determiner. When addressing ecommerce in this context a website design and its marketing would be not less but, perhaps, just as important a factor affecting prospective customers’ decision to buy.Here, we would like to focus on the ecommerce website design, namely its architecture — a chief generator of the online shopping experience and consequently the ecommerce business performance.The following are the 12 must-have pages on your ecommerce website.Landing PageYour ecommerce landing page is a storefront of your online business — it welcomes your customers by providing them with the most essential information and links to other pages on your website. The landing page is your key initial impression maker, the touchpoint for potential shoppers and engaging brand wrapper for repeat customers. It should be adapted to your specific audience, motivating your traffic to convert, and entice by both brilliant design and real value.Your ecommerce landing page may include sections like:· Unique value proposition· Featured products, or bestsellers· New arrivals· Recommended, or personalized items· Risk reducers, such as free shipping and returns· Loyalty program· Text or video contentCategory PageThis page is a display area of your online store where products can be browsed under specific categories. Since category page lists all your products it accounts for the majority of search traffic, thus playing an important role in conversion. Think of this page as the most precious asset of your ecommerce store — design, optimization (SEO), and sales-wise — that makes your customers’ journey smoother and website crawling better.Product PageThis is an ‘aisle shelf’ that stores an individual product and provides the information about it. The item of choice is perused and put into the cart here by clicking the “add to cart” button. Make sure to build the product page effectively and your conversion will skyrocket, because, functionally, your product page equals to your landing page, just on a smaller scale. It should be convincing enough to encourage browsers to add to cart and fully explain both the product and your business as not all the customers land right on your landing page when browsing. Thus, keep the page product-focused and brand-consistent, inspiring and confidence-boosting. The bottom line, the power of your product page makes or breaks your online store.CartThis is the page listing all the items that your customer wants to purchase. If you provide promo codes, this is a place where your customer can use them and also check the shipping cost to their location. The cart page is often overlooked in terms of design and functionality. However, merely listing the items and organizing an untended check out process is no longer sufficient. Having a clean, simple, intuitive design is essential to minimizing the cart abandonment rate as well as including customization options, the ability to purchase add-ons and the like.Search & Search Results eCommerce websites can’t do without a search functionality designed specifically for those who know exactly what they want and do not wish to waste their time wading through the web pages. Compared to other ecommerce website essentials, site search is the most overlooked function. But taking an extra effort to improve it can make a big difference, leading to happier shoppers who keep coming back and share their experience with others.Login/Create Account  Return and loyal customers expect to have their information kept for easy ordering. A personal account is also a great way to manage reward/loyalty programs. Additionally, a creative and attractive login page catches the attention of new visitors and helps increase your customer base. Most login pages include username, password, and a highlighted Call-To-Action button.FAQ PageThis is your space for answering the most frequent shoppers’ questions. The frequently asked questions (FAQ) page will tell your customers everything they need to know to browse your ecommerce website with comfort, saving you the time of dealing with repeated questions. Your answers should be a persuasive call for potential customers to take the necessary steps and buy whatever you’re selling.About us PageOftentimes, the about page is one of the most visited pages on any website. People do business with other people and wanting to learn about those behind the scenes is natural. This page gives a summary of who you are, your company history and what distinguishes you from the competition. The about page of your online store is your business’s story, a powerful pitch and a chance to make a great first impression and build a trustful relationship with your customers. Use it right.Contact PageYour contact page provides shoppers with the ways to get in touch with you. It might seem like ‘just another’ web page that often belongs to the list of the under-optimized website locations. Such neglect is a huge mistake though, because feedback is vital to customer service. The experience of your shoppers is where your assumptions about your website meet reality. Therefore, making it easy for your customers to reach you is a sure way to creating better customer experience and building trust.The ecommerce website is a contemporary mode of the in-store display. You should be continually changing and developing it, ensuring that your users have the best possible online shopping experience. Incorporating the 12 must-have pages into your ecommerce site will undoubtedly amplify your efforts in public outreach, ensuring your success in the highly competitive ecommerce landscape.Today, more than ever, high-quality website design is an essential business asset in ecommerce.Article by BRANDERS PROWritten byBrandersproFollowE Commerce Website DesignWebsite DesignEcommerceWeb DesignWeb DevelopmentMore from BrandersproFollowMore From MediumAuthenticity is the new Personal BrandLindsey Norton Stewart9 Ways To Use Blogging To Rank In Local SearchJayson DeMersBrands Need to Adjust to a Quarantine State of MindBennat Berger6 SEO Trends Of 2019 That You Should Know AboutAmarpreet Singh in BrandliticPeloton proves the value of building communityBarry W.

Common web design problems you probably don’t know,https://medium.com/@bhavitrabd/common-web-design-problems-you-probably-dont-know-4900d9c57b6d?source=tag_archive---------67-----------------------,"Web Design,Website Design,Web Development,Website,Web Design Mistakes","Having a poor website is not an advantage for your business, and you will only lose potential clients and visitors. Unfortunately, all small business owners or entrepreneurs make many mistakes while designing or compiling the website. They make their designs and formation to save the costing, but you need to choose the best website design & development company to get a professional look for your business promotion.Website designing deals with many factors, including aesthetic designs, smooth navigation, simple icons, and useful content.Don’t make it too loud· If you want to make your website running, then represent relevant commercial and professional information on your website.· If your potential clients or even regular visitors can’t get the main agenda of your venture, then they will leave the site within a few seconds of arriving.· So, the main page of your webpage should be brief and straightforward with a basic introduction.· Too many images, information, data may look confusing to the clients. Avoid clumsy and confusing designs.Don’t make it too less· Minimalism design is now in trend, and many people use it on their website designing. Sometimes minimalism is not a good option as it contains only images, not any valid information.· If you want to attract potential visitors, big images on your website can be harmful to a first impression. Your visitors want to know what your business is and how does it help you. Don’t rely on only images.Complicated designs· Many newcomers usually make these common mistakes, and they include various types of information on one webpage that looks clumsy and complicated.· Your complicated we design doesn’t attract your positional clients as it only raises confusion.· The confusing website is one that features various kinds of massive images, color patterns, and backgrounds. In a word, it looks awful as a business or commercial website.· This can happen when a web designer has no particular idea about the business or company or the brand.· Too many designs, colors, and patterns can ruin your website easily. When you are designing for your website, you should choose a smart look with sharp content.The idea of Call to action· Many designers make this mistake quite unknowingly. CTA is one of the importer gateways of your business.· It gives prominent guidelines to your visitors to do something, including- “Click here! ”Get a coupon! ”Learn more about this product!” etc. CTA works like guide your clients to get their required information detail.· CTA deals with actions and information that should be correctly provided. The designer should be sure enough that CTAs will be helpful to the visitors.· The designers make sure that CTA comprises and tells clients exactly what to do! Keep all formation and fill up forms minimum and give some minutes to stay on that particular page.Choosing the wrong Content· Content is another vital part of website designing, and it is also a crucial part of branding or promoting products.· Content is the essence of the website that tells visitors about the core part of the business and the products or services.· The designer should pay cautious attention to the fonts, color, and size of the page layout.· Typeface carried your brand value in addition to the actual words of the content, so it should be in an understandable and attractive font.Whitespace issue· Using whitespace is another challenging feature of web design. Using fair usage of whitespace attracts the readers or visitors.· Making large blocks with less content is the eye-pleasing and an eye-catching feature of the website.· Long-tail content should be break up where the designer can, and use visual features to represent the context where it is needed.· Content should always be updated, new, and correct otherwise, readers might be annoyed.Irrelevant Images· Photos and graphics play an integral part of the web design. Related images and high-quality graphic designs help to convey complicated thoughts easily without any text.· Many websites don’t have their reader base just because of low-quality and irrelevant images.Unseen Navigation· All readers and visitors want a fast navigation facility. As we live in an unstoppable world, people can’t wait to reload a page for minutes. For this reason, navigability plays a crucial role.· The navigation menu should be simple and easily controlled by the visitors. It is frustrating to find the menu option on the search bar.· A wrong navigational menu is highly unacceptable by the readers, and it is also harmful to the website owner.Written byBhavitra TechsolutionsWe are the NextGen web design company in BangladeshFollowWeb DesignWebsite DesignWeb DevelopmentWebsiteWeb Design MistakesMore from Bhavitra TechsolutionsFollowWe are the NextGen web design company in BangladeshMore From MediumThe A to Z Guide to Excellent SEO Using 16 Free ToolsAlex Tucker in Better MarketingHow To Crush Your Instagram FeedSPS DGTLNothing Happens Until the Sale is MadeDan Shipper in Better Programming3 Common Email Practices You Should RetireDavid O. in Better MarketingMicro-Influencers: Powering More Engagement for Your Brand with Less FollowersOwen DuffeyBuilding Your Audience Isn’t MagicMichael Thompson in Better MarketingA Case for Personal NewslettersMegan Holstein in Better MarketingQuit “targeting Millennials” and start “talking to people”Sean RubergAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
A little better every day,https://medium.com/@nickablack/a-little-better-every-day-d670f075aaa1?source=tag_archive---------68-----------------------,"Austincodingacademy,Lubbockcodingacademy,Coding,Web Development","With each day and each project, I push my understanding of the basics a little further. My HTML and CSS are not the prettiest but they are working. I decided to look into a boot camp like this to learn as a group and not on my own. And that has been the most beneficial part of this whole process so far. With enough time, I could learn to do this on my own. But learning along side of others that are doing the same helps all of us push our knowledge along faster. When one of us has a problem, the rest of us can give a solution. And each with their own idea of how. This kind of structure is so much more useful than doing it on my own. Not to mention, this industry isn’t a “I did it all by myself” kind of workplace. Working together is a part of our future, not just the present.Some of the things I’ve learned:The DOM. One of the most important structures in HTML to understand is the DOM or Document Object Model. This is the structure that a website is built upon. It works much like a family tree and is full of parents, siblings, and children. Even grand-children. The “document” is the father of all of them and represents the whole browser window that the web page lives inside. Typically, it’s first decedent will be the HTML tags within the page being viewed. And the HTML’s decedent will be things like the “head” tag and the “body” tag. And each of them will have their decedent tags, and they will have their own, and they may have their own. It creates this rich structure that lays out all the elements on a page. But more importantly, it give the developer a path to reach out and grab those elements. They can find them and style them all or some or none. With the right pseudo selector, they can change one but not its siblings or vise versa. Even JavaScript can reach into the DOM to affect elements in different ways. The DOM is more than a family tree, it is the family.Responsive design. Building a website that will react to the size of the window or screen is imperative today. The number of people who view websites on mobile devices increases more and more each year. Less than 10 years ago, it was a small percentage and responsive design wasn’t important. But as of this year, mobile web users have overtake and now hold 51% of the market. Now there is this divide. Websites designed for a large monitor are hard to use on a mobile device and often have features that don’t work. But design for mobile only and that site is tiny on a monitor. Responsive design using “@media” in the CSS allows us to create a site that reacts and changes as needed. On you desktop, it looks great. Big bold areas and fills your screen with content. On a tablet, that same site can rearrange, reshape, or remove content and keep it looking clean. Pull that site up on a phone, and it’s different again. Maybe it’s stacked with more collapsing menu. Maybe only the essential content is seen. But it’s clean. Designing like this can go in two ways. Design your content for the mobile browsers first. Set it up so the default styles and design works perfectly on a iPhone, android, or whatever. Then as they user moves up to larger screens, it reformats that information to better fit the area. Or it can the other way. Design for the desktop screen and respond to smaller screens. It depends more on the users you are trying to reach, but both methods can produce the same results.How I see coding. Right now, most coding is a jumbled mess in my head. I understand the ideas and most of the syntax. But putting it together in a document is like sorting through my junk drawer. I have to keep pushing things around until I find the one I’m looking for. “There’s the tape! Now where’s the scissors?” But with more and more practice, I’m getting that drawer organized a little better each time. Hopefully with enough time, it will feel more like a filing cabinet of ideas and not just a place to throw things that don’t have a home.Where do I see myself? This question comes up a lot. And it probably will for the rest of my life. But it’s a hard question. At least in the sense of knowing where I plan to go. Honestly, I don’t know right now. I’m just dipping my toes into the river of web development and coding. I won’t be able to see where this river goes until I jump all the way into it. But I have the advantage of splashing around in some of its streams beforehand. And I know those that have learned to navigate it already who are willing to be a guide. I don’t know what I’d like to do with what I’m learning. But I have my hobbies and preferences that may help guide me to something. Or I might just find a fork in the river that takes me somewhere new. Maybe it’s time to get a running start and jump into the middle.Written byNick BlackFollow1 1 1 AustincodingacademyLubbockcodingacademyCodingWeb DevelopmentMore from Nick BlackFollowMore From MediumBuild a Clean “Game of Life” App in Flutter Using Hexagonal Architecture and TDD: Part 2Romain Straet in The StartupCreate styled-components libraryKacper BrezdeńClean Code Applied to JavaScript — Part 2: VariablesCarlos Caballero in Better Programming20 Things That Are Good to Know When You Start Web DevelopingDaan in Better ProgrammingHow to Break Down a Class-ic ProgramRebecca Nguyen in The StartupCloudflare Workers @ Opendoor: Landing Page InfrastructureJosiah Grace in Open HouseRasa Chatbot, Node Red and web interfacing at speedCharles Copley in The Patient Experience Studio at CedarConfiguring Web Server on EC2 Instance Using Ansible in One ClickRaktim Midya in The StartupAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
"<strong class=""bt"">5 Essential UI Design Tips To Follow</strong>",https://medium.com/@adwebstudiouae015/5-essential-ui-design-tips-to-follow-59b27cb1af97?source=tag_archive---------69-----------------------,"Web Design,Web Development,Web Design Company,Web Development Company,Web Design Services","UI Design TipsWeb development is all that people are talking about nowadays. The hype is justified because having a substantial online presence is becoming a must for every business and every company. Speaking of which, you being here tells that you are working on the establishment of a website for your business. It is just that you are seeking help with the User Interface and want the Best Dubai Web Design company to take hold of your site’s design and make it look as good as possible.It’s good to put so much effort into your site’s design because it literally can make or break your online image. On the other hand, the process of creating beautiful, efficient, and usable UIs is quite time-consuming, but it’s worth the effort. Having a well-designed UI brings you several benefits, like:· Increased customer engagement· Lower customer support cost· Positive user experienceThe Best Tips To Improve Your Site’s UI:Web designing means making constant tweaks and revising the design again and again until it looks perfect to you. However, if you’ve got a good grip on UI designing, you’ll have to opt for some necessary tweaks to improve the visuals of your website.1. Your Elements Should Be Clearly Defined:If you want, you should be using multiple drop shadows or instead, opt for some subtle border to highlight the elements and make them appear appealing. Just make sure that there are no muddy shadows around the elements that you want to be focused on.Instead, try all you can to make them look sharper. This is a basic tip to improve the UI design of your website, and it really will make a difference once you fix it.2. Go For A Single Typeface Throughout The Design:People think that using different typefaces in their design will make the website look cooler, which is incorrect. When you are creating your artwork, the wiser thing to do is to stick with a single typeface as this will help you produce stronger and more consistent results, just the way you want.Using two typefaces in a design can create a mess, and it will look all crowded, which is the last thing you want on your website. What you can do instead is that you can use different weights, colors, and sizes to produce results as per your desire.3. Use 20pt For Long-Form Texts:For descriptions, blogs, and other such long-form texts, opt for 20pt. The pt you choose indeed depends on the typeface that’s being used by you. However, most of the popular typefaces work perfectly with the 20pt.Using 18pt will work for you, but again, it’s a little old-school which is why we’d suggest you give 20pt a try and see the results for yourself.4. Consistency In Feature Placement:We can’t stress enough on the fact that you are supposed to be consistent when placing features on your website. At the same time, you also have to pay attention to the UI and ensure that it looks right in place, all consistent throughout the entire product.For example, if you have your menu on top of one page, don’t misplace it on the second page and make sure that it’s still on top. You need to ensure that your users know where things are every time they visit your site. Rearranging the menu every time when your page loads can bring you a lot of trouble.5. Use Whitespace Properly:Whitespace, which is also referred to as “negative space” is always your friend when you are designing a website. However, you should use it in moderation or at least use it in a decent way where it looks appealing.The white space gives breathing space to your site’s design, and it also makes your content look polished.To Sum Up!With these necessary simple tweaks, you can see a whole other level of change in the UI of your website. Hiring a professional web design company like Adweb Studio would be the best option for you here as these people are experts and they know how to make your site’s UI stand out from the other ones.Written byAdWeb StudioDigital Marketing Company, Web Designing, Mobile App Development, Social Media Marketing https://www.adwebstudio.com/FollowWeb DesignWeb DevelopmentWeb Design CompanyWeb Development CompanyWeb Design ServicesMore from AdWeb StudioFollowDigital Marketing Company, Web Designing, Mobile App Development, Social Media Marketing https://www.adwebstudio.com/More From MediumLooking beyond technology and businessAnijo Mathew in The StartupCopenhagen- The City of Fairtale LifeVeronika XiaoPerfect is the Enemy of DoneStephanie Blucker in Microsoft DesignDesign and ethics: At what point is it ok for us to make decisions for our users?Camille Oudinot in Nerd For TechUX or UI, where to focus?Avinash Bussa in BootcampThe Data We Do Not See: An Interview with Giorgia LupiAlyssa Bell in NightingaleWhen design becomes a cargo cultMark Parnell in Designing AtlassianCase study: finding a place to rent should be easyCindy Sheng in BootcampAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
