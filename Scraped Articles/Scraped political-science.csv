Against All Hierarchies: Part One — Debating the Inevitability of Hierarchies,https://medium.com/@writings-on-anarchism/against-all-hierarchies-part-one-debating-the-inevitability-of-hierarchies-8501de917dce?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Anarchism,Political Science,Political Theory,Hierarchy,Anti Capitalism","Photo source here. As with human hierarchies, stones are unlikely to assemble themselves like this naturally but must be sorted into such a tiered structure.I would like to make three arguments:Organizations — whether corporations, government agencies, not-for-profits, universities, trade unions, or local businesses — tend toward the entrenchment of hierarchies. In itself, this argument is probably not controversial, as most of us are employed within one or more hierarchies, so we assume that such arrangements are natural.These hierarchies tend to coalesce around two supposedly different types of leaders: a. The “lifers” who make up the old guard, who jealously protect their privileges and remain conservatively wedded to maintaining “business as usual”; and b. the “new blood” that tries to shake things up and inspire those below them with their “visionary” leadership — in more “progressive” organizations, this is often coupled with a paternalistic concern for the “wellbeing” and “work-life” balance of employees.Neither type of leadership can permit the flowering of human creativity due to the power dynamics inherent in all hierarchies, coupled with the anxiety instilled by the precariousness of one’s position in the labour market. The second type of leadership, however, is more pernicious because it views its role as being centred around unleashing human creativity but remains unwilling to acknowledge material circumstances.The first two arguments are straightforward but deserve closer examination as they are essential to understanding the third argument. My main concern here is to demonstrate that the concept of “leadership” serves to legitimize unjust hierarchies. To do so, I will use this first essay to develop a construct of hierarchy, including justifications for the continued existence of hierarchies. The second essay will explore the different types of leadership, and the third essay will consider the nature of how leadership and hierarchies serve to inhibit human potential. A fourth will attempt to sketch out possible paths toward non-hierarchy.Defining HierarchyI am going to opt for a broad definition of hierarchy here, which is to say that a hierarchy is simply any structure, either formalized or informal and generally imagined as a pyramid, in which power flows downward from the top (e.g. in a firm, you might have a CEO ruling over a handful of directors who then oversee a larger handful of regional managers, and so forth). I opt for this broad definition for two reasons. One is that it is already an intuitive concept for the layperson, as everyone experiences hierarchies in a material sense, whether in the workplace or in society as a whole (such as when contending with various bureaucrats and elected officials who form part of some administrative structure). The second is in response to Gordon (2007, pp. 156–158), who points out that the term “hierarchy” is one-dimensional in that it describes the structure of unequal social relations (i.e. the more visible, formalized elements of a pyramid) but not so much the subtler ways in which cultural practices and attitudes towards racialized groups, queer-identifying people, and women reify relations of domination of more privileged groups over less privileged ones (and because you cannot change who you are, it is more difficult to escape domination than it is to climb to the top of a pyramid).For the purposes of these essays, I will contend that domination and hierarchy are not opposed concepts, so long as we think of hierarchy as any structure in which power flows from the top down, and make allowance for the existence of smaller hierarchies and sub-hierarchies that may exist within a larger structure. For example, power may flow formally within a firm from an executive down to a base of subordinates who cannot contend with this authority without facing disciplinary action or termination. However, power relationships can also exist informally, either through the formation of cliques or by the tendency of ideas from more dominant social groups to receive greater recognition and praise than those from less dominant social groups. For example, women may feel compelled to stay silent when working with men for fear of being perceived as overly talkative or even “bitchy”. Thus, the actions that individuals take and the words that individuals use are constantly tempered by a hyper-awareness of one’s place within a formal or informal hierarchy.Hierarchies Past and PresentAs Christopher Harman (2002) writes, hierarchy coexists with violence and greed as “natural” features of human behaviour in both the popular imagination and in the writings of countless intellectuals, the latter using terms like the “sociobiological imperative” and the “selfish gene” to give a veneer of scientific credibility to explanations of the brutality that has marked recorded human history. Yet both archaeological studies of the distant past and anthropological studies of so-called “primitive” societies that have persisted into the recent past or even present have shown that 95 percent of human history (that is, stretching back over 100,000 years to the emergence of homo sapiens) cannot be characterized by forms of behaviour ascribed to “human nature”. Until 5000 years ago (and in many parts of the world up until the last century or so), people lived in small kinship-based groups “in which the core institutions of economic life included collective or common ownership of land and resources, generalised reciprocity in the distribution of food, and relatively egalitarian political relations” (3).The development of hierarchy is easier to explain in some cases than in others. The most blatantly pyramid-like hierarchies developed historically when societies shifted from nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyles to agricultural systems centred around grain and rice cultivation. Whoever controlled large swathes of fertile land, drainage systems, and the means of storing the crops — by forging bronze and later iron weapons and then “protecting” farm assets in exchange for a taxation on these crops — exerted outsized influence on those who performed most of the labour in the fields. This led to increasingly complex bureaucracies of administrative officials who performed censuses and counted coppers, a priesthood that served as an intermediary between the people and the gods, a warrior class of which its more powerful members often owned parcels of land on which the labour was performed, and the investment of divinely-appointed (and therefore unquestionable) authority in a sole individual, a king who in reality had seized power through force or treachery or was a descendant of someone who had done so. The labourers and serfs who made up most of the population had little social mobility, and could be expected to serve as fodder in whatever wars of conquest were waged by their king without their consent.The exact makeup of this hierarchy differed by locale and time period, and sometimes the king was replaced by a ruler elected by those at the top of the pyramid, but this basic structure arguably persists today, only rendered less visible by the language and logic of the “free market”. The top tier of the pyramid is now a complex web of multinational corporations, investors and financiers, lobby groups, political action committees, and government and university institutions. All of these institutions are made up of ladder-climbing opportunists who are either in the pocket of someone else or have someone in their pocket, or a mix of both. The bottom tiers of the pyramid are made up of various members of the working class, with those of the dominant social groups (typically lighter-skinned, even in non-white countries) sitting higher up than those who come from more marginalized backgrounds. Hierarchies thus exist on a spectrum, with those with money, light skin, with white-collar jobs and who are heterosexual and male sitting on one end, and those with any combination of little money, darker skin, a labouring job, and who are female and/or identify along the LGBTQ2S+ spectrum as sitting on the other end. This hierarchy is replicated on a global scale as Western (and increasingly Chinese) corporations extract natural resources and cheap labour from the global South, backed up by the threat of military force, debt to banks in the global North, and the possibility of CIA-instigated coups. Thus, the world’s richest one percent own 44 percent of the world’s wealth, while the bottom 56.6 percent of the world’s population own less than two percent of the world’s wealth (source).The existence of these hierarchies is justified philosophically by two concepts, that of the “free market” and “meritocracy”. It is difficult to have conversations on wealth inequality and social privilege precisely because of the engrained societal belief that all individuals have equal opportunity to succeed, and that those who are successful have “merited” their success through skills and hard work. Thus, it becomes easy for the “temporarily-embarrassed millionaires” of the working class to believe that wealth and privilege are within anyone’s grasp, and to dismiss anyone who questions otherwise as lazy, entitled, or possessing a poor attitude.The logic of the free market, however, dictates that the most efficient forms of work productivity should become the most dominant. However, organizations (I will use the term “firm” as a shorthand) do not act as free markets internally, and in fact are heavily planned and subject to centralized planning decisions made by a few people at the top, and whose decisions then trickle down to middle managers and heads of localized departments and franchises. The workers typically have no say in the decision-making process and have little room to express their creativity or ingenuity, as they have been conditioned to keep their heads down and tow the company line, and have no opportunity to raise concerns directly to upper management, but must instead communicate with an immediate supervisor who is either a victim of apathy and unlikely to care, or a corporate ladder climber who is more concerned with impressing their superiors than responding to the needs of those under their wing. Workers who manage themselves with little to no hierarchy, particularly in the form of a cooperative but even in cases where workers are simply given more autonomy as part of a larger firm, are by many accounts happier and more productive, but worker self-management is a threat to shareholders, who prefer a subdued, underpaid workforce, and makes the bloated salaries of upper management more difficult to justify. Simply doing business with a cooperative implies a validation of alternative forms of worker organization and profit-sharing, and so it can be difficult for new cooperatives to even secure loans and investment. The reality, then, is that the market dictates not what is most efficient in terms of productivity but what generates the greatest share of profits for shareholders. This is why companies conspire with governments to institute wage rollbacks, eliminate worker protection laws and curtail the power of unions, and why conservative think tanks drawing intellectual prestige from university affiliations and media organizations receiving billions of dollars in advertising revenues will repeat tropes about greedy unions, welfare queens, job-killing minimum wages, and the power of trickle-down economics.Of course, hierarchies extend to institutions that supposedly exist outside of the world of competitive firms. Academia is another prime case of hierarchy masked as meritocracy, in which the more brilliant researchers amass funding from grants and see their years of research manifest into papers published in the most prestigious journals. One author makes the case for written scientific communication as one of the few modes in which hierarchies do not persist: nobody can interrupt you as they can when you are speaking, there are no visible power dynamics based on gender, age, or body language, and anyone who wishes to contend with your ideas must do so through the peer review process. Yet to even be able to conduct research at all requires the budding academic to impress mentors who are willing to guide the work and funders who are willing to put any kind of money toward it. This may be fair enough, you could argue, as time and money is limited and no one should be forced to associate themselves with any particular research projects or academics. Yet it is difficult to reconcile the tension between academic freedom and the financial and interpersonal ties between universities, government agencies, corporations, and militaries. If, for example, a major oil and gas corporation donates generously to a university, even to the point of having buildings and departments on campus named after it, how can we trust that all sorts of interesting research into the effects of climate change is not getting shut down all the time, but happening so subtly and informally that it is scarcely noticed at all? The student is beneath the professor, but the professor is beneath a department chair who is beneath a faculty head who is beneath a university executive, who is ultimately bound to a board of directors, government bodies and external funders, and questions of securing funding, tenure, and future promotion within and without the university are intricately tied to what kind of research is conducted and its potential to either showcase the university’s commitment to research excellence or curry disfavour with funders. Compounding this is the fact that academia in Western countries is still dominated by white men, many of whom became tenured decades ago when there was less competition from women and diverse segments of the population and less prominence of underpaid, temporary contract work; in order to advance their own careers, the latter must choose between quietly humouring the microaggressions of the former or vocally asserting their autonomy and right to be taken seriously at the risk of harming their career.Are Hierarchies Inevitable?There are two reasons to argue for the inevitability of hierarchies. One is that, even in situations where no formalized hierarchy exists (it could be something as simple as a group school project, something as absurd as Survivor, or the spontaneous ways in which people come together to provide disaster relief in their community), there will be a tendency for cliques to form and for some individuals to naturally take on leadership roles to help steer the effort away from failure. The second reason naturally flows from the first: the complexity of tasks required to make everything from a group project to society as a whole work requires specialization of skills and the division of labour — and, of course, coordinator roles for a select few, appointed or self-appointed, who have the vision to guide this division of labour towards meeting a goal or making a product that is greater than the sum of its parts. On Survivor, these self-appointed leaders usually get voted off as soon as possible. Outside of the world of reality shows, however, the division of labour and the logic of leadership necessitates the predominance of “benevolent dictators” who are tasked with deciding what is best for the greater good. After all, if everyone was equal, there would be a lot more time wasted on meetings and debates (with so many participants that few would have the opportunity to make meaningful arguments) about what actions to take, how to implement them, and who would do so!I concede that there is little beyond hypothetical arguments to suggest that avoiding hierarchies is possible or even desirable. Even anarchist theory, which generally posits that all forms of hierarchy and authority are bad in that they legitimize the harm done by those with power to those without, must grapple with the question of “justified” authority (for example, does a parent have justified authority over a child? Or a timelier example for 2020: should an elected body have the right to mandate mask-wearing to protect the public during a pandemic? In other words, should we defer to “experts”, and if so, should we grant them some level of authority on matters in which the general public lacks the knowledge and training to even profess a meaningful opinion?). To make a blanket statement that any form of hierarchy is immoral is to invite eye-rolling for one’s lack of pragmatism about reality. The closest example that we can probably find to non-hierarchical forms of organization would be some protest sites, communes, and various squatting encampments (at least those without visible leaders). As the recent Black Lives Matter protests have shown, people from diverse backgrounds can come together, hash out priorities and plans, coordinate defensive actions and running battles against police, provide medical aid to the wounded on the fly, document police brutality and disseminate information about danger zones using word of mouth and the power of mobile phones and social media. Yet as these protest sites and activities tend to be temporary and subject to harassment from law enforcement and must rely on donations and active work from supporters to survive, it is difficult to use them as case studies to either endorse or indict “horizontal” forms of organizing (Yet is precisely in these struggles that anarchist theory locates the tendency of qualities and abilities that have laid dormant or been repressed under hierarchy to suddenly flourish — I will further explore this actualization of one’s humanity later in this series).These examples are probably too small and sporadic to hold much relevance for anyone interested in the potential for permanent, formalized, non-hierarchical forms of organization. Anarchist theory (particularly anarcho-syndicalist theory) provides the clearest way forward here by arguing for federalism — i.e. the coordination between smaller, localized bodies who make decisions as a collective. Some basis for this already exists in the federated organization of trade unions; locals vote on decisions that affect their own unit (such as paying for arbitration for a member who has been terminated from their employment) or those that affect locals elsewhere (such as allocating funds to support the strike of another local, or even engaging in a solidarity strike). Unions have their own issues with hierarchy and bureaucracy (and as with any institution, anti-progressive attitudes on the part of individual members), and it is easy to get jaded about conservative leadership that resists disrupting its often-cozy relationship with management. Yet in terms of formalized organization that enables individuals to participate in decision-making in a meaningful way that allows them to decide on how best to help out one another while also deciding on strategic questions regarding the production, allocation, and trade of goods, I would suggest a federated system that combines the workers’ self-management of cooperatives and the consensus-based decision-making power of unions as a path forward toward non-hierarchy.I will return to the question of how such a form of organization could avoid issues of dominance and hierarchy in a later essay but first, it will be necessary to consider the nature of leadership and those who are naturally drawn to leadership roles, the justifications for leadership, and whether or not leaders are considered as inherently bad from a non-hierarchical perspective. This is the focus of the next essay.Part Two can be found here.ReferencesGordon, Uri. 2007. Anarchism and Political Theory: Contemporary Problems. University of Oxford.Harman, C. 2002.

"Man is Born Free, and Everywhere He is in Chains",https://medium.com/digital-republic-of-letters/man-is-born-free-and-everywhere-he-is-in-chains-410e7a1efdde?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Philosophy,Politics,Society,Culture,Political Science","Portrait of Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1766), painted by Allan RamsayThe torch of Enlightenment shone, dimly at first, but firmly in the midst of the eighteenth century. The stultifying Old Regime authorities and decadent Parisian elites clashed to form an uneasy powder key of an environment in the French capital during the decades preceding the cataclysmic French Revolution. The Genevan philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778) was acutely aware of his outsider status among the largely French intellectuals who dominated the cafes and salons. He referred to himself as ‘Citizen of Geneva’ on the title page of his famous Social Contract (1762). Rousseau was anti-authoritarian, but crafted a political philosophy which could (and was) usurped by authoritarians. He was a libertarian (in the philosophical sense) who would have clashed with free market libertarians a great deal. His political philosophy, it seems, was an exploration in how to, if possible, craft a society so as to avoid the corrupting nature of cosmopolitan decadence and uphold and cultivate the great virtues. Additionally, the book explores the nature of political power as well as what constitutes legitimacy. The shackles of bureaucracy, of unquestioned tradition, and of extremes in inequality constitute a stultifying societal structure that has built up over time — a massive impediment to the power of the individual.Rousseau opened his magnum opus with the immortal words: “Man is born free; and everywhere he is in chains. One thinks himself the master of others, and still remains a greater slave than they.” His political philosophy, problematic thought it is, was an exploratory attempt to analyze the nature of authority and freedom — an Enlightenment inquiry consistent with notions of individualism. This work also builds upon key ideas Rousseau began to develop in his famous two discourses of the 1750s — one on the arts and sciences and the other on inequality. Rousseau set himself the rather impossible task of trying to reconcile individualism with notions of a general will in his Social Contract. Rousseau’s revolutionary idea — one of the most important aspects of his political philosophy — was that any kind of legitimate authority would have to justify itself. Hence, his emphasis on a general will — the collective will of a people in a (small) democracy. In the Social Contract, Rousseau had this to say:“As long as several men assembled together consider themselves as a single body, they have only one will which is directed towards their common preservation and general well-being. Then, all the animating forces of the state are vigorous and simple, and its principles are clear and luminous; it has no incompatible or conflicting interests; the common good makes itself so manifestly evident that only common sense is needed to discern it. Peace, unity and equality are the enemies of political sophistication. Upright and simple men are difficult to deceive precisely because of their simplicity; stratagems and clever arguments do not prevail upon them, they are not indeed subtle enough to be dupes. When we see among the happiest people in the world bands of peasants regulating the affairs of state under an oak tree, and always acting wisely, can we help feeling a certain contempt for the refinements of other nations, which employ so much skill and effort to make themselves at once illustrious and wretched?A state thus governed needs very few laws.”-Jean-Jacques Rousseau, from Book IV, Ch. 1 of On The Social ContractAs stated at the outset of this article, Rousseau was immensely proud of his Genevan heritage — calling himself ‘Citizen of Geneva’ in his books. Geneva, at the time, was a small, independent republic. There was much debate about the nature of republics and whether or not they could work on a large scale. This was discussed in great detail by the Founding Fathers of the United States in 1787 when they were designing a new federal government. Philosophers of previous decades took up the question of size and type of government as well. Rousseau spent much time considering nascent civilization and a hypothetical state of nature as a backdrop to exploring republican and democratic ideas. There are some, even in the present day (like Pete Buttigieg) who try to mash the two concepts together. Buttigieg actually stated in an interview with The Minimalists, that the difference between a republic and a democracy was academic. How wrong he is! The problematic nature of democracy in Rousseau’s Social Contract reveals a major difference — a democracy, in its pure form, is mob rule. Democracy killed Socrates and drove Aristotle into exile. Democracy can descend into chaos quite easily (as someone like Thomas Hobbes easily understood). Geneva was a small republic and its form of government worked well because of its size. Certain cantons and portions of cantons in Switzerland can function as direct democracies because of their size. Such government would descend into chaos in larger states. Unlike people like Buttigieg, Rousseau understood the difference between the two, though his use of the term general will did more to confuse rather than emphasize the distinction.Much of the chaos of the French Revolution was due to a massive over-valuation of democracy, the ability of politics to fix all of society’s problems, and reading (as well as misreadings) of Rousseau’s political philosophy as if it were gospel rather than the theoretical musings of an intelligent, but flawed, thinker. The success of English Common Law rests with the fact that it developed organically, through various gradual reforms (course corrections) over a vast amount of time rather than top-down interventions based on philosophical abstractions from people with little real experience in government.Rousseau’s Social Contract does have its gems. However, one must read the work a discerning mind. As the old adage goes, ‘democracy is two wolves and a sheep deciding what’s for dinner.’ At the same time, a republican government offers a much more healthy and appealing option for mixed government — one in which rule by one, rule by few, and rule by many can coexist and buttress one another. Rousseau’s best work, it seems, is to be found in his two discourses of the 1750s. His Social Contract, for all the hype it has received from many a political science professor, is an important but flawed work with a major important idea — the legitimacy of people’s sovereignty and several important related ideas — the dangers of bureaucracy, the centrality of liberty, critic of slavery, and the idea that small republican governments are the natural forms of government in which individual liberty can best flourish. The political mechanisms for creating such an environment proposed by Rousseau are far from perfect — it has all the markings of someone who had no real political experience. Thus, it would have needed a co-writer with years of political experience who could have shaped the inchoate and idealistic abstractions Rousseau was exploring.Rousseau also emphasized the centrality and inalienability of liberty:“Tranquility is found also in dungeons; but is that enough to make them desirable places to live in? To say that a man gives himself gratuitously, is to say what is absurd and inconceivable; such an act is null and illegitimate, from the mere fact that he who does it is out of his mind. To say the same of a whole people is to suppose a people of madmen; and madness creates no right. Even if each man could alienate himself, he could not alienate his children: they are born men and free; their liberty belongs to them, and no one but they has the right to dispose of it. Before they come to years of judgment, the father can, in their name, lay down conditions for their preservation and well-being, but he cannot give them irrevocably and without conditions: such a gift is contrary to the ends of nature, and exceeds the rights of paternity. It would therefore be necessary, in order to legitimize an arbitrary government, that in every generation the people should be in a position to accept or reject it; but, were this so, the government would be no longer arbitrary. To renounce liberty is to renounce being a man, to surrender the rights of humanity and even its duties. For him who renounces everything no indemnity is possible. Such a renunciation is incompatible with man’s nature; to remove all liberty from his will is to remove all morality from his acts. Finally, it is an empty and contradictory convention that sets up, on the one side, absolute authority, and, on the other, unlimited obedience.”-Jean-Jacques Rousseau, from On the Social Contract, Book I, Ch. 4.Rousseau was an outspoken defender of individual liberty and critic of the Atlantic Slave Trade. His statement above makes it clear that Rousseau’s political musings were of instrumental value whereas individual civil liberty is of intrinsic value. This point has to be made because of so many critics who saw in Rousseau’s ideas the precursors of twentieth century totalitarianism. This is probably because they focused so heavily on the specific political layout Rousseau delineated in the Social Contract rather than the thought process and values behind it or the previous works in which Rousseau explored the corrupting nature of cosmopolitan societies.“The very right to vote imposes on me the duty to instruct myself in public affair, however little influence my voice may have in them.” -Jean-Jacques Rousseau, from On the Social ContractStatements like the above are among the idealistic, well-sounding statements Rousseau made. The realities surrounding them, are a different matter. How many people in any population takes such notions seriously when voting? Yes, all adult citizens of a polity should have the right to vote and yes, they should consider deeply the weight that their modest voice has on the process. This latter point must be stressed because of the problems related to voter apathy and incumbent advantage. Voter apathy is a form of resignation, not the much-needed bulwark against the status quo. Incumbent advantage allows for the development of a non-hereditary form of aristocracy. Perhaps the example of San Marino — with their two captains-regent who serve for 6-month terms and have to wait so many years before occupying that office again — is the way to go in terms of executive power. In any event, Rousseau at least acknowledged the shortcomings of his more idealistic statement above:“As soon as any man says of the affairs of the State “What does it matter to me?” the State may be given up for lost.”-Jean-Jacques Rousseau, from On the Social ContractMan is born free, yet he is everywhere in chains. Rousseau’s statement still stands, even in societies which are far freer than Old Regime France. This is because, when one takes away authoritarian political impediments to liberty, there are many who yearn for some form of authority. Freedom is glorious but dangerous, even in a constrained form (in comparison with the state of nature). The artist, the entrepreneur, these are among the freest people in society today. They mold themselves into the people they wish to become. They take the initiative to develop themselves and exercise their liberty to the greatest extent possible while the vast majority seek pacifiers st their chains. It has been said that affluence is the precondition for existential angst. This is because the natural, antifragile nature of humanity cannot flourish in the superficial environment of middle class sterility. Rousseau’s political philosophy, in order to be more successful, must be taken into consideration alongside his critiques of both inequality and the arts and sciences. Otherwise, we risk merely replacing one set of chains with another.Digital Republic of LettersFree and Open Dialogue as the Ultimate form of Creative ExplorationFollow43 2 PhilosophyPoliticsSocietyCulturePolitical Science43 claps43 claps2 responsesWritten byKevin ShauFollowArtist | Content Creator | Pantheist | Bohemian | Philosopher | Juggler | Anti-Authoritarian, Pro-Decentralization/Localism| http://www.instagram.com/kevinshau/FollowDigital Republic of LettersFollowThis publication is for intellectuals interested in becoming part of a network building on the work of the Enlightenment Republic of Letters and Intellectual Dark WebFollowWritten byKevin ShauFollowArtist | Content Creator | Pantheist | Bohemian | Philosopher | Juggler | Anti-Authoritarian, Pro-Decentralization/Localism| http://www.instagram.com/kevinshau/Digital Republic of LettersFollowThis publication is for intellectuals interested in becoming part of a network building on the work of the Enlightenment Republic of Letters and Intellectual Dark WebMore From MediumHumanity’s Hidden Treasure: Unconditional AltruismWill Franks in Phoenix CollectiveSartre: The Origin of FreedomSteven Gambardella in The SophistThe Three Men Who Will Determine the Survival or Demise of HumanityThe Good Men Project in Equality Includes YouYou Can’t Have Compassion if You Don’t Believe in LuckPanpan WangFreedom Requires A Definition Before We Can Solve ItChristopher KellyI Don’t Blame You, I Blame Your SituationDalton Orvis in The Apeiron BlogWhat The Categorical Imperative Means For Your LifeRené Junge in ILLUMINATION-CuratedMathematical Structure and Vedanta PhilosophySasha ManuLearn more.Medium is an open platform where 170 million readers come to find insightful and dynamic thinking."
An Open Letter to Research and Degrowth,https://medium.com/@chris.jason.conrad/an-open-letter-to-research-degrowth-5dfe3934b096?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Degrowth,Postgrowth,Climate Change,Ecological Economics,Political Science","I’m an undergraduate political science student in the US. In the last year, I’ve consumed a huge chunk of literature on degrowth (probably 1500–2000 pages of books, journal articles, etc). I have deep respect and admiration for the work done by the folks at Research and Degrowth, and I fully believe degrowth (in the global north) is necessary and desirable. This is an open letter to the R&D community and others interested in post-growth economics that I’m writing as an unknown student, with the hopes that someone will hear, and just might listen.I know I’m not academically qualified to make the generalizations I make here — I may have a good GPA, but I’m no PhD, MA, BA, etc — I’m simply writing this letter as a hopeful student who has devoured degrowth literature, but have yet to find a chunk of it that answers the challenging question of how to make our dreams into a reality. On that note, here’s the letter:“Philosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it.”-MarxI want to make a simple argument.Research & Degrowth should shift trajectories, dramatically, as soon as possible. In what direction? Political science research, and direct organizing.Why?We are running out of time.The IPCC’s 2018 report on warming of 1.5 degrees sounded the alarm to the world: the world needs to cut emissions in half by 2030, and to net zero by 2050, to stay within 1.5 degrees C. In the global north, to compensate for its historically disproportionate role in driving emissions, emissions must go to net zero by 2030.Here’s the tough part.If the central thesis of degrowth is correct — that economic growth unavoidably drives ecological destruction and GHG emissions — then we have a little more than 9 years to win.We know that green growth is an impossible fantasy. Material use and emissions are tightly coupled to GDP, and studies that have modeled insane policy responses (a $573 carbon tax plus resource extraction tax) still find that if economic growth continues, material throughput will continue to rise, instead of falling to sustainable levels.In other words, we cannot stop the ecological crisis without degrowth becoming mainstream. And we only have 9 years (give or take) to avoid catastrophic harm (150 million dead from 2 degrees instead of 1.5 C).Degrowth is gaining followers, yes — in the 14 years since Schneider rode a donkey across France, the academic/research community has expanded significantly. But there’s a big gulf between where we are and where we need to be. We cannot afford to spend 14 more years in the ivory tower — we have 9 years to change the world’s opinion of growth (and possibly take down capitalism along the way)!This poses an incredible challenge — the Mont Pelerin Society took 30 years to mainstream neoliberalism, and it had the advantage of being in the interest of capital. Degrowth still has a long way to go, and wants to end capitalism (not exactly a recipe for securing billionaire Koch-brother sponsors!) Growthism is so entrenched that we still argue about whether degrowth is even the right word to use when communicating to the public. Even the furthest left parties see degrowth as politically toxic, they won’t touch it with a 10 foot pole.So, in summary: degrowth is ecologically necessary, but still is far from being mainstream politically acceptable. This must change, and very quickly.How?I have three tentative suggestions.First, degrowth’s research agenda should shift significant attention to questions of political science and sociology. We must ask (and answer) questions about how to win the battle of ideas, how to mobilize tens of millions of people into a social movement advocating degrowth, etc. Put simply, we must engage the vast political science/sociology research on social movement theory to chart ourselves a way to a degrowth world. Having read a significant cross section of the existing research on degrowth, I am struck by the lack of attention given to these questions.I suspect this is a product of degrowth’s intellectual heritage in ecological economics and political ecology — many of the academics have backgrounds in economics or ecology, not social movement theory. So it makes sense that the research has thus far neglected the challenging (but crucial!) question of how the hell we will convince the public to adopt our policy platform. But this must change if we want to have any shot at mainstreaming our ideas in time. I’m hoping to work on these questions for my senior thesis (and possibly if I take the MA program in Barcelona), but it might help if others (more qualified than I) would too.Second, it may be prudent to (partially) leave the ivory tower of academia. If the goal is to mainstream degrowth ideas, energy must be focused on spreading ideas publicly, rather than conducting research that never reaches the public eye. Put simply, greater emphasis should be placed on appealing to ordinary people and policymakers. Perhaps this means writing more books like Hickel’s Less is More or Raworth’s Doughnut Economics. Perhaps it means writing more op-eds for major media outlets, giving more public talks, etc. Perhaps it means securing greater funding for a dedicated think tank, or collaborating with existing progressive think tanks. Too little emphasis is currently placed on communicating to the public.Hopefully, the process of converting degrowth ideas from the language of academia to be publicly accessible will help clarify the many challenges with framing an idea as counterintuitive as degrowth for a general audience. Certainly, framing is another area within the political science/social movement theory umbrella that could use greater research attention (I wrote a paper on this subject that took an initial stab at the question, if you’re interested, it’s here).Third, real time and effort should be invested in organizing. If degrowth is to become mainstream, we must not only win the battle of ideas, we must help build a mass social movement to force politics to abandon the growth imperative.200 years of Marxist theory has not overturned capitalism. But partial victories against capital have been won. Crucially though, as Piketty’s most recent book documents, those victories (universal suffrage for non-property owners, the right to unionize, social democracy in parts of Europe) were the result of mobilization, not benevolent capitalists. Ideas matter, yes — but ideas are not enough. Action is required.To quote Mandela, “It always seems impossible until it’s done.” The end of slavery, universal suffrage, the right to unionize, gay marriage — at the beginning, these battles seemed unwinnable. But if history teaches us one lesson, it’s that social movements — ordinary people mobilizing to demand better — are unstoppable.The last 3 years have seen an unprecedented mobilization by new social movements to deal with the climate crisis (Extinction Rebellion, Sunrise, Fridays for the Future). I hope they win. But if green growth is a myth, then at some point, they will need to be ready to make the hard choice — ecological safety with degrowth, or climate catastrophe with growth.We must be ready to help them.Postscript: I know that many of the folks at R&D and others do devote significant time to public talks, and some to organizing (I met one scholar-activist of this mold when I spent a semester abroad in Copenhagen). And I recognize that the question of strategy has recently been raised at the Vienna Conference. My argument is that these things must be made a more core focus of the existing research/practice — I am not saying these things are not being done at all right now.Written byChristopher ConradFollow21 5 21 21 5 DegrowthPostgrowthClimate ChangeEcological EconomicsPolitical ScienceMore from Christopher ConradFollowMore From MediumFire Season is Year-Round: A New RealityNadin Brzezinski in Age of AwarenessGovernments Cannot Save the Environment.Christopher Balkaran in Strong and FreeSwapping Beef for Plant-Based Protein Could (Literally) Save LivesFast Company in Fast CompanyWhere Plastic Waste is GoldDr. Tracy A.

The Importance of Political Science,https://medium.com/the-innovation/the-importance-of-political-science-and-why-we-need-to-do-a-better-job-of-teaching-it-at-the-k-12-e7e026e89aee?source=tag_archive---------2-----------------------,"Education,Political Science,Politics","And why we need to do a better job of teaching it at the K-12 levelPhoto by NeONBRAND on UnsplashOur most basic civic duty is voting in elections. People fought and died for this right. So why is it that so many people today don’t vote? In 2016, 61.4% of citizens voted in the general election, which means that 38.6% of citizens did not vote in 2016. That is 124,716,600 people who did not vote. And it is not that they just don’t vote, they don’t participate in politics at all. And some people vote but don't participate past that ballot submission. They have no idea who their representatives are, how to find them, how to properly research issues and make informed decisions, how to pick candidates when voting, or how to reach out to their representatives with issues they feel strongly about. Why is that?Like most of the things we need to know as adults, it’s not taught in schools. People either have to learn from their families, figure it out for themselves, or go to college and get a degree in it. In a previous article — How Do We Ensure We’re On The Right Side Of History? — I called out people who ignore politics and say it’s “just not my thing,” and I stand by that. However, there’s something I didn’t touch on there that I want to focus on here. We have a group of people that ignore politics because they’ve never been forced to face it. We give every citizen the right to vote at age 18, but we do not provide them with the information, or rather the access to information, to vote for their interests. The reason incumbents have a 95% chance that they will be reelected is because the general population doesn’t have the time, resources, or general political knowledge to dig any deeper than what is driven down our throats. Incumbents have the funds and the reach to get their name out there and get it recognized so even if some have zero knowledge as to what that person stands for, we can see their name on that ballot and go “well things are going okay for me, so I guess I’ll just keep that person around.” And there are enough people in that group to push that candidate over the edge.This is not an accident.The people we have in power want to stay there, so we have an entire system of lawmakers, making it as hard as possible to find a reason to get rid of them. They are supposed to represent the public, but instead, they represent the elite. And when we do get someone in office that does represent us and what we stand for, we praise them for being amazing, but in reality, they are doing the job to the level and degree that every single lawmaker should be doing the job.Take Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for example, she is extremely popular — especially among young people — and many who don’t even live in her district have an invested interest in her career because she comes from a life we all know too well. She speaks up for the things we find outrageous. Every single person we vote into office should be like this because they are public servants. They are supposed to be serving us, but we’ve allowed them to steamroll us because we don’t know any better, and we don’t know any better because they don’t want us to.If I had received even a fraction of my knowledge about political science in my K-12 education instead of in college, my life, and many other people’s lives would be different. Our system would look so different if every single person were involved in politics. But don’t take my word for it, just look to the Civil Rights Movement, when so many people stood up and got involved that the government could no longer ignore the wishes of the public. When all of those people got together in the 1950s and 60s, we saw Brown v. Board of Education (1954) and (1955)— the start to ending segregation, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 — preventing the discrimination of race, color, sex, religion, or national origin in the eyes of an employer, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 — barring literacy tests from the list of voting requirements, the Fair Housing Act (Civil Rights Act of 1968) — providing equal housing opportunity regardless of race, religion or national origin, and so many other legal moves and cases. This movement was important and powerful but it should be like that all the time. We should not have to protest to make all changes happen. Protests are essential, but our system should not be so corrupt that we need to protest on a massive scale to get anything done.There are entire crowds that are so amazingly underrepresented at the polls, mostly due to the fact that they have no idea how to vote or who to vote for and they haven’t had the time or inclination to figure it out. Let’s start with the age groups, at this current moment the average age of the House of Representatives is 57.6 years old. The average age of the Senate is 62.9 years old. The youngest you can be to become a Representative is 25 — but we have only had one Representative get close to that age in our entire history and she was 29 years old when she took office. On top of that, 94.8% of House Members and 100% of Senators have bachelor’s degrees. For comparison, in 2016 only 33.4% of the general US population held bachelor’s degrees. And as for race, 23.6% of Congress members are something other than Caucasian. That means 76.4% of our Congress is white. And to make it even worse 75.8% of our Congress is men. This representation is pathetic and in no way represents what our country actually looks like.We need to do better than teaching whitewashed history in primary school and a class on politics in high school that kids can take as an elective. We need a structure of political classes throughout the whole K-12 line, teaching our future citizens the information they need to participate in politics the way that matches their beliefs. And these are our future citizens; we should not shield children from politics because they are too young, they should know what they’re getting into because this is the rest of their lives.Knowledge is power, and right now, we are keeping that knowledge out of the hands of the general population, and that is on purpose. That needs to end now.If we were to include political science into our K-12 system, we need to start right away. Elementary school should give a basic introduction into our political system. There are many people in this country that don’t know basic facts about our system. Here is a video of the general public answering some questions about our government. Most schools cover the three branches of government and their purpose sometime in high school, the first time I was introduced to our political set up was Freshman year of High School and we covered it in Civics and Geography, which was taught for one quarter — just over 2 months long. That certainly does not feel like enough exposure to me and that video mentioned above proves that it isn’t.Over the course of our elementary school education, we should have covered what the three branches of government are, the general concept of checks and balances, and an understanding of how government affects us at the most basic level, such as how all of our food has standards, and that their parents can only drive so fast on the road. An amazing resource for young children looking to understand our government and its history is Schoolhouse Rock. I’m Just a Bill and The Constitution are great examples of that resource if you want to check it out.By the time our children get to middle school, they should have a solid understanding of the basics and we can jump into application. We should be covering the specific responsibilities of the three branches — more than just writing laws, passing laws, and reviewing laws — and simulations are a great way to better understand how the system works. Have mock discussions about bills in Congress, go through what a voting day looks like for a caucus, use simulations to better explain delegates, super delegates, and how the electoral college works.High school is where more complex ideas and questions should come up. This would be a perfect time to bring up the fourth branch of government — the Administrative Branch, also known as the Bureaucracy — and a deep dive into the Supreme Court, remember that video from before? Not one person was able to name a single Supreme Court Justice, this would be a great time to fix that. And while we’re at it, talk about really important cases that aren’t as commonly known to the public, like Marbury v. Madison (1803) — created judicial review, Gideon v. Wainwright (1963) — created our right to counsel in court, and Griswold v. Connecticut (1965) — created the right to privacy in marriage. We should also talk about how the branches have to work together to enact the decisions of the Supreme Court. For example, after Brown v. Board of Education was decided, the President of the United States did not agree with what the Court decided and lent no help to assist with the enforcement of the decision. It took many years before that decision actually came to fruition and that they had a second Brown v. Board case a year later to help move it along. Here is some more information on the road to Brown.Not only should we cover the Supreme Court and its relationship with the other branches, but we should talk about how the government affects us on a more complex level, such as housing/building codes, the price of goods, and car regulations. Something I hear people say a lot is that the government doesn’t really affect them, well I have some bad news for those people. The government is involved in everything you do and it’s time we all knew that.Another thing we should absolutely cover is the “how-to’s” of politics. We need to teach the new generation how to research candidates, how to register to vote, what the voting process looks like — what do you do on voting day? — how to do absentee and mail-in ballots, and how to find good sources of information. There are so many groups of people out there manipulating information and facts that we need to give our citizens the tools they need to weed through all of it and pick the candidates that actually represent them and their values instead of the ones that say more than they do.One other major thing we should cover in high school is comparing our political system to that of other countries. We should know what other political options are out there. We should teach the difference between winner takes all and proportional representation, we should explain that our system isn’t actually a democracy, but instead a republic, and we should explain what that means and why that is. We are not giving our students and future citizens a wide enough lens on politics for them to understand what we’re doing well and what we need to improve on. We should look at countries like France, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, and Russia, and we should compare ourselves to them. We can’t be informed without all the information and if we incorporated these topics into the backbone of our K-12 system, our citizens would be so much better off and the hope for our country would be bright.The InnovationA place for variety of stories from different backgroundsFollow46 3 Sign up for The Innovation DigestBy The InnovationOfficial newsletter of The Innovation Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

How Couples Counseling Can Save the US (and Maybe the World),https://medium.com/@modernamericanleft/can-couples-counseling-save-our-republic-and-maybe-the-world-8b342a0f7a16?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"Election 2020,Biden,Congress,Political Science","Democrats can win in November AND repair serious structural damage to our Republic. Couples counseling shows us how.Polls from non-partisan research foundations like Pew clearly show over 90% of Americans distrust the federal government and want a better one.As a therapist and mediator who’s studied political science and social psychology, it occurred to me the strategy I use in order to help couples stop sniping and start talking could very well work to calm today’s political upheavals.It isn’t rocket science; basically five steps:Calm down to become less reactive,Show the other party you’ve heard them,Discuss a bird’s eye view of how you got to this point,Make concessions (generally starting by a commitment to stop destructive behaviors)Brain-storm a shared vision of future collaboration. During this phase folks sometimes make requests.Here goes:1. Calm down; become less reactiveWith a couple this happens through agreeing to sit down and commit to listening, breathing together, silence, stating intentions to repair the rift and move forward.Mr Trump and Co have made it quite clear they’re neither interested in calm nor repair. That makes this first step impossible, right? Not necessarily.There actually is a way -possibly the only way - for the opposing candidate to calm things but it means extracting one’s self from this 24/7 drama, what psychologist Stephen Karpman once called a “Dramatic Triangle”, a dynamic Mr Trump creates and re-creates daily.It goes like this: Mr Trump sets things up so he is either the Victim or the bro who saved the day.When he’s the Savior, the American people are the obvious victim and he rushes in to save us. He uses classic fear language by designating crushing enemies on the inside such as fake news, federal employees (his actual employees), socialist Americans and Democrats. If that weren’t enought then he tells us there are enemies on the outside wanting to harm us (asylum seekers, China, Mexico, immigrants).When he’s the Victim he wants pity from the American people, when he’s the Savior he wants admiration.This of course leaves one other role i.e. the Perpetrator, which, you guessed it, is the Democratic party.The Perpetrator’s path out of any triangle is relatively straight forward: a) recognize the dialogue’s been subverted through lies, exaggeration and hearsay, b) politely nod to the person doing the accusing but don’t reply, then c) pivot to the party depicted as the victim and simply do the opposite of flexing your muscles. Speak with warmth, with absolute truth and genuine conviction. In short: show us you’re determined to work hard to NOT be a dick.Let the banter and accusations bounce off you and maintain your focus on the dialogue with the American people; give us all your un-disturbed attention. Fall in love with us.The big bonus prize of pivoting?You go from a three-way triangle to a two-way conversation. Each time the third party tries to insert themselves, politely thank them then turn your back to them. You want to show the “Victim” they are not powerless and that you, the “Perpetrator” are not omnipotent and evil.get emotional — carefullyStudies show sincere passion attracts attention and lingers in our memories. Passion is made up of a combination of drive and emotion. The function of emotion (according to one school) is to say in big neon letters: “Hey!! This stuff is REALLY important to me. Pay attention!”.Too much anger in politics tends to push people away according to other research but feelings like sadness, fear, concern, admiration, pride, patriotism, and empathy pull us in, similar to the slow close-up when a person starts to tear up on a reality show.Donald Trump, (like all trolls and three year olds) likes to walk up to the line of Socially Unacceptable Things to Say, wait til the world is watching then put one toe over just to get a rise. That rise creates free advertising for his ideas. Look how we remember every one of them: from calling Mexicans murderers to insisting meteorologists are wrong about hurricanes. That’s emotion: from delight to abhorrence.The key to being the one who undoes the triangle: Be passionate about your story but not with angry rants against the preposterous notions bubbling out of the accuser’s mouth. Be passionate about the Republic; be passionate about doing the right thing for the American people. Be passionate about getting this crazy era behind us and getting back to normal.Be passionate by showing the American people that everything you have ever done in your entire life has prepared you for this very moment that you see as your final legacy before passing over to the other side.Does the loss of voting rights bring you to tears? Does lying in office make you so angry you want to spit? Do silly name-calling twit-sults make you roll your eyes with complete disdain? Be passionate about how these represent the cornerstones of our Republic: the right to vote, the oath of office, the importance of being the President of ALL Americans.NOTE: The moment your polite stance presents with an iota of sarcasm or anger at the accuser himself he will pounce on the words and repeat them copiously in public as proof positive he was right to designate you the evil perpetrator. Given the amount of energy Mr Trump actively puts into shaming his own constituents daily and inventing reality out of thin air you will probably never be able to out-drama him.2. Show the other party you’ve heard themIn my office once the intensity of the angry noise falls away and folks have calmed down I hear phrases like: “Okay I think I get it now! You REALLY don’t want to have a third child.” All they’ve done is simply hear what the other one wants and believes, then summarized it back.On a national scale: Since a candidate can’t have a discussion with all of the American people I decided to put together the portrait of “America’s ideal candidate” as a way to really hear what a majority of us is saying. I scanned scores of documents, polls and survey results, then cross-referenced them with other multiple sources. I dropped them into a spread sheet that got longer and longer. If you want to show the American people they’ve been heard, you look at their likes and dislikes, their dreams and aspirations.I sat down to read the outcomes of my research and I began to weep.I had bought into the lie : ask the 60%ersI think of myself — a quiet leftist in a centrist country — as a permanent political outlier. What a jolt it was for me to discover the platform a majority of Americans supports is actually not too distant from my own.But here’s the kicker: because I assumed the outcome of my research could easily be criticized I decided to be generous in my appraisals and give poll-haters the benefit of the doubt. I only retained outcomes of surveys with at least a SIXTY PERCENT agreement.That’s TEN percentage points more than the majority.In any Republic numbers matter. There are roughly 100 million registered voters. Ten percent translates into 10 million more registered voters who support the American platform, basically the population of all five boroughs of New York City.NOTE: The Republicans’ come-to-jesus analysis in 2012 when they lost the elections showed they needed to have more policies that worked for women, people of color and recent immigrants. They could have done the hard work of any democracy by explaining, convincing, persuading these groups of American voters supply-side policies with lower taxes and fewer social services will make their live’s better. Instead of investing into persuading, they chose the lazy path of diving straight into hysteria, disinformation and a refusal to even try to debate. This is the same familiar disdain the white male dominant class has always had toward young people, women, people of color and immigrants. Instead of acknowledging them as part of the electorate then trying to persuade them that your policies are good, you instead persuade a loud, virulent part of the electorate that the people with whom you should be charming as hell are actually the problem. It’s why Trump has to constantly remind the far right minority (Half the size of the rest of the population) he’s their guy. A little rally in Tulsa, cynically called on the exact anniversary of a white-on-black massacre anyone?So hold on to your hat. Here’s where the American people stand:93% think gender equity should be a government priority, 60% want to eliminate the Electoral College and have direct democracy, 76% want political discourse to be more fact-based, 85% want it to be more respectful, 77% believe immigrants are not more to blame for crime and 67% believe allowing them a path to citizenship is somewhat or very important. 77% percent of gun owners believe background checks should be mandatory, 82% believe sales should be blocked for anyone on a ‘watch list’. 68% of Americans believe lowering healthcare costs and providing a good education should be political priorities. 67% support Black Lives Matter, 93% believe a fair judiciary is VERY important. 66% believe it would be too risky to give the president more power. 70% believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases. 77% trust the WHO and 72% believe the UN is still needed, (72% believe we should pay our dues on time and in full). 80% think we should work with other countries rather than going it alone. 74% believe DACA folks should be granted legal status. 76% say that a church should not support a specific candidate. 66% of church-goers say they trust “believer” and “non-believer” politicians equally. 23% identify as evangelical Christian 72% say LGBT people should be treated equally.Here are three possible summaries to show the American people you’ve heard what they want and whether you agree or not you take their input seriously:A couple examples:“Some of us believe climate change is man-made. Some of us disagree with that. Either way 63% of us agree there’s a serious weather problem that needs to be a priority of the federal government. We are Americans. We have drive, creativity, entrepreneurship. Surely we can take a leadership role in what is going to have to be a global movement without being taken for a ride by false science. We have some of the best scientists in the world. We can use existing global institutions like the UN to collaborate with other countries so that no one country shares all the burden.Weather patterns don’t need a passport to cross borders. ”Or“I have heard arguments from many people for and against abortion. I know this is a very tricky topic for the American people but one we must be able to discuss openly, not just in a courtroom. On the one hand we want a human fetus to survive without pain and to blossom into a life full of potential. On the other the government’s job is to make sure healthcare is a) delivered safely and b) delivered equitably. My faith says that NO abortion is the right path. But I am not just a Christian I am also someone deeply committed to maintaining a strong, vibrant Republic. I have spoken with experts on both sides -including patients- and I know that it’s complicated and painful, sometimes physically but almost always emotionally. I just don’t see how we can be a country that supports freedom and liberty; a country that works as a safeguard for each individual so they can follow their pursuit of happiness then turn around and tell 52% of Americans they can have access to all medical procedures except one very specific one that offends a minority of Americans, mostly adherents of certain religions.”Or“I understand we’ve come to a point when Americans deeply distrust the federal government. I also understand many of you voted for Mr Trump because you really wanted to have a breath of fresh air in Washington. Even though I disagree with some of this administration’s policies I do see it was a worthy experiment in democracy to have a businessman run the executive branch. I think we’ve learned a lot about our government and her institutions in the last four years. We’ve also learned where some of the cracks lie in our institutions. They need cementing.”3. Discuss a bird’s eye view of how you got to this pointIn my office this is the part where couples start to say “We did start dating straight out of high school. Then you got that great job offer in …”. In short they piece together narratives of how they might have got to this place of turmoil.Three narratives of how we got here nationally:“For hundreds of years we wrote letters to each other on paper that was physically delivered to another person. In 2004 President Bush declared a shift to all digital. Suddenly over night we could send documents, pictures, sound and video all through the same cable. An entirely new world burst open — a world wide web. And it’s almost like we’ve discovered a new planet with its own language and customs, changing at breakneck speeds. This new planet impacts every corner of our life: banking, healthcare, dating, entertainment, travel, energy and the list goes on.Before we discuss why I think government should intervene in this industry let’s pause and celebrate. We humans invented a way for ALL of us on the planet to be connected! Over half of the 7 billion people on the planet have access and that number is growing.This is as big or bigger than the Wright brothers or going to the moon. Because the possibilities are endless.Nationally, we can use it to connect Americans to services and products they need not just from business but also government. Maybe we can use it to improve how we get citizen input into our lawmaking process.Globally we can start to organize solutions to global problems like viruses, strange weather patterns and new migrations caused by weather changes. We can open up new markets and get to know people from other countries.Think about it: the COVID epidemic is the first time in history we were able to see a virus arrive on our shores in real time and prepare for it. It’s not perfect yet but we can congratulate ourselves for having invented a tool that sends information at lightning speed.What if we could make learning about this new incredible invention and its many possible applications a priority for all Americans? Most people have learned to use the internet. But very few actually know how to build something with it; to turn it into a small business for themselves. And many of the big players who started with a clean slate are making it complicated for those following behind to create something online without going through them.We can both stimulate the growth of the internet and teach more Americans how to use it to the benefit of their family, their town, their faith community, their business or local sports team. But government needs to put in place something equivalent to the “Do Not Call” list for the internet and establish ways to distinguish friend from foe as well as rules to protect our data.”Or this one:“If we look at leaders in business, in Washington, in Hollywood a huge part of them are ‘Boomers’, people born right after World War 2. Their parents saw the horror of millions of people dying in Europe and created an agreement that had never been tried before: a treaty of non-aggression between 50 countries.As leaders of democracy we hosted the signing ceremony in San Francisco and promised all the countries New York would always be a safe space for the world headquarters. Basically all of the countries agreed to apply the idea of “One for all and all for one”. Today it’s an agreement between 180 countries.And it worked. For the last 80 years we’ve enjoyed incredible levels of peace. The Boomers grew our economy, mostly maintained that peace and kept our country vibrant. Violence in America and across the globe has continuously gone down. And education has gone up.Thanks to that peace, we’ve enjoyed incredible levels of prosperity, prosperity that made our country the richest in the world.Boomers were always the largest group of voters. In a country where the majority rules their voices have dominated business and government policies for decades.But here’s the rub: today the entire country is being held hostage in a fight between left and right-leaning Boomers which pretty much started in 1968, the last time we had race riots. One side is for American exceptionalism, Christians vs atheists, booming capitalism and few to no social services. They believe job creation is up to the market not government. The other side is for a robust but kinder form of capitalism that balances growth with more social services.Then along come the Zoomers: young people 26 and below. They are the most college educated and multi-ethnic generation in the US. They could use a keyboard before they could write with a pen. They are the first entire generation to be connected by internet to the world. And whether they identify as Republican or Democrat, they believe “problems can be solved through dialogue” (Pew Research, 2019).Zoomers have benefited from these decades of peace and prosperity as well and they engage with people from around the world through the internet. They believe climate change is man-made and needs to be addressed. They believe government’s job is to make the lives of Americans better. They believe corporations should be called out if they don’t behave ethically.Perhaps we can listen to the tension between Boomers who can’t seem to agree on anything AND we can listen to the generation born 7 decades later who have a real bipartisan vision for the future they can agree on.”And finally:“Seven years ago an economist predicted a massive chunk of money would flow up to the very top and the middle class would get smaller. He was right. He got there basically by studying two hundred and fifty years of economic data from several countries. (Piketty, 2013)There were three big take-aways from his research: the prosperity we experienced in the 50’s and 60’s was a glitch and not a feature. Growth started slowing down around 1970. Lastly when growth slows down history shows that folks with money keep it in the stock market and not in creating new jobs. Basically because they can make more money.Where does that leave the rest of us, those of us who don’t belong to the 160,000 families that make up the top 1%?Back in 1970 the average income of the top 1% was 26 times higher than the average income of the bottom 50%. Basically the richest 1% made 2600% more than the average 50% poorest Americans.Today they make 8100% more.Here’s the tragedy: the bottom 50% have basically not seen an increase in their average revenue since 1970. During that time Republicans were in the White House 64% of the time; twice as much as the democrats. Each time they got elected on the promise they’d bring back the high growth of the 1950’s and — basically- all make 3% interest on our savings account once again.If like the Supreme Court says money is speech then those 160K Americans are speaking 8100% louder than 150 million of us. Guess who gets heard in DC?4 — Make concessions, show good intent, mean it. (generally start with a commitment to stop any destructive behaviors)Each party in the couple begins to make “bids” in order to diminish any behaviors that are bad for the couple and if possible find ways to meet in the middle. It may look something like: “I promise I’ll never max out our credit card again. I’m going to ask you to hold it for a while”.In the case of the presidential candidate they can build more trust with the American people by offering to give up some of their power.For instance:“I promise on my first day in office, (and I really hope you will give me a chance to prove to you that I am a person who keeps their word): I will instruct the Justice Department to make it very clear the president can be arrested if he has committed a crime. We teach our children to take a time out if they cheat at a game. No reason the president should be treated differently. The constitution does not mince words on who is on deck to replace the president if he or she has to step down.”“I promise to shift responsibility of all Inspectors General over to the legislative branch. I think having inspectors keep us accountable is a great idea. But it just makes no sense to have the people who work for the president’s team in charge of investigating the president’s team.”“I will make sure lobbyists can no longer bribe legislators. We don’t need a Congress that costs you, the taxpayers, almost a billion dollars in payroll to only have them work half time because they have to spend the other half of their time constantly looking for donations. We know where the money is coming from. We know those people expect favors in return. We know the lobbying industry is thriving so it must be working.”“I promise to ask Congress on my first day in office for a law to make it a crime for me to hire my family and to profit from my personal business interests while I’m in office. I will ask them to create a law saying that every presidential candidate must share their tax returns to be sure there’s no conflict of interest.”“I promise to make it transparent to all of you who the people on my team at the White House are. I understand you do not elect them and yet we collectively hand them A LOT of power. I want you to be able to get to know them.”5 — Brain-storm a shared vision of how we can continue to work collaboratively in the future. (Sometimes this includes requests of the other party.)With couples this part is easy and fun. They’ve both put down their swords, they’ve agreed on some likely scenarios and explanations of how they got where they are and now they’re ready to start dreaming about the future together again.In our country this simply is not happening between the two parties in power. To me this is the biggest tragedy about the Boomer Hostage situation. If that forward-thinking visioning can’t happen between members of Congress it can absolutely happen between a candidate and the American people.Some ideas of shared visions for the country:On voting“What if we created national US identity cards for all Americans and legal residents. This card will attest to your US citizenship so that no one can cheat when they are voting. And it will allow the federal government to finally be able to monitor temporary residents. Congress has said they need to check in with the government at certain dates. Once the date of their card is up they will no longer be able to buy alcohol, open a bank account, get a drivers license.”On climate“I love my country. I consider myself to be very patriotic. And I also think that patriotism means to take good care of our land, our water, our sky. Patriotism means to preserve the incredible beauty of our country, to keep creating national parks that are affordable for all Americans today and in three, five, ten generations. In my faith tradition god gives us “dominion” over the rest of life. Whether or not you believe in God I invite us all to come together and look at how we can protect the beauty of our country, how we can continue to protect the greatness of America.”On immigration“I understand many Americans are concerned if we don’t do something on our southern border with Mexico there will be chaos. Some people are saying Democrats want completely open borders where people and goods can go back and forth at random. Nothing could be further from the truth. We are open to a merit-based system that allows us to welcome people from all different skill sets and walks of life. We are open to eliminating the so called “green card lottery”. But we really feel this can all be done calmly. We can be firm with undocumented folks without having to be cruel.Things get more complicated for people who have been here for a very long time. Because of the way our constitution is written their family members who are born here are automatically American citizens. It’s in no one’s best interest to separate parents from minors, or adult children from elderly parents. We can stop illegal immigration while allowing residents who don’t have a legal status but have settled here a way to study the language, to learn about our political and government systems and hopefully one day become bona fide US citizens.”OrOn healthcare“We can all agree the Founders included the right to bear arms because they wanted us to stay alive. I’d like to think they wrote about the pursuit of happiness because they wanted us to stay alive AND healthy. If they gave us the right to petition our government and the right to vote that means they also wanted us to be able to read and write.I promise I will give you a government that makes healthcare and education a right, not a commodity that only the very rich can purchase without going into massive debt. It’s a question of dignity. I know some of you fear socialism and even communism. But let’s remember we defeated Nazism in Germany and Ronald Reagan led the charge to help bring down Communism. I am quite confident — with the kind of American ingenuity we’re capable of — we can both make access to healthcare and education a right AND continue to be a solidly capitalist, entrepreneurial country.”OrOn the press“Many of you are concerned about truth in journalism. Indeed there is only one industry protected by our Constitution and that is the press — an industry that has been really shaken up since the advent of online news. Tons of good journalists have been laid off. Even the definition of the word press has changed. It’s important we create high standards of excellence in journalism so that we can all be informed without being manipulated or brainwashed. And if we can’t do it through the private sector we can at least create a real public media group that is guaranteed freedom from any political influence.Also I promise as President I will ask Congress to write a law making favoritism by the president toward one particular media outfit illegal. I think Freedom of the Press is in the first amendment along side religion and speech because it is something sacred, to be respected and looked out for. I believe the president should never ever show favoritism toward one media outfit or another because it has an unethical influence on the freedom of the press.”OrOn Transparency“The more government is hard to follow the easier it is for people to manipulate and corrupt it. We have a lot of work to do to make things easier for everyone to understand. One of the advantages of journalists was they could explain complex federal strategies to people in simple language. If they are a dying breed maybe the burden is on government to make itself far more transparent to all Americans?I told you I think the internet is the revolution that we must harness.According to the Consitution there is no “us” and “them”. We are all “us”. What if we streamlined services we offer to Americans to make them easier to understand and navigate?”Finally: A request and another promise:“I know this is a pivotal time for our country. We all sense we’re on the verge of big change. I promise you with all my heart I will make it my legacy before I die to implement policies so that OUR Republic comes out of this healthier and can thrive, not just survive, for another 250 years.I am proud to say after much reflection I am officially dropping my affiliation with my party. I am not wed to a party; I am wed to the Constitution and to the American people if I have the honor to be chosen to lead you for the next four years. Any one in government who agrees with these policies is welcome to drop their affiliations and join me no matter who you are. We will spend less time fighting and more time problem solving together.If you like everything I have announced I am asking you to do everything in your power to ask people around you to share this vision.If after four years I lose the popular vote — not the electoral college — I give you my word I will step down. I know that leaders are only elected for a limited time. If I can not make some of these simple structural changes happen I will happily go back to being a normal citizen again and let someone else try their hand at it.”Written byM.-A.

Reality Has Endorsed Degrowth,https://medium.com/@chris.jason.conrad/reality-has-endorsed-degrowth-c4366e533a8?source=tag_archive---------4-----------------------,"Degrowth,Ecological Economics,Climate Change,Political Science,Environment","Note: This is my crack at “Why Degrowth,” which I submitted as a student op-ed to my college’s political science department, hoping to introduce degrowth to an unfamiliar audience. As a result, this post primarily draws on others’ ideas, rather than my own (in particular, Jason Hickel’s new book, which is fantastic, and Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor for inspiring the title). I hope you’ll enjoy it anyway.Two weeks ago, I went on a hike in Big Basin Redwoods State Park with my parents. The park covers a huge amount of land in the Santa Cruz mountains, and is filled with redwoods (hence the name).One day later, the hottest temperature on Earth in the last hundred years was recorded in Death Valley.Two days later, Big Basin was on fire.All of it.Two years ago (has it really been that long?), I called my parents from college during the Camp Fire — which was happening pretty far north of where we lived. That didn’t matter though — the air quality in the Bay Area was hazardous enough that they hadn’t left the house for a week — N95 masks were sold out.Two years ago also marks the day that the IPCC told us something so hard to hear that hardly anyone has talked about it, even though it may be the single most important piece of information of the last decade.Other parts of the report still made headlines — it warned that going beyond global warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius threatened potentially catastrophic impacts to human society and told us that carbon emissions would have to fall by 50% by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050 in order to have a 50% chance of staying within 1.5 degrees.It is hard to overstate how challenging this will be. The IPCC itself wrote, “Limiting global warming to 1.5°C would require rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society.” Or, as Jason Hickel puts it, “It requires nothing less than a total and rapid reversal of our present direction as a civilization.”If we fail, we are facing the single worst thing that has likely ever happened in human history. Limiting warming to 2 degrees (the old target) instead of 1.5 will kill 150 million people. For context, this is more than the total deaths from World War II, the Korean War, the Gulf War, the Iraq War, the Rwandan Genocide, the Black Death, and COVID-19.Combined.Oh and by the way. Those 150 million deaths? They’re only from air pollution. Climate-related deaths from heat waves, droughts, (un)natural disasters, wildfires (like the one that is still ravaging Big Basin), famine, none of them are counted.Not to mention that climate change is deeply racial — the damage will fall mostly on postcolonial countries in the Global South (currently, 98% of the 400,000 deaths from climate change each year occur in the Global South).Also, our blind faith in technology’s ability to save us has currently put us on track for nearly 4 degrees Celsius of warming by century’s end, not 2. And 4 degrees (almost 8 degrees Fahrenheit) makes 2 look quaint. Scientists project 4 degrees will cut our global ability to grow food in half, and 75% of the world’s population will experience lethal heatwaves for multiple weeks, every year. Southern Europe will look like the Sahara desert.One of the world’s leading climate scientists estimates that Earth will only be able to support 4 billion people, and others warn that 4 degrees of warming will be incompatible with the existence of organized human society — an existential threat. Which I suppose makes sense — it’s hard to imagine any of our institutions surviving in a world where half the population has died.Of course, even if we listen to the IPCC, it might not be enough. Some activists have pointed out that the IPCC targets only give us a 50% chance of staying within 1.5 degrees. Coin flips are a fine way to gamble small sums, but when human civilization is at stake, a 50% chance of avoiding catastrophe is an unacceptable gamble.So, we really have to do everything we can to stay within 1.5 degrees. Practically any cost (even Bernie’s $16 trillion climate plan) is an order of magnitude lower than the raw, human toll of unstopped climate catastrophe.And this is where the IPCC report comes in (again).Remember how I mentioned that one part of the report didn’t get any attention?It’s this: the IPCC has functionally endorsed degrowth — a planned reduction in the material and energy throughput of the economy — as a way to solve climate change.The report outlines two sets of scenarios for staying within 1.5 degrees. One set of scenarios relies on mild emissions reductions paired with bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), which entails planting tree plantations, chopping down the trees and burning them to generate electricity, and capturing the CO2 upon burning to store it underground. Basically, BECCS would remove carbon from the air (through photosynthesis) and generate energy too, resulting in net negative emissions.Unfortunately, BECCS is a fantasy. The technology barely exists yet, and it seems unlikely it could be scaled up. Even if it could, the amount of BECCS required would be staggering — we’d have to convert a land area 2 to 3 times the size of India into tree plantations and build 17,000 energy facilities — whose land will be confiscated for the plantations? Moreover, because trees can’t grow anywhere, we’d have to convert two thirds of all arable land (which currently produces food) into tree plantations — likely meaning a famine as bad as the one a climate catastrophe would bring.Fortunately, the other set of IPCC scenarios doesn’t rely on humanity collectively jumping off a cliff and hoping someone will build a net (BECCS) to catch us before we hit the ground. In this set of scenarios, global use of energy and materials decreases while societies rapidly switch to zero carbon infrastructure. Because most energy use is tied up in the production of consumable products, this basically means ending over-consumption. This would occur primarily in the global north, where we consume far more energy and materials than is sustainable — the global south’s level of consumption is well below the line for sustainability, so degrowth isn’t necessary there.Which brings me to the undiscussed implication of the IPCC report: this would likely entail negative economic growth and falling GDP in the global north.Why? The reason is simple — the best empirical evidence we have shows that GDP is tightly linked to energy use. When the economy grows, energy use goes up. When it doesn’t grow (or shrinks), energy use falls. That’s why the only year in the last 20 that global CO2 emissions have fallen is 2009 (and soon, 2020).This linkage makes sense — GDP measures all the monetized final goods and services in the economy, and pretty much everything that’s sold relies on an energy foundation — manufacturing a car requires energy to power the factory, restaurants need power to operate, selling software requires energy to power computers, etc.But wait. Why does energy use have to fall? Can’t we just switch to renewables and then keep growing energy use?Unfortunately, no. Because economic growth compounds, a 3% growth rate doubles the size of the economy every 24 years. In other words, if we continue to pursue growth, the global economy will be twice as large by 2050, and energy use will likely have doubled with it.The last few decades of economic growth have driven global energy use up astronomically, so even though renewable energy has grown, fossil fuel has grown by more, instead of declining. With economic growth we get energy addition instead of an energy transition.That’s why energy use has to fall. Even with optimistic assumptions, supply constraints on key metals (lithium, neodymium, etc) mean that we can only bring renewables online to replace about 4–7% of existing energy use per year. The math works out such that a fall in energy use is basically the only thing compatible with achieving the IPCC’s emissions reductions targets — if we keep growing, we won’t be able to replace fossil fuels fast enough.In other words, reality has endorsed degrowth. The world’s best scientists at the IPCC have warned us that if we want a shot at avoiding climate catastrophe, we need to fundamentally reorient the economy towards less material/energy use (or jump of the BECCS cliff and gamble with billions of lives).Which brings me to the elephant in the room.Isn’t this basically advocating for a permanent recession (even if it saves billions of lives)?No. I’d argue that recessions are unplanned economic shocks that reduce people’s wellbeing — people lose their jobs (and in the US, healthcare), face eviction, loss of income, and more. Degrowth is a planned reduction in the material/energy throughput of the economy that seeks to maximize wellbeing, even as we deliberately produce and consume less.Put simply, degrowth posits that we can increase human wellbeing while reducing economic activity. We already know this is possible — Europe has about half the GDP per capita of the US, but scores much better than the US on practically every social metric — self reported happiness, education, life expectancy, the list goes on. Costa Rica has a fifth the GDP of the US and better life expectancy. The US in 1970 was statistically happier than it is today, despite the economy being more than twice as large now.So how do we do this? How can we decouple wellbeing from GDP?Degrowth’s academic arm has a lot of answers to this question. Legislate an end to planned obsolescence — if products last 4 times as long, consumption will fall 75%. Restrict advertising, so people aren’t pushed to buy stuff they don’t need. Tax luxury consumption (which has an outsized ecological impact) more heavily. Set decreasing caps on material and energy use to ensure we hit IPCC targets. End fossil fuel subsidies, place moratoriums on new fossil fuel projects, and fund massive public investments in renewables.This would deal with material and energy use (and therefore, climate change), but how do we improve wellbeing while pursuing degrowth?Provide a federal job guarantee so anyone can find a job that pays them a living wage (this would also permanently end unemployment and pressure the private sector to pay workers fairly). Introduce work-sharing and a shorter working week so that a reduction in the total number of jobs doesn’t leave anyone unemployed (which would also boost wellbeing — after all, who wouldn’t like a permanent 3 day weekend).Introduce steeply progressive taxes on the wealthy to create a more fair and equal distribution (which a lot of empirical research has found boosts wellbeing). Plus, the revenue could be used to fund universal public services — healthcare, education, housing, etc — which empirical research has found to be the single best way to boost wellbeing. One study found that it only costs $10,000 per person to get the highest levels of life expectancy, education, nutrition, employment, and life satisfaction — the US private healthcare system sucks up $9,500 per person each year.In other words, it costs less than the average global GDP per capita ($11,300) to give everyone access to the ingredients for a decent life — hardly the “voluntary impoverishment” that degrowth’s opponents misconstrue it as. Indeed, with degrowth, society would be more equal, and we’d have the freedom to spend our time doing what really matters to us (time with friends and family, hobbies, etc) instead of being slaves to a 40 hour work week. With universal public services, we’d be provided for — we’d work less, and enjoy life more.These proposals may seem radical. I’d suggest the opposite — what’s radical is the idea that continuing GDP growth is more important than saving 150 million-4 billion people from climate catastrophe.People tell me degrowth is politically impossible. Unfortunately for them, scientific reality does not care about political feasibility. Reality has endorsed degrowth. Now it’s up to us to make it political reality.One final note. Big Basin may have caught fire, but the redwoods are still standing. In some way, this reminds me that although we may throw ourselves (and countless other species) into the void within the century, nature will likely endure without us. The planet will survive — we may not.Written byChristopher ConradFollow32 32 32 DegrowthEcological EconomicsClimate ChangePolitical ScienceEnvironmentMore from Christopher ConradFollowMore From MediumCry, They Are CalledMatthew BattlesMore Americans Are Getting Their Electricity Cut OffBloomberg in BloombergClimate solutions: Working with natureMatt Rees in European Investment Bank CONNECTCalifornia’s agricultural system needs to adapt to drought and a changing climateOlivia Holmes in Environment AmericaWhat does mass incarceration have to do with environmental degradation?

"<strong class=""bt"">What the Data Says About Getting People to Vote From Home</strong>",https://medium.com/@hill_charlotte/what-the-data-says-about-getting-people-to-vote-by-mail-62bd0dcb0ff4?source=tag_archive---------5-----------------------,"Vote By Mail,Voting,2020,Elections,Political Science","The research behind Vote From Home 2020’s plan to get swing states voting from home this NovemberAt Vote From Home 2020, we’re completely focused on one thing: taking registered voters who face high risks from voting in person, and getting them to vote from home instead. There are 2.5 million of these voters in battleground states. If we don’t convert them to mail voters, they may not turn out in November — and that would tilt the election to Donald Trump.In past posts, Vote From Home 2020 co-founder Ben Tyson explained why this work is essential and how our unique “life-cycle organizing model” works. Today, I’m walking through the data behind our work: which voter conversion and mobilization tactics work best, and how effective they are. I’m a Ph.D. candidate at UC Berkeley with a master’s degree in public policy analysis, and my research focuses on vote-by-mail laws and voter turnout.By the end of this post, you’ll understand the numbers behind Vote From Home 2020’s strategy of converting in-person voters to mail voters — and why this work is critical to defeating Trump in November.The problem: 2.5 million critical voters might not turn outOne of the many scary realities of 2020 is that, despite unprecedented enthusiasm among progressives, we can’t count on high turnout in November. That’s because millions of voters at risk of contracting COVID-19 may avoid the polls, without the support they need to vote at home instead.Black and Latinx voters face much higher risks to voting in person.To start, recent federal data finds Black and Latinx voters are 3 times more likely to contract Covid-19 than whites. These same voters also face longer voting lines: a Brennan Center report released this summer found that “Latino voters waited on average 46 percent longer than white voters, and Black voters waited on average 45 percent longer than white voters.” And the GOP is now reportedly deploying 50,000 people to “monitor polling places and challenge ballots and voters deemed suspicious” — in other words, to intimidate voters.Black, Latinx, AAPI, and young voters are historically far less likely to successfully vote from home.Research finds that low-income, young, and liberal voters are less likely to vote absentee than older, white, more conservative voters. Part of the problem is a sheer lack of resources: more than half of young people (who are disproportionately people of color) lack access to stamps and printers. Another important issue is lack of information: most young voters, and especially youth of color, have never voted by mail before and aren’t sure how the process works. My own research finds that young people are far less likely to know their state’s mail-voting laws.We need to help voters navigate the process, so their votes are counted.Vote From Home 2020 is providing comprehensive vote-by-mail support to young, Black, Latinx, and AAPI swing-state voters. We’re doing everything we can to increase people’s chances of voting successfully from home:We’re sending paper vote-by-mail applications.We’re including prepaid postage and well-designed return envelopes.We’re following up with multiple calls and texts to walk them through the process of applying.We’re helping voters develop a voting plan so they understand their options for casting a ballot — and we’re doing it early.We’re staying in touch with voters until we have official confirmation that their ballot has been returned and received.Let’s break down the data behind each of these choices.We’re sending paper vote-by-mail applications.All of our targeted voters are receiving a form that they can fill out to request an absentee ballot. Why paper applications? Because they are incredibly effective at driving take-up of mail voting: a 2017 study found that mailing voters a paper application can nearly double their likelihood of voting from home . A separate 2016 study by the Analyst Institute, a research institution for liberal organizations, found that mailing applications increases turnout by 1.5–2.3 percentage points. In general, sending direct mail to voters is incredibly cost-effective, generating about 10 votes for every $1K spent (VPK), according to the Analyst Institute. (Yes, this sounds like a lot of money, but it’s actually quite affordable in the world of voter mobilization.We’re including prepaid postage and well-designed return envelopes.Voters are more likely to return election forms when they don’t have to pay for postage. Case in point: when King County, Washington, rolled out prepaid postage in 2018, it saw its highest-ever levels of vote-by-mail turnout — above and beyond projected turnout based on historical data.We’re also taking cues from the Center for Civic Design, using their envelope design as a starting point for our direct mail. This research institution extensively tests the language and visuals on election materials to determine which are most effective at driving high return rates.We’re following up with multiple calls and texts.We’re committed to contacting voters repeatedly throughout the 2020 election cycle — because it works. Research suggests that repeatedly contacting voters about voting from home, specifically, increases their likelihood of turning out. A 2011 study found that, all else being equal, each additional communication about voting from home improved registered voters’ odds of voting by nearly 4%.And we’re not limiting ourselves to physical mail. Our incredible team of volunteers is making calls and sending texts to ensure swing-state voters return their mail-in ballot applications — and, eventually, their ballots — on time. We use data from local election offices to know who hasn’t returned their application yet — and our volunteers follow up until they do. Research shows that calling and texting voters increases turnout by up to 3 percentage points and generates approximately 8.5 VPK (text) and 6.6 VPK (phone).We’re helping voters develop a voting plan — and we’re doing it early.Our text and phone outreach is largely geared toward helping people make a plan for voting. If they’re already planning to vote from home, great. We get them the information they need to do it. If they’re planning to vote in person, we make sure they’ve taken the steps to have mail voting as a back-up option.This is critically important. We know from past research that helping individuals form their own voting plan can increase turnout by more than 4 percentage points. Moreover, recent research from the Human Rights Campaign finds that just 48% of voters of color are currently planning to vote from home — but if there’s no Covid cure or vaccine by Election Day, a full 75% of voters of color want to vote from home . Let’s be clear: we are very unlikely to have a cure for Covid by the election. This means that 27% of voters of color who will want to vote from home come election time are not currently taking the preparatory steps to do so, such as formally requesting a mail-in ballot. Vote From Home 2020’s work is focused on closing that gap.We’re staying in touch with voters until we have official confirmation that their ballot has been returned and received.For many voters, casting a ballot isn’t the last step to voting. One recent study found that in Florida’s 2018 election, 5.4% of voters ages 18–21 had their ballot rejected, compared to just 0.6% of voters over 65. Black, Hispanic, and other minority voters were more than twice as likely as white voters to have their mail ballots rejected. These voters have a chance to fix the problem and have their vote counted — but many never realize there was a problem in the first place. Our extensive voter outreach program tackles this challenge head-on.Throughout the voting period, we’ll regularly update our database with information on whose votes have been counted — and whose remain unprocessed. Our volunteers will do everything they can to reach voters whose ballots haven’t gone through, make sure they know there’s a problem, and give them the information they need to take any necessary follow-up actions, such as filling out a signed affidavit and returning to their elections office. If that sounds cumbersome and time-consuming, that’s because it is — which is all the more reason for us to help voters every step of the way.There you have it — our data-driven approach to helping high-risk swing-state voters cast their ballots by mail in 2020.Have any questions? Share them in the comments below, and I’ll do my best to answer them.Oh, and while I have your attention — please consider making a grassroots donation to Vote From Home 2020.

For me, being a political scientist has also meant experiencing politics up close. As we approach the presidential conventions, this is my story about how I landed at the 1984 Democratic National Convention in San Francisco, where, before the pandemic, I hoped to attend the APSA meeting this year. Get ready for a party hosted by Willie Brown where Jefferson Starship dueled with the San Francisco Gay Men’s Chorus for our attention.Photo by Joseph Barrientos on UnsplashPart 1Wanting to be a delegate to the Democratic National ConventionI was raised by very political grandparents in Brooklyn. We all read the daily papers — the Post, News, and Times as well as the Brooklyn Eagle and Mirror — from front to end, listened to news and special events on the radio, and as soon as we were able to afford a television, watched the nightly news. I remember watching the 1952 Republican Convention, featuring competing demonstrations by Eisenhower and Taft delegates.My grandparents really hated Taft for the Taft-Hartley Law and they disliked Ike as soon as they learned that he was a Republican. In the Democratic convention, they liked Stevenson because he was smart. The highlight of 1956 was the multi-ballot contest for Vice-President between the gallant young JFK, the unexpected NYC mayor, Bob Wagner, and Estes Kefauver. We sat on edge watching it, fascinated by the interviews of the delegates and watching the competing demonstrations up and down the aisles of the convention halls with strange names in far-away cities.Then came 1960.We hated Nixon and loved Stevenson until Eleanor Roosevelt gave a televised speech saying that a Catholic couldn’t win. We were Jews and loved FDR and Eleanor but we thought that it was wrong to say that someone couldn’t win because of his religion. And there were all of these televised interviews of the delegates. Delegates also were interviewed during the debate over the civil rights plank in the platform. Oh, these delegates were important people!Then came 1964 and the Freedom Delegates’ fight to be seated instead of the segregationists “elected” by states that prevented Blacks from registering and voting. My grandparents died in early 1963 and I went to the University of North Carolina to study Black political participation. My whole life surrounded the Civil Rights Movement. My dissertation advisors were national experts on Black voting rights and we were all glued to the television, watching the convention delegates vote to seat the Black insurgents. These delegates were making important decisions about the greatest issue facing the US.Oh, how I wished I could have been there!Then came 1968. By then, I was home in New York City and taching at Hunter College in Manhattan. I was 25 and a Ph. D. in political science, teaching courses in parties and elections and in public opinion and political participation. I wandered into Bobby Kennedy’s headquarters and the great Ronnie Eldridge asked me to be the office manager for the Kennedy campaign in the 20th CD. We had three candidates for delegate: Bill Ryan, our Congressman, Freddy Ohrenstein, our State Senator, and Margie Cox, a Democratic State Committee member from Central Harlem.There I was, running the day-to-day campaign operations for three delegates to a convention that we hoped would dump Johnson, end the War in Vietnam, bring about racial justice, and end the problems of the cities. We know how that ended for us but I’d gotten to know many people in the McCarthy campaign and saw those delegates get bloodied and beaten, heroically standing up for all that was great in America. My sister and many of my friends were bloodied in the streets at that convention too, but I *really*wanted to be inside. I wanted to be one of those people who fought for justice. I wanted to be a delegate.I was still under 30 at the time of the 1972 DNC but that wasn’t enough for the McGovern campaign and even I couldn’t stay up late enough to watch much of it. After the convention, Bobby Wagner told me that Carol Greitzer, a notoriously lazy member of the NY City Council, missed some key votes because she left the convention floor to get some sleep. I helped to run a failed campaign against her by Jim Owles in 1973, the first openly gay candidate in NYC. Jim got 14% of the vote.My strongest memory of Birch Bayh’s campaign in 1976 is that he became the first presidential candidate to campaign in a New York City gay bar. It was on a weekend afternoon and we were able to fill the Upper East Side neighborhood bar with what passed for the LGBT establishment. Bayh got up to speak in front of a potted palm tree and constantly had to brush palm branches from his face. He was courageous but visibly nervous as he spoke to the small crowd, constantly referring to us as “you people”, something that did not go over well. Finally, Arthur Bell of the Village Voice shouted out, “Say the word! GAY!!! Say the word!!!”Things went downhill from that as the executive director of the Lesbian and Gay Task Force, standing next to Bayh, said, “Oh, Senator, we’re not all like that.”In 1977, I won a primary for now-US Congressman Jerry Nadler’s old seat as Democratic District Leader in the 69th AD, becoming New York’s first openly gay elected official. In early 1980, all of the Manhattan District Leaders were invited to Jimmy Carter’s White House for a briefing in the hope of preventing our supporting Teddy Kennedy’s candidacy. We paid for our own AMTRAK round trip and for our own lunch, got a perfunctory summary of all the good things President Carter had done, were told that the President had hoped to see us but was in a more important meeting and we were invited to walk through the Oval Office before leaving the White House.Photo by Library of Congress on UnsplashMost of us supported Kennedy and my only connection to the convention was to help escort a group of delegates on a bus tour of The Bronx. Designed to show how the President had helped to restore The Bronx, two sparkling clean NYC buses drove to Banana Kelly, a model of urban renewal, to the Bronx Botanical Garden and then past a block of burning houses, to Yankee Stadium, where the then hapless Yankees lost the game. Two delegates from the state of Washington sat behind me at the stadium and offered me a bag of dust from Mount St. Helena’s recent eruption.You can’t make this stuff up.Finally, in 1984, a group of local leaders persuaded the Mondale campaign that the New York delegation should include some gay people and I was invited to run in Charlie Rangel’s district, with Charlie’s support. The only problem was that we were running against a Jesse Jackson slate in the congressional district in which Jackson got more votes than any candidate in any other congressional district. Fortunately, the well-intentioned party rules worked out in my favor. Mondale got enough votes for a single delegate and alternate delegate in the district. The first alternate seat went to the highest vote getter, who turned out to be a woman. This meant that Mondale got the male delegate. Even though Herman D. Farrell, III, got more votes than I did, I won the primary.Next up was a trip to San Francisco which I’ll get to in Part 2.3StreamsA blog about politics, policy, and ideasFollowKen Sherrill1984 DemconventionConventiondelegatePolitical ScienceLGBTQWritten byKenneth SherrillFollowProfessor Emeritus of political science at Hunter College, CUNY and Graduate School, CUNY.

What the 2020 Democratic Party Platform Tells Us About Joe Biden’s Issue Priorities,https://medium.com/3streams/what-the-2020-democratic-party-platform-tells-us-about-joe-bidens-issue-priorities-fa8f15dd8f24?source=tag_archive---------7-----------------------,"2020 Presidential Race,Democratic Convention,Democratic Party,Political Science,Joe Biden","Photo: Anthony Quintano / flickrThe Democratic National Committee released their platform for the 2020 election this week. It contains 62 dense pages of policy promises, ranging from statehood for Washington, DC to expanding U.S. Department of Agriculture loans to small farmers to a $15 minimum wage.It’s tempting to treat the platform as an academic exercise. Few voters will ever read it, and it in no ways binds the party to policy decisions should they regain power. However, my research shows that the issues emphasized in the platform tend to predict the issues that the new Congress will take up after the election. Party coalitions use the platform as an opportunity to hash out the party’s issue priorities. Thus, we can learn about what what a Biden Administration 2021 policy agenda might look like.We can roughly approximate the attention to issues in the Democratic platform with a quick content analysis of the platform’s table of contents. Below, I’ve counted the percentage of pages devoted to each Policy Agendas Project policy topic.While party platforms tend to have a heavy emphasis on foreign affairs due to the President’s dominant role in foreign policy, Joe Biden’s emphasis on diplomacy is clear. The platform devotes about 17% of its pages to foreign affairs, up from about 11% in 2016. Unlike some of the defense-heavy platforms of the 2000s, the 2020 Democratic platform focuses on peacetime foreign policy goals like rebuilding damaged alliances.The platform also has a strong emphasis on health care. While Democrats traditionally prioritize the issue, the 2016 and 2020 Democratic platforms more than 10% of their text to health care. Democrats include extended promises on a public option for health insurance. It pledges to automatically enroll low-income families that would be eligible for the Medicaid Expansion in states that did not join the program. The platform also makes extended promises to address the cost of prescription drugs, inequities in the health care system, and to dramatically increase funding for research and development.We also see considerable attention to civil rights, climate change, immigration and education. These, along with traditional health care and redistributive economic policy, are core Democratic policy priorities. However, the platform emphasis in line with previous platforms.In contrast, the platform has relatively little emphasis on many other economic policy issues. It only spends a handful of pages each on labor, anti-trust, trade, housing, banking regulation, taxes and social welfare policy. Much of this section is devoted to dealing with the economic damaged caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, with surprisingly little on other issues. During the primary, Democratic candidates like Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and Kamala Harris introduced many interesting and innovative policy ideas in these areas, but they are for the most part absent from the platform.The biggest change from previous platforms is an emphasis on democratic reforms. It promises to allow Washington DC and Puerto Rico to become states, make Election Day a national holiday, strengthen the Voting Rights Act, and fight voter suppression and gerrymandering. It also promises to enact government transparency reforms in response to corruption in the Trump Administration. While modern Democratic platforms have always included pro-voting and good governance planks, they expanded these sections considerably in 2020.Overall, this platform signals three clear goals for the Democrats in 2021. If elected, Joe Biden will have a heavy emphasis on diplomacy and non-military foreign affairs. A Democratic Congress will likely first focus on passing a major health care reform that includes a robust public option and prescription drug price regulation before moving on to education, civil rights, immigration and climate change. It will spend less time on changes to business regulation and redistributive economic policy.Finally, Democrats will likely prioritize major changes to voting rights and anti-corruption with an intensity not seen since Watergate.3StreamsA blog about politics, policy, and ideasFollow5 2 2020 Presidential RaceDemocratic ConventionDemocratic PartyPolitical ScienceJoe Biden5 claps5 claps2 responsesWritten byE.J.

Freedom: A Concoction of Cure and Poison,https://medium.com/@miercdelacruz/freedom-a-concoction-of-cure-and-poison-ad51d2f26548?source=tag_archive---------8-----------------------,"Democracy,Political Science,Politics,Political Theory,Prose","CureIn a democracy, the people are bestowed with various sets of rights. These rights include right to free speech, right to life, right to privacy and many more rights that uphold the constituents’ well-being depending on a state’s constitution. Particularly, the pinnacle of democracy is where the constituents are given the power to elect their own set of public officials through a fair and just elections (Heywood, 2014). In fact, scholars say that an election is the backbone of democracy, and this is backed up by the inalienable right of the citizens to suffrage.Taking into account the correlativity of rights and duties, the rights of one are the duties of another. The citizens’ right to vote comes with their duty of political participation, specifically in elections, because their entitlement to vote is a responsibility to the state. In the electoral process of a democracy, the constituents are provided with the power to choose their own set of leaders, and they can do so by voting in the elections. However, participation in the elections does not simply stop with casting a vote and moving on with one’s life. Political participation in elections also come with the responsibility of choosing the leaders one will vote for. The role of the citizens then includes not only to vote in elections, but also to discern and scrutinize the aspiring public servants that will be elected to govern the state. In order to fulfill this role, one must acknowledge two things: the essence of a state and the quality of leaders we ought to have.Plato is one of the prominent political philosophers who discussed the foundations for order in a polity. Particularly, he pointed out the essence of the state and what the ideal rulers should be. Knowing the essence of the creation of the state and the qualities of the leaders we ought to have is crucial in a democratic society, because we will be putting the country’s future in the hands of the elected leaders.According to Plato in his book titled “The Republic”, the state is created because “no individual is self-sufficing; we all have many needs. We call in one another’s help to satisfy our various requirements.” The state here is deemed as a collection of people that builds a society geared towards solidarity bound with codependency. Because no two people are exactly alike, the roles they play are vital because one cannot simply replace the other — one is born naturally fit in his unique role (Curtis, 2008). This perspective of Plato shows how we need each other to survive, and unbeknownst to us we depend on each other for our survival. This is subtly evident in our everyday life: how people need Jeepney drivers to commute, how we need farmers to feed the country, and how we need the street sweepers to keep the streets clean. A retaliation might be this: one can actually do job of the other. However, as Plato had advised, “more things will be produced and the work be more easily and better done, when every man is set free from all other occupations to do, at the right time, the one thing for which he is naturally fitted.” Although one may try farming, he cannot do other things all at once; hence, the need for others to do the jobs they are naturally fitted arises. Inculcating the vital role of one vis-à-vis to another will nurture a society that aims for the growth and development of the state as a whole. In this perspective, the growth of one is the growth of the other; the downfall of one is the downfall of the other. However, one may rebut with, “but we have elected public officials now that grows on their own while the others suffer from various reasons.” That fact is evident to all of us, and that is the problem of our society today. We continue to elect public officials that do not serve the best interest of our nation as a whole. What is worse is that we allow them to proliferate when in fact we, the people in a democratic society, hold the power to dethrone them from their ivory tower and actually elect candidates that strive to suffice the needs not just of one class, but of the country as a whole. Embodying this perspective of the state shows how the political community is related to the character of the citizen body; an empowered citizenry is an empowered society. And this perspective of the state is important to understand as one participates in an election, because it shows the most important thing to think of when we vote, and that is this: we ought to vote not to pursue the interest of one sector. We ought to vote to pursue the well-being of our nation as a whole, and our failure to do so will be the doom of the state.With the perspective that we must vote to pursue the well-being of our nation, one now faces the dilemma of how to wield the power of voting to uphold the best interest of our state. Now comes the question: who should I vote for? Plato argued that a good man reflects a good state — possessing wisdom, courage, temperance and justice. Respectively, a good man aims for the best possible conduct of the state, possesses the power of persevering conviction, controls certain pleasures, and respects the vital role of all constituents in a state. To put it more clearly, Plato directly quoted, “philosophers must be kings”, primarily because philosophy aims to manifest the right way of thinking about things. The philosophers, with their passion for wisdom, “will be one who desires all wisdom, not only some part of it” (Curtis, 2008). These philosophers’ goal is to see the truth whose affections are set on the reality; they descend to the dark realm of ordinary life to seek for the truth of the many. Plato enumerated the qualities of a philosopher: 1) an individual who has a constant passion for any knowledge that will reveal to them the reality that people endures; 2) a person who bears a love of truth and a hatred of falsehood that will not tolerate untruth in any form; 3) a being that embodies temperance and no lover of money, for he will be the last person to care about the things for the sake of which money is eagerly sought and lavishly spent; 4) a man who does not have a mean and cowardly nature; and 5) an individual with a good memory — quick to learn. Directly quoting Curtis (2008), a philosopher “will be quick to learn and to remember, magnanimous and gracious, the friend and kinsman of truth, justice, courage, and temperance.” These qualities of a person are what constitutes who we should vote for. We must position the bar high, because the lives of the people will be in the hands of the elected. We shall do this by first reminding ourselves of the qualities a leader should have, and shape our society to think the same. As Edmund Burke has stated, the individual is always molded by environment and history. And we shall mold our society by molding ourselves first — by starting to be aware of our responsibility to choose our public servants wisely.PoisonKnowing the essence of a state and the qualities of public officials we ought to have is only a part of the bigger picture called liberal democracy, a political ideology that operates under the principles of liberalism. To make it clear, democracy is the type of government, while liberalism is the theory on maintaining the social order; they go hand-in-hand as the latter may be considered as the agency while the former is the structure. In line with democracy, liberalism constitutes the freedom of individuality as its core idea and rejects arbitrary authority (Carnoy, 2014). It embodies freedom of thought and expression, reduction or elimination of coercion, toleration of contesting perspectives, limitation on the exercise of power through constitutional arrangements or guaranties of individual rights, right of people to choose their political and religious views, and existence of a free opposition to established authority. Liberalism can be divided into two: early liberalism and modern liberalism (Cunningham, 2002). The former believes in the laissez faire (“let it be”) and is concentrated on the “negative liberty” of individuals embodying the freedom of interference by other people. The latter on the other hand accepts the need for state intervention [in the economy]. Basically then, as an ideology, the essence of liberal democracy is to protect individual rights and individual property by rule of law such as through the introduction of bill of rights (Browning, 2000).This, along with Plato’s idea of the essence of a state, can be further supported by John Locke’s social contract called Second Treatise of Government (1689). Locke stood with his central notion that individuals in a state of nature willingly come together to form a state, and that they would be bound morally by the law of nature to not harm each other in their lives or possession (Gaba, 2007). The government is formed to defend the constituents against harm, and it is deemed to act as a “neutral judge” that aims to protect the lives, liberty, and property of those who belong in it. In relation to liberal democracy, the legitimacy of the government in Locke’s social contract comes from the citizens’ consent which has to be constantly present. And this legitimacy is obtained, in contemporary period, through a fair and just elections.However, there is a downfall in having too much freedom, without acknowledging responsibilities, in a liberal democracy. John Stuart Mill was one of the political philosophers that stood by liberalism by positing that freedom is the absence of restraints and the individual is sovereign over his own mind and body. More so, since liberal democracy imposes the inherent liberty of individuals, participation should be both expected and unexpected as we ought to respect the freedom of individuals to act on their preferences rather than being obliged by an institution, while observing the presence of democracy (Chrisman, 2012). This is flawed in a liberal democracy setting because it fails to define the limits between freedom and government action, and it overlooks the role of society in creating the consciousness of man. As Edmund Burke has claimed, the concept of a sovereign individual is problematic and meaningless because the individual is always molded by environment and history. We all are bound to a structure that motivates our agencies; and our agencies in fact may bend the structure. This is most evident in a liberal democratic state that practice elections.The Philippines, for instance, is a liberal democratic state that observes elections and bestows rights to its constituents. Filipinos are provided with the right to vote, as per Article 5, Section 1 of the 1987 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines. Likewise, Filipinos are provided with functioning facilities to cast votes through the Commission on Elections. Given the fact that Filipinos have the right to vote, following Mill’s ideology, they are not required to do so in a liberal democracy because as aforementioned political participation is both expected and unexpected as we ought to respect the freedom of individuals to act on their preferences rather than being obliged by an institution. Furthermore, if Filipinos are not aware of the essence of a state and the qualities of leaders we ought to have, liberal democracy will fail because it will be deemed ineffective and be abused by self-interested candidates that do not aim the best interest of the nation as a whole. Technically speaking, the Philippines observe the First Past The Post (FPTP) electoral system, where mass participation can be deemed as a mere representation as it only needs a plurality rule. This means that a candidate can win an election even if not majority (50% + 1) of the population participated in the elections. Therefore, in a liberal democracy, citizens’ direct participation is assumed, but it can come out as a mere representation not only by its electoral process, but also by the lack of political participation of the citizens. More so, since liberal democracy imposes the inherent liberty of individuals, participation should be both expected and unexpected as we ought to respect the freedom of individuals to act on their preferences rather than being obliged by an institution, while observing the presence of democracy. This means that an individual can choose both to vote and not to vote; they are expected to do so, but are not required to do so. And this is where Burke is correct: we have manifested an environment (structure) of weak political participation (agency) that creates a society blind of its political responsibility. Thus, liberal democracy may breed citizens that are unbeknownst of their political rights and duties, which lead to a society manifested by self-serving rulers.Conclusion“There never will be a perfect state or constitution”, said by one of the greatest philosophers of all time, Plato. Indeed, democracy bestows us many rights that we all lavish in our own ways. Liberal democracy respects the individuality of all constituents, and, above all, it upholds the liberty of men to actualize their own interests. It is no question that this makes us feel free like a bird, flapping its wings towards unimaginable sights. However, we are not birds. We are rational human beings capable of making sound decisions. And we ought to use our rationality to actualize the vision we have not only for ourselves, but also for our society as a whole.Thus, in order to actualize our vision, we must manifest it in our agency then try to shape the structure of our society in the way we envision it to be. In a liberal democracy, we are provided with multitude rights that uphold our well-being. However, we must remember that our rights come with duties, and it is most needed when we elect public servants to govern us. By knowing the essence of a state, by knowing the ideal qualities a leader should have, and by acknowledging our responsibility of political participation through elections, we can bend the political structure in the way we envision it to be. By knowing the poison that comes with freedom, we will become aware of the antidote we need to engulf: the appalling truth that opens our eyes to the reality of our state. And if we want to change it, we must take action now.References:Browning, G. (2000). Contemporary liberalism. Understanding contemporary society: Theories of the present, 152–164.Carnoy, M. (2014).

Why China lacks Soft Power? For Now..,https://medium.com/@tamsen.ikard/why-china-lacks-soft-power-for-now-a10d1180b2a3?source=tag_archive---------9-----------------------,"Geopolitics,Politics,China,China Vs Usa,Political Science","A common criticism of China in the western media is that China does not have soft power. Then those media articles typically start bashing China by saying they don’t have soft power because it lacks democracy. Then they point out how the West is popular, respected and well-liked across the world because it has freedom and democracy and so forth.Another argument typically is that China is not being nice to other countries. It is bullying them or stealing from them. So, it lacks popularity and soft power.But do these arguments have any factual validity? Is there really a fundamental problem with China that is preventing them from having soft power?The bigger question is: why do certain countries have soft power? What causes soft power to rise?Let’s first define what I mean by soft power because it might have many definitions. Soft power for me is people following your culture, learning your language, following your entertainment products such as books and movies and finally following your political system and social norms.What causes countries to become powerful and popular?My argument is that soft power is nothing but hard power that is being applied for a long time. Here I define hard power as money, technology and military power. So, if your country is rich, big and technologically advanced, then it will have hard power. If your country remains powerful for a long time, it will naturally develop soft power. There is no magic behind soft power that only the West has and China lacks.Another aspect that I want to discuss, is whether a country’s nice or rude behavior has any effect on how much soft power a country has. This is obviously much easier to refute. Since when were the Europeans and Americans ever really nice to the rest of the world. The history of Europeans is full of stories of colonization, exploitation, genocide and war. But that has no effect on its soft power. American history for the last 2 centuries has been full of invasions on bullying behavior towards its latin american neighbours. But those countries still look up to US as the country to emulate and consume its entertainment and cultural products.Countries don’t get powerful because of outside nations support them getting powerful. Countries get powerful because of structural strengths that causes that power to rise. These structural factors could be big population, natural resources, a society that is fully united an don’t have too many divisions due to ethnic or religious factors. When these factors exist then a country can develop its economy and spend money on research into newer technology.How does hard power causes soft power to grow?When people of a country becomes rich, they have more money to spend on things like entertainment, which creates a bigger market for entertainers to develop themselves. Moreover, if a country is rich, it will have people that are more educated and people that have the money and time to follow their hobbies. Many talented people would never discover their talent in a poor country, because they don’t have the time to follow their hobbies. They are either busy working or studying.Being a rich country also means the bigger entertainment market is seen a viable career path for many people. They will not feel pressure from society and relatives if they become a writer or singer. This means more talented people, who probably would not join the entertainment business start to do so because now they have a viable market. This creates higher quality cultural and entertainment products.Again, rich but tiny country will not have impact in the global entertainment business. So, the country has to be both rich and have large enough population.How does hard power effect how other countries behave towards that rich country?When countries become rich and powerful they have more money to spend outside their own country for entertainment, investment and leisure. People of those outside countries start to notice this and naturally move in directions to get more money. So, they might learn their language, or focus on learning their culture.A country that is rich powerful will also naturally have powerful companies and brands that are willing to expand to other countries. This will create good and high paying jobs in those poorer countries. This again creates incentives for the elites of those countries to educate themselves with culture and language of that powerful country. Slowly, over time, the language of that powerful country will be more well-known. That will again create an audiance in those poorer countries who now know the language and can consume entertainment products such as movies and books.How does hard power create friends and allies? How does hard power make political systems popular?When a country get rich and powerful, people naturally and automatically start to be friendly with them, just so that they can use that power for their own benefits. Ideas and political groups that were suppressed by countries that are the current hegemon start to appeal to this newly powerful country for support so that they no longer have to be suppressed.A country that is rich and powerful will naturally have supporters who will look at the political system and governance of that country and think the reason that country got rich is because their governance system is good. “Maybe our country should have the same system and we will prosper”, is what they think.The powerful country will also support countries with political systems that are similar to theirs and more friendly towards them. So, their financial and military power will let those countries grow and that political system will have more support.This is how a country gets powerful and popular. This is how a country gets soft power. Soft power and popularity is nothing but hard power that is available and being applied for a long time.World map by GDP per Capita (Nominal)Why does the West have so much soft power?Let’s look at the west and why it has so much soft power. This will become clear when we look at the world map colored by GDP per capita. The western countries of Europe and European settled countries like America and Australia are much more richer than the rest of the world. In fact, just 1 billion westerners hold 60% of world GDP compared to the rest of the world which has a population of 6 billion. The only other countries who are rich are east asian countries that direct vassals of the west such as Japan and South Korea. These countries do not have real independence and are completely dominated by the west in terms of military and foreign policy.So, we have a culture and countries of that culture that are utterly dominant in hard power.Western thought, Western entertainment industry and Western political system is popular and dominant because they have been the countries with the most hard power for almost 3 centuries now. They were the richest countries for a long time and had the viable market to develop a solid entertainment industry with high quality product. Everyone else were colonized or mostly rural and poor and didn’t have the luxury to develop an entertainment industry.Western language is popular because again they have been the richest and most powerful countries for 3 centuries. People of other countries learn English not because its somehow the magic language, its because for the last 200 years most of the business came from British and Americans who spoke English. Most of the military power and technology came from these countries. If you wanted to get rich and survive you had to learn English.Western political system, that is democracy is popular again because people think if they use democracy, it will make their country better. They want to become like the west and try to emulate them.What does this mean for China’s chances of developing soft power?A strong and rich China will naturally have soft power in all these aspects just by that hard power alone. Its all about having that money and power and having that power for a long time. A rich China that is able to remain rich for 200 years will utterly dominate soft power in many parts of the world. A rich China that is able to remain rich and united for 400 years will absolutely eliminate all western soft power and the Chinese culture, language and political thought will dominate the world.So why does China does not have these aspects now? Cause even 10 years ago they were nothing in terms of GDP and wealth. They have not applied their power long enough.But even then you are seeing drastic changes in the last 10 years. Countries that were oppressed by US and the west are now starting to rely on Chinese support. Hezbullah and Iran, who never considered China before, now think it is their lifeline against western onslaught and sanctions. Many African countries also rely on China.There is a lot inertia before a train gets moving. You just have to apply force long enough and it will get faster and faster. Chinese wealth and power is that force that will change mental inertia in the minds of the world. Every year China will get more popular and more respected.Will that mean people who are the current ruling class will hate China? of course! The west and countries that rule certain regions will absolutely hate China. So, countries like India, which rules South Asia hates China. EU also hates China because Chinese power is causing their dominance to fall across the world.But on the other hand countries that are under the suppression of the ruling class love China. Pretty much all Muslim countries love China because for them their biggest enemy is the western domination. China is a natural ally for them to fight that domination.African countries, Latin American countries also love China so that they have a viable alternative to American and European power and market.In conclusion, China doesn’t need to be nice to be popular. they just have to be powerful and maintain that power for another century or two. That is enough to make them extremely popular, respected and worth emulating.China will naturally have soft power in the entertainment industry, language, business, political thought as they continue to get richer and stronger. But they will face strong challenges from the existing Western ruling class who are the beneficiaries of the current world order. They will try to suppress China and try to destroy it. But, if China manages withstand that pressure and still continues to get rich, they will start to change the minds of people in many parts of the world. Chinese language and culture will also start to get more widely popular.Now the big question of this century is, can China get rich while facing the western onslaught? We shall see how it goes.Written byTamsen IkardGeopolitics expertFollowGeopoliticsPoliticsChinaChina Vs UsaPolitical ScienceMore from Tamsen IkardFollowGeopolitics expertMore From MediumWhy India’s push for electric vehicles alone won’t solve its air pollution crisisSiddharth Goel in Rethinking public policy“Airdrop Pervert”: Police in Japan’s Fukuoka Prefecture Make Rare ArrestUnseen JapanWhy Coldwar Steve tells you everything you need to know about modern BritainBen BoothBrexit — The Least Unpalatable OptionSean WelshWith EU divided, Britain won’t need to ‘exit’Rashmee Roshan LallHow social media propelled ethnocentric disinformation and propaganda during the Nigerian electionsGlobal Voices in AdinkraYes, I Do (I Really Don’t)Outbound: تمريدةThe Khashoggi Crisis: A blessing in disguise for Pakistan’s Imran KhanJames M.

Destacando una agenda marcada por la irrupción de la pandemia del Covid-19, quien dibuja un antes y un después en la evaluación de sus actuaciones.Evolución de la valoración media de sus propios votantes/simpatizantes durante la XIV legislaturaSegún ha ido discurriendo estos primeros meses de legislatura, pueden sacarse conclusiones clarividentes que manifiestan la situación de los jefes de los partidos más mayoritarios en número de votos de este país. Una buena forma es testarlo mediante los ojos de aquellos que le apoyan en las urnas.Durante estos primeros siete meses de legislatura, Santiago Abascal obtuvo mayor puntuación por parte de sus parroquianos. Alcanzando un pico de 7.67 puntos. No obstante la caída hasta el mes de junio es de 0.82 puntos en su evaluación media. Convirtiéndole en el líder que más ha caído.Pedro Sánchez, cogió el impulso de sus feligreses en el barómetro especial del Covid-19, ganando 0.74 puntos de media. Aguantando el tirón hasta finalizar el curso como mejor valorado por el electorado propio.Pablo Iglesias, comienza y acaba el curso en segunda posición, con Abascal pisándole los talones.La tendencia de Pablo Casado es menguante. Sin trazas de coger impulso para revertir la situación. El descontento de los devotos del partido del charrán con su adalid adquiere notoriedad.En misma situación parece ubicarse Inés Arrimadas, siendo la peor valorada dentro de la valoración que hace cada votante/simpatizante al líder de sus filas. La sensación de orfandad en Ciudadanos es la más patente de todas.Evolución de la valoración media a Pedro Sánchez según voto/simpatía en la XIV legislaturaDestaca de la valoración a Pedro Sánchez quien no solo recibe la mejor valoración del curso de su propio electorado durante la pandemia, también recibió la mejor estimación de los votantes de PP y VOX.Diferencias en la valoración media de votantes/simpatizantes de Sánchez (I) — resto de partidos (J) durante la XIV legislaturaLa valoración de la actuación de Pedro Sánchez por parte del electorado ajeno, se limita a recibir cada vez mejor estima por parte de los afines a Podemos. Los simpatizantes de PP, VOX y CS cada vez menos estima a Sánchez conforme avanza la legislatura.Evolución de la valoración media a Pablo Casado según voto/simpatía en la XIV legislaturaSi bien la línea de Pablo Casado a tenor de sus simpatizantes es similar al perfil de una insípida etapa del Tour de Francia. Llama la atención que durante el barómetro especial del Covid-19 consigue su mejor valoración por parte del electorado de VOX, Ciudadanos, PSOE y Podemos.Diferencias en la valoración media de votantes/simpatizantes de Casado (I) — resto de partidos (J) durante la XIV legislaturaQue Casado haga gala de que el proyecto político que comanda es de centro-derecha o centro-constitucional o como cada uno prefiera llamarle es cierto. Alardea de ello. Otra cosa es qué electorado ajeno le tiene mayor predilección. Finalizando el curso a una distancia de 2.45 puntos en su valoración media del que se presupone es el partido que más abarca el centro ideológico en este país (Ciudadanos). Por los 1.23 puntos de media que le diferencia al electorado de VOX sobre el del PP.Es por ello interesante indagar si ¿existen diferencias significativas entre predilectos de Casado y Abascal?Mediante las pruebas post hoc nos permite saber dónde encontrar las diferencias pues F de ANOVA o las pruebas robustas sólo permite contrastar hipótesis:H0: µ1 = µ2 = µ3 = µkH1: al menos dos medias son ≠Analizando barómetros desde principios de 2019 hasta el último disponible hasta le fecha (Junio de 2020). En 8 de 16 cuestionarios no existen diferencias significativas en la autoubicación ideológica entre aquellos que prefieren a Pablo Casado como Presidente del Gobierno con respecto a aquellos que prefieren a Santiago Abascal.A día de hoy, los que prefieren a Casado como Presidente se ubican ideológicamente a 1.53 puntos a la derecha con respecto a los que prefieren a Arrimadas. No existiendo diferencias ideológicas significativas entre los predilectos de Casado con respecto a los predilectos de Abascal. Esto es, la media en la ubicación ideológica de sus parroquianos no son diferentes.Diferencias en la valoración media de votantes/simpatizantes de Arrimadas (I) — resto de partidos (J) durante la XIV legislaturaFue reduciendo drásticas diferencias en la valoración media del electorado ajeno hasta el barómetro especial del Covid-19. Desde entonces, los simpatizantes del PSOE y Podemos se acercan más a la estima que le confiere el electorado de Ciudadanos. Por el contrario, los votantes de PP y VOX fueron alejándose más. A día de hoy tiene más estima por Arrimadas el electorado del PSOE que el de VOX.Written byLike DatoFollowPolitical ScienceCovid 19SpainSocial ScienceGgplot2More from Like DatoFollowAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
If Only Trump was as Tech Smart as Hitler,https://medium.com/@scottvern/if-only-trump-was-as-tech-smart-as-hitler-e1c92cc531d8?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Technology,Political Science,World War II,Trump,Economics","While both men have evil intent, Hitler actually did a great job of ushering in new technology, while Trump seems to be oddly obsessed with propping up old technologyHow strange that the Nazis helped beget the Volkswagen Bug and PorscheFirst of all, I apologize for the gratuitous title, but this is the kind of headline that one needs, to be noticed on Medium. Of course I do not want to seem a Hitler apologist in any way, and in fact the premise of the article, that Hitler was tech-smart, may have been accidental (he may have come to power during a golden-age of German tech, facilitated by a war machine). However, isn’t it almost comical to compare the tech successes of the Third Reich (fuel-injection, superior tanks, V-1 and V-2 rockets, and even the Volkswagen) with the sorry tech visions of Trump (resurgence of the sagging coal economy, tariffs on Canadian aluminum to prop up Westinghouse appliances, squelching of energy-efficient devices such as LED light bulbs?) Isn’t there a golden opportunity to bring business back to North America using emerging electronic, energy-saving and non-polluting devices that the rest of the world would want to buy?Hitler, of course, had to do away with some bad technology in order to make way for better technology. If Trump had been in charge of the German WW II war machine, he would have favored the Zeppelin, poisonous gas (which due to weather shifts sometimes killed Germans instead of the enemy), bi wing planes and A7V Tanks (hint: all of these were old tech by WW II). For all we know, he would have kept the mules left over from WW I (to bring out the muleskinner vote). Thankfully for Germany, they fired the old engineers and hired new ones, many of whom became the fathers of the 60s space program (think Werner Von Braun here) and designed the coolest cars of the next generation (Porsche, BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen). He put great Physicists like Heisenberg to work (and even the exiles such as Albert Einstein, made great contributions), while Trump thinks scientists are deep-state elites. Trump seems to think that “jobs” will be created by hanging on to old technology. They are not. You could have fooled yourself in 1880 by thinking that a ban on the steam powered drill would have helped job-security for a bunch of John Henrys, but in fact the steam drill opened up the country for railroads everywhere, and many more jobs (environmental degradation notwithstanding). (Zaloga, 2015)Werner Von Braun was turned loose by a tyrannical madman, but he helped us send men to the moonIf Trump really wanted to bring jobs back to the United States and keep Latinos from crossing the border, here’s what he should have done:1) Realized that a North American coalition (if not a Western Hemisphere coalition) would really help the US more economically than farming so many industries out to Asia. By taking advantage of the vast material resources of Canada, and the cheap labor and of Mexico (and the proximities of both), for instance, the US could have a slightly more expensive, but better quality product.2) By utilizing the relatively cheap but adaptable labor of the right-to-work states (basically the red states), there would be the possibility of assembling complex widgets close to market (us), with materials from Canada, and parts made in Mexico…the best of three worlds.3) There is an enormous developing market for energy-efficient transportation and housing devices. These devices will likely depend on things like 3-d plastic, artificial intelligence, renewable or hydrogen energy sources, HVDC and LEDs, “smart” electronics and the like. The emergence of this technology is inevitable, as it is more efficient and clean. Why on earth would you not promote this technology? It also happens to be the technology that would make weaponry more effective, but of course Trump doesn’t like new tech because it makes him look bad when compared to Obama.4) Strangely, the average red-state Trump follower lives an impoverished existence, while supporting Trump’s anti-union, anti-minimum-wage raising, anti-entitlement safety net rhetoric, but one must ask “why”? If this new tech sector was going wild (ala World War II technology, when they couldn’t find enough aircraft workers and had to hire women and the elderly, and give them benefits in order to do so), then wouldn’t it make sense to give the workers a living wage and medical protections?One of the most famous things that Abraham Lincoln probably didn’t say was “Whatever you are, be a good one”. Trump has even failed miserably at being a good dictator, in the Caesarian, Napoleanic, Hitlerian (and even Genghis Khanian?) sense.5) Of course, American corporations argue that “the American worker is not competitive in today’s world”, but that is a very conditional statement. If you are talking natural resources, we are somewhat competitive, making basic components-not very competitive, but assembly near our markets-very competitive. Look at it this way, China might be able to make photovoltaic cells for $4/hr, but they are far away. Mexico can make them at $6/hr, but they are close. India can assemble the photovoltaics into a panel for $8/hr, but they are half as efficient as the American worker, who can assemble panels for $15/hr, with less shipping. The reality is that American Corporations are after the quick buck and aren’t really vested in the long-term American economy, plus they are always afraid of unionizing. But if American workers were given reasonable wages and benefits (plus exist in right to work states), this possibility would be diminished.6) In any case, why hasn’t Trump developed the basic American advantage, the well-educated American worker? It’s scary how dependent we’ve become on foreign brains, who now make up over 50% of University of California tech grads. Why on earth don’t we crank out more engineers, doctors and nurses (instead of MBAs and Attorneys) to fill this need? Once again, because I suspect that American Corporations feel they can pay foreign tech workers less, and believe they will not unionize (plus they can send H1Bs home whenever they feel like it). Wouldn’t a concentrated STEM program in Jr High and High School make America much more competitive? Don’t ask Trump, he’s probably afraid that too many smart people in this country will vote him and his cronies out.7) A basic 1-yr National Service program, required for every American aged 18 to 25, would go a long- way toward making our workers more competitive. Participants could choose between a type of conservation corps, inner-city renewal programs (including teaching), or military (which might have a 2- year requirement). All participants, man or woman, would have to undergo 8 weeks of “basic training”, which would make them fit and introduce them to the larger world. Each might learn a marketable skill, and perhaps this service would be the prerequisite for a kind of “GI Bill” (ie free college).8) And finally, while we’re at it, can we please ban all foreign call-centers?Is Donald Trump’s great contribution to American tech the rescue of Westinghouse Appliances?Abraham Lincoln once supposedly said “whatever you are, be a good one”. Well, Trump is an unbalanced dictator, but a lousy one. If he were a real unbalanced dictator, he would have made the real American economy (and not the free-money, sugar-high stock market) thrive, like Hitler (Caesar and Napolean) did. Trump is a sorry excuse for a maniacal despot, and if someone doesn’t do something like the above and fast, we will go further down the road of division and stupidity in America (but sadly this may be exactly what the Trump people want). Though he was cruel and insane, at least Hitler had the sensibility to invest in human capital and tech improvement.Written byVern ScottScott has degrees from UC Berkeley, CE ‘79, and SF State Astrophysics ‘88.

An Open Letter to Research and Degrowth,https://medium.com/@chris.jason.conrad/an-open-letter-to-research-degrowth-5dfe3934b096?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Degrowth,Postgrowth,Climate Change,Ecological Economics,Political Science","I’m an undergraduate political science student in the US. In the last year, I’ve consumed a huge chunk of literature on degrowth (probably 1500–2000 pages of books, journal articles, etc). I have deep respect and admiration for the work done by the folks at Research and Degrowth, and I fully believe degrowth (in the global north) is necessary and desirable. This is an open letter to the R&D community and others interested in post-growth economics that I’m writing as an unknown student, with the hopes that someone will hear, and just might listen.I know I’m not academically qualified to make the generalizations I make here — I may have a good GPA, but I’m no PhD, MA, BA, etc — I’m simply writing this letter as a hopeful student who has devoured degrowth literature, but have yet to find a chunk of it that answers the challenging question of how to make our dreams into a reality. On that note, here’s the letter:“Philosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it.”-MarxI want to make a simple argument.Research & Degrowth should shift trajectories, dramatically, as soon as possible. In what direction? Political science research, and direct organizing.Why?We are running out of time.The IPCC’s 2018 report on warming of 1.5 degrees sounded the alarm to the world: the world needs to cut emissions in half by 2030, and to net zero by 2050, to stay within 1.5 degrees C. In the global north, to compensate for its historically disproportionate role in driving emissions, emissions must go to net zero by 2030.Here’s the tough part.If the central thesis of degrowth is correct — that economic growth unavoidably drives ecological destruction and GHG emissions — then we have a little more than 9 years to win.We know that green growth is an impossible fantasy. Material use and emissions are tightly coupled to GDP, and studies that have modeled insane policy responses (a $573 carbon tax plus resource extraction tax) still find that if economic growth continues, material throughput will continue to rise, instead of falling to sustainable levels.In other words, we cannot stop the ecological crisis without degrowth becoming mainstream. And we only have 9 years (give or take) to avoid catastrophic harm (150 million dead from 2 degrees instead of 1.5 C).Degrowth is gaining followers, yes — in the 14 years since Schneider rode a donkey across France, the academic/research community has expanded significantly. But there’s a big gulf between where we are and where we need to be. We cannot afford to spend 14 more years in the ivory tower — we have 9 years to change the world’s opinion of growth (and possibly take down capitalism along the way)!This poses an incredible challenge — the Mont Pelerin Society took 30 years to mainstream neoliberalism, and it had the advantage of being in the interest of capital. Degrowth still has a long way to go, and wants to end capitalism (not exactly a recipe for securing billionaire Koch-brother sponsors!) Growthism is so entrenched that we still argue about whether degrowth is even the right word to use when communicating to the public. Even the furthest left parties see degrowth as politically toxic, they won’t touch it with a 10 foot pole.So, in summary: degrowth is ecologically necessary, but still is far from being mainstream politically acceptable. This must change, and very quickly.How?I have three tentative suggestions.First, degrowth’s research agenda should shift significant attention to questions of political science and sociology. We must ask (and answer) questions about how to win the battle of ideas, how to mobilize tens of millions of people into a social movement advocating degrowth, etc. Put simply, we must engage the vast political science/sociology research on social movement theory to chart ourselves a way to a degrowth world. Having read a significant cross section of the existing research on degrowth, I am struck by the lack of attention given to these questions.I suspect this is a product of degrowth’s intellectual heritage in ecological economics and political ecology — many of the academics have backgrounds in economics or ecology, not social movement theory. So it makes sense that the research has thus far neglected the challenging (but crucial!) question of how the hell we will convince the public to adopt our policy platform. But this must change if we want to have any shot at mainstreaming our ideas in time. I’m hoping to work on these questions for my senior thesis (and possibly if I take the MA program in Barcelona), but it might help if others (more qualified than I) would too.Second, it may be prudent to (partially) leave the ivory tower of academia. If the goal is to mainstream degrowth ideas, energy must be focused on spreading ideas publicly, rather than conducting research that never reaches the public eye. Put simply, greater emphasis should be placed on appealing to ordinary people and policymakers. Perhaps this means writing more books like Hickel’s Less is More or Raworth’s Doughnut Economics. Perhaps it means writing more op-eds for major media outlets, giving more public talks, etc. Perhaps it means securing greater funding for a dedicated think tank, or collaborating with existing progressive think tanks. Too little emphasis is currently placed on communicating to the public.Hopefully, the process of converting degrowth ideas from the language of academia to be publicly accessible will help clarify the many challenges with framing an idea as counterintuitive as degrowth for a general audience. Certainly, framing is another area within the political science/social movement theory umbrella that could use greater research attention (I wrote a paper on this subject that took an initial stab at the question, if you’re interested, it’s here).Third, real time and effort should be invested in organizing. If degrowth is to become mainstream, we must not only win the battle of ideas, we must help build a mass social movement to force politics to abandon the growth imperative.200 years of Marxist theory has not overturned capitalism. But partial victories against capital have been won. Crucially though, as Piketty’s most recent book documents, those victories (universal suffrage for non-property owners, the right to unionize, social democracy in parts of Europe) were the result of mobilization, not benevolent capitalists. Ideas matter, yes — but ideas are not enough. Action is required.To quote Mandela, “It always seems impossible until it’s done.” The end of slavery, universal suffrage, the right to unionize, gay marriage — at the beginning, these battles seemed unwinnable. But if history teaches us one lesson, it’s that social movements — ordinary people mobilizing to demand better — are unstoppable.The last 3 years have seen an unprecedented mobilization by new social movements to deal with the climate crisis (Extinction Rebellion, Sunrise, Fridays for the Future). I hope they win. But if green growth is a myth, then at some point, they will need to be ready to make the hard choice — ecological safety with degrowth, or climate catastrophe with growth.We must be ready to help them.Postscript: I know that many of the folks at R&D and others do devote significant time to public talks, and some to organizing (I met one scholar-activist of this mold when I spent a semester abroad in Copenhagen). And I recognize that the question of strategy has recently been raised at the Vienna Conference. My argument is that these things must be made a more core focus of the existing research/practice — I am not saying these things are not being done at all right now.Written byChristopher ConradFollow21 5 21 21 5 DegrowthPostgrowthClimate ChangeEcological EconomicsPolitical ScienceMore from Christopher ConradFollowMore From MediumFire Season is Year-Round: A New RealityNadin Brzezinski in Age of AwarenessGovernments Cannot Save the Environment.Christopher Balkaran in Strong and FreeSwapping Beef for Plant-Based Protein Could (Literally) Save LivesFast Company in Fast CompanyWhere Plastic Waste is GoldDr. Tracy A.

"Review: Deep Roots: How Slavery Still Shapes Southern Politics by Avidit Acharya, Matthew Blackwell, and Maya Sen",https://medium.com/ballasts-for-the-mind/review-deep-roots-how-slavery-still-shapes-southern-politics-by-avidit-acharya-matthew-a5ce92006534?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Slavery,Political Science,Book Recommendations,Book Review,Politics","In Deep Roots, Avidit Acharya, Matthew Blackwell, and Maya Sen make the argument that the contemporary political views of Southern Whites are shaped by slavery. Specifically they find that Southern Whites in counties that were heavily reliant on slavery (where the 1860 enslaved population in the county was 25% or higher) are more likely to hold racially conservative views such as: feeling cooler about Blacks, being less supportive of Affirmative Action policies, and scoring high on racial resentment. The authors also show that Jim Crow Laws and socialization perpetuated these racially conservative views after slavery ended.The idea that slavery, which ended over 150 years ago, has a predictive impact on how contemporary Southern Whites view racial issues seems a little surprising and not surprising all at the same time. It's probably not surprising if you are a Black Southerner. I know many Black elders and young people in my family and friend circles who would say that the book’s premise makes sense and they could have also told you the same thing from their personal experiences. However, it will seem surprising to others because a lot has changed in the South and we are usually taught that people change and adapt to specific circumstances over time. The authors show using various statistical analyses that behavioral path dependence is the explanation for why slavery has an impact on current Southern White attitudes. The authors defined the term like this “once the culture of a community has moved along a path, it becomes firmly rooted and difficult to reverse or change”, in other words: “History shapes contemporary political culture”. American slavery shaped the contemporary political culture of White Southerners.The authors do a great job using data to show their main findings as well as considering other possible explanations that could explain contemporary Southern White attitudes such as current demographics and migration patterns. As you might guess none of the other explanations have a strong impact as slavery does.The remainder of their book focuses on how Jim Crow and intergenerational socialization helped sustain racially conservative views among Southern Whites. The authors also show what effects civil rights policies and protests, had on racial inequities. They reveal that some inequities have been lessened since the 1960s but that racially conservative attitudes still remain depending on the county they lived in. Students of political science and history will enjoy reading this fascinating book.Ballasts for the MindBook recommendations for your mind and soul.Follow1 Sign up for Ballasts for the Mind DigestBy Ballasts for the MindThis is a monthly newsletter that covers the articles features in this Medium publication as well as other media recommendations.  Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

"<strong class=""bt"">The Imperfections of the Perfect: A Critical Commentary on Theories of Democracy</strong>",https://medium.com/@miercdelacruz/the-imperfections-of-the-perfect-a-critical-commentary-on-theories-of-democracy-368c9b5315f4?source=tag_archive---------2-----------------------,"Democracy,Philippine Politics,Politics,Political Theory,Political Science","By Mier Airish C. Dela CruzAugust 13, 2020Democracy is a universally contested concept throughout time. Although it has been deemed as the pinnacle of all types of regimes, democracy’s definition and essence are debated by political philosophers coming from the Greeks to the contemporary period. In general, democracy is defined as a regime type that “involves the selection of government officials through free and fair elections, a balance between the principle of majority rule and the protection of minority interests, and constitutional limitations on government actions” (Barrington, 2012). However, the infamous incidents posed by democracy challenge its desirability as a regime because they manifest loopholes that bring predicaments not only to individuals but also to societies as a whole. These incidents spark critical discussions and objective analyses that step out of the circle of subjectivity brought by the trademark of democracy as a symbol of freedom.One of the prominent political philosophers, Aristotle, defined democracy as the flawed rule of the many. Because it is a regime type that provides the people with the right to vote for their preferred set of leaders through elections, democracy becomes a competition of quantity over quality (Curtis, 2008). In fact, Aristotle favored aristocracy, a form of government ruled by the best over the rest based on merit rather than blood. This is because in a democracy, the ultimate power resides on the will of the majority, not the law, not the state. In this case, a regime that allows people to do whatever they want, especially in elections, is in fact flawed, for it is not guiding them toward a path we envision for our society.Further aggravating the issue, the emotional attachment of societies to democracy strengthened the reverie of the people to a democratic society. This attachment was brought by the regime transitions experienced by difference states, particularly by the liberalization movement (Huntington, 1993). From observing a non-democratic system to a more open and less repressive political system, the liberalization movement paved way for states to undergo the stages of democratization: 1) breakdown of nondemocracy, 2) establishment of democracy, and 3) consolidation of democracy. And because the liberalization movement has been a symbol of freedom against monarchs, tyrants, and dictators, democracy, which supposedly promotes a government of, by, and for the people, was celebrated and adopted as a political system run by the people. However, Aristotle’s doubt in democracy still in fact resonates to the contemporary period even though he lived centuries ago. In the Philippines, the flaws of democracy are present not only in its electoral system but also in the administrative job of the government itself.Political participation, in the form of representative democracy, is present through elections, which is considered as the backbone of traditional democracy. Although the citizenry is given the power to participate in public affairs, the constituents are given the opportunity to directly participate in in the selection of individuals or parties seeking political office. Moreover, an election is a form of traditional mass participation in a democracy where it gives the opportunity to the citizens the freedom to participate in choosing their set of leaders. However, in the Philippines, for instance, where First Past The Post (FPTP) electoral system is observed, mass participation can be deemed as a mere representation as it only needs a plurality rule (Heywood, 2014). This means that a candidate can win an election even if not majority (50% + 1) of the population participated in the elections. Therefore, direct participation is assumed, but it can come out as a mere representation by its electoral process. Since liberal democracy imposes the inherent liberty of individuals, participation should be both expected and unexpected as we ought to respect the freedom of individuals to act on their preferences rather than being obliged by an institution, while observing the presence of democracy. This means that an individual can choose both to vote and not to vote; they are expected to do so, but are not required to do so. Thus, political participation in a liberal democracy can come off ineffective because the citizens’ participation is not institutionally checked and regulated because of the idea of less government control.Another prominent issue in democracy is the idea of tyranny of the many. Because the people will get to decide who they want to elect, the competition now is based on quantity over quality. In elections, a candidate does not have to meet any extensive standard in running for public office as long as s/he can obtain enough votes to win the elections, and of course if s/he meets the standard requirements such as 1) be a natural-born citizen of the Philippines, 2) a registered voter (in the case of district representatives, registered in the district where he or she will run), and 3) able to read and write. A great example of this would be the recent 2019 senatorial elections where Lito Lapid, a high school graduate, won over Chel Diokno, a veteran lawyer. Although Lapid has previous political experiences as a senator, it is perhaps rational to say that an experienced lawyer can perform better because of his background in the law and public administration.Another loophole in democracy is the occurrence of government paralysis, which has been prominent as democracy gave birth to pluralism. Since democracy embodies a government of, by, and for the people, pluralism emphasizes the existence of interest groups (non-governmental groups) that can mobilize their resources to exert influence on the government. Classical pluralism posits that the state is a neutral arbiter of competing interests. However, in the Philippines, what is present is elite pluralism, which asserts that the elites dominate the policymaking process because of their exertion of pressure using their tremendous amount of resources (Teehankee, 2018). A prominent example of this is the Aquinos and the Cojuancos regarding the Hacienda Luisita issue back in the Cory Aquino administration. The two contending interest groups here are the farmers and the Cojuancos, where the former fought for their rights and the latter for their private property. Both Aquinos and Cojuancos faced criticisms as the latter controlled 70% of the stock shares and property of the Hacienda while only 30% of stock shares were given to the farmers in virtue of Cory’s Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (Saulo-Adriano, 1991). The said program, signed into the law as Republic Act №6657 or the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARL), aimed to redistribute the private and public agricultural lands to help independent farmers and their beneficiaries. However, as aforementioned, only 30% of the stocks were provided to the farmers, not full ownership of the lands and of the stocks. This is a manifestation of an insincere redistribution of property as the law favored more than half of the percentage of ownership to the oligarchs instead of giving it fully to the farmers, or even at least leveling the percentage to a 50–50 percent ownership. Lastly, a living proof of this flawed oligarchic law is the land reform movements that had occurred throughout its implementation. Incidents such as strikes by the United Luisita Workers Union (ULWU) and the Central Azucarera de Tarlac Labor Union (CATLU) and the infamous Hacienda Luisita Massacre are proofs of the outcry of the mass regarding this unjust law. Thus, oligarchs who have a connection or a tremendous influence to public policymakers influence the outcome of the laws being signed, most especially, as manifested in this scenario, if the oligarch is related by blood to the lawmakers. The policymaker, being connected to an oligarch, formulates its laws whose content are unrelated or far-fetched from the demands of the constituents just to appease the oligarchs.Democracy also gave birth to the concept of deliberative democracy. Deliberative democracy posits that political decisions must be a product of fair and rational discussions and debate among its citizens (Cunningham, 2002). However, deliberative democracy only works when the political issues being raised can be backed up by science and reason. A great example is the groundbreaking Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012, commonly known as the RH Law. It was so controversial that the country was then divided almost into two: the religious and the scientific community. Being a predominantly religious country, the Philippines had a difficult debate separating one’s culture from rationality. The constraining condition here is how the government has imposed a bill-now-law backed up by rationality and science that contradicts the predominant culture of the Filipinos, when in fact as public policymakers the lawmakers should have listened to the public demands. However, not all political issues can be backed up by such, which is why deliberative democracy only works on certain political issues. And reason may be fueled by political agendas that only serves the interest of a few. While the idea of deliberative democracy is promising, sometimes it might fail to look at us human beings as self-interested individuals and the true nature of politics which is an arena of political contestation (rational choice theory and pluralist theory, for instance). For instance, how can science and rationality back up the need — and demand — to legislate an anti-dynasty law that stops the proliferation of political dynasties in the country?To end, “there never will be a perfect state or constitution”, said by one of the greatest philosophers of all time, Plato. Even if democracy gave us the freedom we have now, we still must assess its desirability as a regime — if it functions well in serving the people. As Joel Wolfe has directly stated, a “strong democracy should be a form of government in which all people participate in decision-making and implementation. While recognizing that the complexity of modern society imposes limits on direct democracy, participation by all is imperative because it creates shared interests, a common will, and community action, all of which inevitably give legitimacy to politics.” With all the aforementioned infamous incidents stated, it is time to remove our blindfolds and ask ourselves the questions we have long been evading: is democracy really the flawed rule of the many? Does our freedom come with such consequences? And, if democracy is the pinnacle of all regime types, does it serve the best interest of the people, or has it been weaponized to actualize the self-interest of certain individuals? Now more than ever, we have to spark critical discussions and objective analyses that step out of the circle of subjectivity brought by the trademark of democracy as a symbol of freedom.References:Barrington, L.

Trump watches over six hours of Fox News a day, a habit his staff refers to as “executive time.” In January 2020, when Fox News began to downplay COVID-19, the President was quick to agree. In March, as the deadly virus spiraled out of control, Sean Hannity mocked “coronavirus hysteria” as a “new hoax” from the left. Millions of Americans took Hannity and Trump’s words as truth — until some of them started to get sick.In Hoax, CNN anchor and chief media correspondent Brian Stelter tells the twisted story of the relationship between Donald Trump and Fox News. From the moment Trump glided down the golden escalator to announce his candidacy in the 2016 presidential election to his acquittal on two articles of impeachment in early 2020, Fox hosts spread his lies and smeared his enemies. Over the course of two years, Stelter spoke with over 250 current and former Fox insiders in an effort to understand the inner workings of Rupert Murdoch’s multibillion-dollar media empire. Some of the confessions are alarming. “We don’t really believe all this stuff,” a producer says. “We just tell other people to believe it.”At the center of the story lies Sean Hannity, a college dropout who, following the death of Fox News mastermind Roger Ailes, reigns supreme at the network that pays him $30 million a year. Stelter describes the raging tensions inside Fox between the Trump loyalists and the few remaining journalists. He reveals why former chief news anchor Shep Smith resigned in disgust in 2019; why a former anchor said “if I stay here I’ll get cancer;” and how Trump has exploited the leadership vacuum at the top to effectively seize control of the network.Including never before reported details, Hoax exposes the media personalities who, though morally bankrupt, profit outrageously by promoting the President’s propaganda and radicalizing the American right.

Why Not Socialism? An Analysis of Gerald Cohen’s Utopia,https://medium.com/@ava.meier/why-not-socialism-an-analysis-of-gerald-cohens-utopia-a8751471d215?source=tag_archive---------4-----------------------,"Politics,Utopia,Economics,Socialism,Political Science","Gerald Cohen’s Why Not Socialism provides an interesting and rather convincing account for the adoption of a socialist conception of distributive justice and market organization. His aim here is not to clearly spell out how we, as a society entrenched in centuries if capitalist ethos, can practically and pragmatically move to a socialist state, but rather, his aim is to highlight that it is a project worth theorizing and considering.For Cohen, there are two fundamental principles on which socialism is grounded. The first is an egalitarian principle coined the socialist equality of opportunity which “seeks to correct for all unchosen disadvantages, disadvantages that is, for which the agent cannot herself reasonably be held responsible, whether they be disadvantages that reflect social misfortune or disadvantages that reflect natural misfortune” (p. 18). This can be further categorized into three different types of equal opportunity. The first is bourgeois equal opportunity which constitutes both formal and informal socially constructed status restrictions on life chances.The second is left-liberal equality of opportunity which eliminates the constraining effect of social circumstances, or in other words, “those circumstances of birth and upbringing that constrain not by assigning an inferior status to their victims, but by nevertheless causing them to labour and live under substantial disadvantage” (p.19).The third and last principle of socialist equality of opportunity is just that, equality of opportunity, defined as the removal of all unchosen disadvantages on life chances, including those that result from natural misfortune.Despite these principles, the overarching egalitarian socialist equality of opportunity principle still allows for three types of inequalities that arise either from “variety of preference and choice across lifestyles”, or in other words a difference in goods and services; from regrettable choice; and from option luck. On the difference in goods inequality, Cohen writes: “people differ in their tastes, not only across consumer items, but also between working only a few hours and consuming rather little on the one hand, and working long hours and consuming rather more on the other…[and] there can be no obligations to differences in people’s benefits and burdens that reflect nothing but different preferences when (which is not always) their satisfaction leads to a comparable aggregate enjoyment of life” (p. 18–19). Alternately, regrettable choice refers to inequalities of aggregate benefit due to “differential exercises of effort and/or care by people, who are, initially, absolutely equally placed, and who are equal even in their capacities to expend effort and care” (p. 27). Lastly, option luck refers to inequalities that result from taking a reasonable gamble, whether winning or losing.That said, these inequalities identified by Cohen as existing paradoxically to the central tenet of socialism, are curbed, or at the very least restrained by some degree, by Cohen’s secondary principle, that of social community which emphasizes communal reciprocity as a motivator in the place of market-fueled greed and fear. Although this notion of reciprocity is not central to the workings of a socialist market, it still remains of value, Cohen argues, for forming and maintaining desirable human relationships, for “communal reciprocity is the anti-market principle according to which I serve you not because of what I can get in return by doing so, but because you need or want my service, and you, for the same reason, serve me” (p. 39).Overall, I believe Cohen does offer a compelling proposition, an alternative way to organize economic and political life that does not necessarily involve a trade-off between efficiency and quality of life. What Cohen attempts to achieve in this book is a fundamental refocusing of what socialism means and necessitates, rather than defining it in terms of several historical projects, such as Soviet Russia and China, that attempted variants of market socialism against a backdrop of an ever-expanding global capitalist matrix. That is not to say that these cases, or more broadly, market socialism, do not provide fodder for reflection. Instead, they serve as stepping stones from which we can hope to find an answer to the proverbial rock and hard place that is centralized planning, and market injustices and motivations. Cohen’s purpose of this book is not to spell out how we can arrive at such a system, that is all the while efficient as it is just, but is to, hopefully, dispel the commonly held belief that socialism is not only undesirable, but also unfeasible. Through his camping trip analogy and extrapolation to the greater complexities of social and economic daily life, Cohen produces a thought-provoking argument that urges reads to reconsider socialism not in the light that it has played out historically and albeit failed, but to realize the value it holds in creating a more just and equitable society that is not administered on the basis of differential claims to the marketplace and worth, and fueled by greed and fear, but on the basis of a shared humanity and dignity common to us all. Cohen admits that he does not know the best route to harness this generosity into an efficient economic machine, but this is also not his point. His point, rather, is to allow us to reconsider not how to structure said system, which he views is the most fundamental problem facing the socialist ideal — “a problem of design” — but that human selfishness is not the only way to organize life around. It is but one value of a multitude that we have chosen to exploit, albeit very well so, but nonetheless, one out of many. Cohen provides a convincing argument for selecting other values to organize around, namely community, which is hallmarked by a genuine care for one another, in conjunction with the realized benefits of establishing market prices. In other words, he is essentially asking, “Can we have market efficiency in production without market incentives and, hence, without a market distribution of rewards [i.e. inequalities in aggregate benefits]?” (p. 62–63).Like Cohen, I believe this is a question worth exploring, not for its complexities in design and utopian leaning methods of implementation and whether those can be realistically feasible, but for the sake of creating a more just society that organizes around a consensus that human nature is not exclusively dominated by self-interest, which has been socially constructed and reproduced over centuries as such, but one that has a great capacity for care and generosity that extends beyond an individual’s immediate circle of kin and friends, applying itself to fellow members of the greater social milieu as well.Written byA.

The Other Side Is More Rational Than You Think,https://arcdigital.media/the-other-side-is-more-rational-than-you-think-2137349204c7?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Politics,Polarization,Political Science,Psychology,Philosophy","(Getty/Arc)Polarization is rising in the United States. We all know it. We can sense it. Beyond our own impressions, it’s what the data clearly tells us. Year by year, members of each party agree more amongst themselves, and less with the other side. As a result, they increasingly demonize the other side. From 1994 to 2016, the percentage of Republicans with “very unfavorable” attitudes toward the Democratic Party rose from 21 percent to 58 percent, with a whopping 91 percent having an overall “unfavorable” attitude. The numbers for Democrats are similar.Why is this happening? It has become commonplace to point to irrational causes as the drivers of polarization: people are subject to reasoning errors like confirmation bias, motivated reasoning, identity-protective cognition, biased assimilation of evidence, and so on.What we are told is that these biases have led people to misuse the internet: they tend to look only at news sources that agree with their beliefs, to share and promote only articles that confirm them, to talk with and trust only those who agree with them, and so on. And that, we are told, is why we are polarized.Hateful HobbyistsReview of Politics is for Power by Eitan Hersh and Why We’re Polarized by Ezra Kleinarcdigital.mediaThis irrationalist explanation of polarization is familiar and intuitive.It’s also wrong.There’s a simple and compelling argument that we can’t view polarization as due primarily to irrational causes.To see why, take some political belief on which Americans are sharply polarized — say, whether Trump is doing a good job. (Current polling: Republicans: 92 percent; Democrats: 4 percent.) For the sake of argument, let’s imagine you think he’s not doing a good job.Now ask yourself: how did you form this opinion about Trump? I’m guessing you won’t say: “Due to confirmation bias and motivated reasoning, I listened primarily to sources that told me what I wanted to hear, and discredited information that suggested otherwise. That’s why I came to think he’s doing a bad job.”You won’t say that because you can’t believe that. Put bluntly: it’s incoherent to think, “Trump’s doing a bad job — but I’m irrational to believe that.” After all, you can’t believe that your own beliefs are irrational. More generally: to the extent that you think your confidence in your opinions is irrationally placed, you must become less confident in those opinions.This means that if you are to hold onto your political beliefs, then you must think that you formed them in a largely rational way. (As, I imagine, you do.)Human Beings Are Intrinsically Tribal. So Of Course Our Politics Will Also Be.Amy Chua on the inherently tribal nature of American politicsarcdigital.mediaBy extension, you must think similarly about those who agree with you on politics. For no one can sensibly think to themselves, “I formed my beliefs rationally — but all my friends, who agree with me and formed their beliefs in similar ways, did so irrationally.” That means that you must think that those on your side of the political divide formed their opinions, by and large, rationally.Here’s the catch: the evidence is resounding that the mechanisms that drive polarization — confirmation bias, motivated reasoning, biased assimilation, and so on — are bipartisan: both sides are equally susceptible to them.That means that the other side formed their beliefs through the same processes that your side did. We’ve seen that you can’t believe your side is irrational. So it follows that you shouldn’t think the other side is, either.That’s not to say you shouldn’t think they’re wrong. You should. After all, your belief that Trump’s not doing a good job was rationally formed. The other side believes that he is doing a good job. Their belief is inconsistent with yours. So you should think that their belief is wrong.But just because you think it’s wrong doesn’t mean you need to think it was formed irrationally. As we’ve seen, you shouldn’t think that — at least, not if you want to both hold onto your own belief and respect the psychological evidence.Of course, you might try to point to various asymmetries between the parties to justify thinking the other side is less rational than you. Trump is, indeed — how do I put this softly? — more erratic than Democratic leaders. AOC is, indeed, a socialist — which is, to many Republicans, a stronger pejorative. And so on. There are plenty of differences between the parties.The trouble is, those differences aren’t what make the difference. Let me explain.We know what psychological mechanisms drive people to polarize: confirmation bias, motivated reasoning, selective exposure to news and opinions, and so on. As we’ve seen, such mechanisms are not correlated with the various asymmetries between the parties. This means you shouldn’t use such partisan asymmetries to conclude that the other side is less rational than yours. What, then, should you conclude?You should conclude that those asymmetries explain why the other side has been misled. Rational mechanisms — the same ones that have led you to your beliefs — have led them to see very different information, to interpret shared information in very different ways, and so on. Fortunately, these processes have led you to the truth about Trump. Unfortunately, they have led them away from it. (They, of course, should draw the exact opposite conclusion.)Why Polarization Won’t Go AwayMost people agree that politics has become too hostile, toxic, and polarized. So why does it remain that way?arcdigital.mediaThat is what you should think about our polarized politics. But can you? Is this story consistent with the empirical evidence about polarization?Yes. The standard irrationalist narrative consists of two parts. Part 1 is an empirical account of the mechanisms (“confirmation bias”, etc.) that drive polarization. Part 2 is a normative interpretation of those mechanisms — in particular, the claim that they are irrational.Part 1 is well-confirmed by a plethora of empirical research. Part 2 is not. In fact, it consists largely of empirical researchers applying over-simplified models of rationality to their data, and concluding that the way people reason in these scenarios is not the way rational people would reason in them.Thus we can accept Part 1 and deny Part 2. That is: we can agree that “confirmation bias,” “motivated reasoning,” and the like are what lead to polarization, and deny that such processes are necessarily irrational. In fact, it turns out that all of these “biases” are to be expected from rational people who care about the truth but face systematically ambiguous evidence.This story of rational polarization is one we can believe. For it allows us to hold onto our political beliefs, since it doesn’t require us to think they are irrational. The catch? We must think that the other side is rational to hold onto their beliefs as well — even though (we think) those beliefs are wrong.Viral Politics in an Age of Hyper-PolarizationNot even pandemics seem capable of dissolving our political differencesarcdigital.mediaSuppose we buy this new, rational story of polarization. What does it imply? Two things.First, it implies that we are in a sort of tragedy: individually rational processes are collectively pulling us apart. That means the way to reduce polarization is not to make individuals more rational consumers of information — they are already doing the best that can be expected. Rather, any successful solution will require changing the structure of our interactions to tamp down on the differential spread of ambiguous and misleading information.Second, it implies that we shouldn’t blame our political opponents for believing as they do. We can — we should — think they are wrong; but we shouldn’t think they are wrong for irrational or biased reasons. Instead, we should think they are doing the best they can with the (mis)information they have.We’re Not Doomed To Be PolarizedA Democrat, a Republican, and a search for common groundarcdigital.mediaThis, I think, should be welcome news. For if we all recognize that the other side is no less rational than our own, that may go some way toward easing the inter-party demonization that is the true tragedy of American polarization.Arc DigitalThe internet’s best opinion pageFollow569 24 PoliticsPolarizationPolitical SciencePsychologyPhilosophy569 claps569 claps24 responsesWritten byKevin DorstFollowPhilosopher at Oxford working on the question of how irrational we truly are.FollowArc DigitalFollowThe internet’s best opinion pageFollowWritten byKevin DorstFollowPhilosopher at Oxford working on the question of how irrational we truly are.Arc DigitalFollowThe internet’s best opinion pageMore From MediumThis Is Fine.

Our recent research in Europe, for instance, explored how political polarization in the region shapes long-standing debates about domestic, social and economic policies.To measure political ideology, our international questionnaires typically ask respondents to place themselves on a 7-point scale with two labeled endpoints (or anchors) — “extreme left” and “extreme right” — along with numbers for all of the points in between. However, some research suggests that it’s easier for respondents to understand a fully labeled scale, one that includes descriptions for the interior points as well, such as “leaning left,” “leaning right,” or “center.” In this post, we’ll describe a survey experiment we conducted to find out if two approaches to measuring the same concept align with — or diverge from — each other.Findings at a glanceOur survey experiment was part of nationally representative telephone surveys we fielded in France, Spain and the United Kingdom in the spring of 2018. (You can read about an earlier experiment related to survey scales in this Decoded post.)The 2018 surveys asked about political ideology in two ways. First, midway through each interview, respondents were asked the Center’s standard ideology question using a 7-point numeric response scale with only the endpoints labeled. Then, after several more questions, respondents were asked to describe themselves using a fully labeled, 5-point scale.Here are some of the trends we observed across all three countries:· The most common response option for both scales was the midpoint, though a greater share of respondents chose the midpoint on the 7-point scale (“3”) than on the 5-point scale (“center”).· More respondents identified as right of center on the 7-point scale but left of center on the 5-point scale.· Respondents were more likely to choose the endpoints on the 5-point scale than on the 7-point scale, and this was especially true for those on the ideological left.· Levels of item nonresponse (either “don’t know” or refusal to answer) were similar using both approaches.A closer look at France using Sankey diagramsThese aggregate numbers don’t tell the whole story. Fortunately, we can go a step further with our experimental data. By asking all respondents to answer both versions of our ideology question, we can also see how each respondent answered — or “moved” — from one question to the other.To illustrate these patterns, we created Sankey diagrams for each country using the R package ggalluvial. These graphs are a type of flow diagram that illustrate the movement from one category to the next — in this case, from the 7-point scale to the 5-point version. The band thickness in Sankey diagrams indicates the number of people taking a particular path, with thicker bands showing the more common pathways between two points on our different scales. (We should note at the outset that this part of our analysis does not include respondents who answered “don’t know” or refused to respond. It is limited to the 2,625 respondents who answered both ideology questions, including 846 in France, 935 in Spain and 844 in the UK.)In the graph on the left, we’ll focus on French respondents who answered “0 — Extreme left” on the ideology question using the 7-point scale. Of the 55 French respondents who reported “0 — Extreme left,” most of them (31) chose “left” when later asked to identify their political ideology using the 5-point scale. These respondents are represented by the highlighted horizontal line straight across the top of the chart.But what about the 24 other people in France who chose the “0 — Extreme left” option? These respondents are represented by three narrower bands that start at “0 — Extreme left” and then slide down and to the right in the chart. Overall, most of these respondents (18) chose “leaning left.” Far fewer moved to “center” (five respondents) or “right” (one respondent). None of the respondents who answered “0 — Extreme left” on the 7-point scale reported “leaning right” on the 5-point scale.The full range of patterns between the two scales in France is provided in the next Sankey diagram, with the path of each combination of responses illustrated by a different color.A few trends emerge in this graph:· About half of the respondents (53%) who selected the midpoint on the 7-point scale also chose “center” on the 5-point scale, as illustrated by the thickest yellow band connecting “3” to “center.” Among those who chose the midpoint on the 7-point scale but did not choose “center” on the 5-point scale, roughly twice as many placed themselves left of center than right of center: 31% versus 17%.· Nine-in-ten (90%) of those on the left of the 7-point scale identified as left of center on the 5-point scale as well, as illustrated by nearly all of the blue bands above the midpoint moving to either “left” or “leaning left.” Overall, 7% of those who characterized their ideology as left of center on the 7-point scale moved to “center” on the 5-point scale, while 3% moved to “leaning right” or “right.”· Around two-thirds of respondents (66%) who placed themselves on the right of the 7-point scale also chose “right” or “leaning right” on the 5-point scale. Surprisingly, more of those who identified as right of center on the 7-point scale identified as “left” or “leaning left” on the 5-point scale (21%) than moved to the center (13%). This is shown by the similarly sized orange and red paths heading to “left,” “leaning left,” and “center.”· Of the 35 possible response combinations between questions, no respondents in France answered “0 — Extreme left” on the 7-point scale and later identified as “leaning right” on the 5-point scale, or answered “1” and then identified as “center” or “leaning right.”Cross-national results from the experimentSankey diagrams can also be helpful to illustrate and better understand cross-national patterns in our three selected countries. As the next chart shows, several of the broad trends we observed in France are apparent in Spain and the UK as well:Here’s a closer look at what’s happening in this chart:· Across all three countries, most respondents who chose the midpoint on the 7-point scale also chose “center” on the 5-point scale (53% in France, 52% in Spain and 59% in the UK). And just as in France, more people moved from the midpoint of the 7-point scale to left of center on the 5-point scale than moved to the right on the 5-point scale.· In all three countries, the overwhelming majority of those who placed themselves on the left of the 7-point scale also identified as left of center on the 5-point scale (90% in France, 94% in Spain and 89% in the UK).· There is more variability among those who placed themselves on the right of the 7-point scale. While 66% of those on the ideological right in France also placed themselves on the right of the 5-point scale, the share who did so was lower in both Spain (52%) and the UK (61%). Respondents on the ideological right of the 7-point scale in Spain and the UK were more likely than their counterparts in France to move to the center on the 5-point scale (26% in Spain and 25% in the UK versus 13% in France).· As was the case in France, a few combinations of responses were not found in Spain and the UK. No respondents in Spain answered “0 — Extreme left” and then “center” or “leaning right,” or, in another combination, “1” and then a right-of-center response. Similarly, in the UK, no respondents first answered “0 — Extreme left” or “1” and then “right.”As illustrated in the Sankey diagrams, there is general ideological consistency at the individual respondent level between the two survey questions, with only a limited share of people in each country providing apparently contradictory answers. In fact, only 11 of our 2,625 respondents provided the opposite extremes to the two scales (“0-Extreme left” and right or “6-Extreme right” and left). The robustness of these measures across countries suggests that both items can be useful in estimating political ideology. Across countries, our respondents behaved similarly, but not exactly the same. This is reflected in the subtle variability in responses to these two questions that are seemingly measuring the same thing.Concluding thoughtsBoth scales have benefits. A 5-point, fully labeled scale allows respondents to identify with a qualitative description of their political leaning, while a 7-point, endpoint labeled scale provides respondents with more choices to select a position closest to their political ideology. While the two survey questions are different in scale size and wording, respondents across countries answered them in similar patterns, giving us confidence in both when conducting cross-country comparisons.There are several caveats, however. The experiment relied on relatively small samples that limited our findings in a few ways. For example, we could not conduct robust analyses across all possible answer combinations because some were too infrequent and others nonexistent. And while some respondents answered with “don’t know” or refused to answer at all, the number of people who did so was relatively small, limiting our ability to draw inferences about this group.Aside from sample size, there are a few other issues we would consider expanding upon in future experiments. For instance, we did not rotate question order to examine whether replying to the first ideology question affected respondents’ answers to the second question or subsequent items. Also, we tested only two response scales, which means we could not assess the merits of other permutations, such as the results of a fully labeled, 7-point scale or a numeric, endpoint-labeled 5-point scale.Finally, the questions we tested weren’t equivalent. The Center’s standard political ideology question includes the words “extreme” (in the 7-point scale itself) and “center” (in the question stem), but this is not the case in the alternative 5-point scale and associated question. Additional experimental conditions — say, keeping the scale length the same but testing different wordings, or vice versa — would allow us to disentangle these effects.To dig deeper, it might be useful to look beyond the survey results. It’s possible some respondents were confused when we asked for their political ideology twice, so one way to explore the issue would be to incorporate cognitive interviewing in future experiments. This may help researchers better understand the meaning of survey questions, including questions that ask about the same underlying concept, from a respondent’s point of view.In the meantime, we plan to use the data from this experiment to further study whether one of these ideology questions is a more accurate or valid measure than the other. Comparing each question with other items asked in our surveys — such as respondents’ political party affiliation or their opinions on highly politicized topics — would provide additional insights, with the help of Sankey diagrams to visualize the results.This post was written by Martha McRoy and Stacy Pancratz.

When Futurism Gets Stuck in the Past,https://medium.com/curious/when-futurism-gets-stuck-in-the-past-6052294ea579?source=tag_archive---------2-----------------------,"Futurism,World Government,Enlightenment,Universalism,Political Science","The western historical imagination has been haunted by the collapse of the Roman Empire, here illustrated by Thomas Cole in his painting “Desolation” (1836) from the series “The Course of Empire”Ever since I first became interested in futurism in the 1970s, and I began to read everything I could find on futurism, I noticed the almost exclusive interest in world government as the political paradigm of futurism, and even at the time I thought it was odd. I still find it odd today, and so I have gone looking for explanations for the political monoculture of futurism. Let me begin with a speculation — nothing that I consider to be definitive, but only one possible explanation among many — and after my speculation I will move on to a more analytical understanding of the world government paradigm in futurism.Historical thought in western civilization is haunted by the collapse of the Roman Empire. The Romans expanded their political control over the entirety of the Mediterranean Basin and maintained this universal empire for hundreds of years. If we take Rome from its foundation to its last effective presence at Byzantium, its history can be measured in millennia, like Ancient Egyptian civilization. Western historians always have, in their back of their minds, the cautionary tale of Rome: a single, universal civilization effectively dominating the known world, utterly failing and leaving in its wake confusion, social collapse, conflict, and Balkanization. This cautionary tale is often understood as a moral lesson for our time (cf. Manifest Destiny: Roman and American).No historical narrative that summarizes thousands of years of history into some neat schema could ever be quite true; it is an oversimplification in order to give us a “big picture” view of the trajectory of western civilization, but oversimplifications have their place, side-by-side with soporific detail. Either approach risks alienating some part of the audience, which audience is us, today, inheriting these historical traditions at the same time as we look forward into the future.It is possible that this oversimplified narrative of Roman expansion, overextension, decline, and failure is the source of the idée fixe of world government in futurism. World government is what was effectively lost when the western Roman Empire failed, and western civilization ever since that time can be understood as the conscious or unconscious attempt to recover that lost world government of the Roman imperium. Dante was quite explicit about this in his pamphlet De Monarchia (often translated into English as On World Government).Whether or not the explanation of the world government idée fixe ultimately is to be derived from the western historical imagination being haunted by the specter of Roman collapse, or is due to some other cause, is not ultimately decisive; it may bear upon the question and its eventual resolution, but I do not think it will be decisive. So let us widen our scope and consider three other sources of the intellectual fixation on world government; specifically, let us consider three ideas that loom large in the idea of world government, even if these ideas are not often made explicit:The Political IdeaThe Planetary IdeaThe Universalist IdeaWe will take up each of these in turn.The Political IdeaIf we understand civilization to be a form of social organization, and we understand social organization to be intrinsically and essentially political, then it follows that civilization is intrinsically and essentially political. In brief, civilization is a political phenomenon. And one can further conclude that, when the scattered and diverse civilizations of our homeworld began to grow together in a planetary concrescence, because the world entire is settled and populated, then the emergent planetary civilization, being intrinsically and essentially political, should also be converging on a common planetary political framework. The scattered and diverse political structures of the once numerous civilization of our world would, it seems, also grow together into a planetary concrescence of political institutions.If, on the other hand, one denies that civilization is intrinsically and essentially political, then the growing together of civilizations originally separate does not necessarily entail the growing together of political regimes originally separate. Civililzation may become planetary (arguably, it is already planetary at this time), but since civilization is not intrinsically or essentially political, the planetary scale of civilization does not entail planetary scale political institutions.The relationship of civilization to political order is a complex one, so that one might argue either side of the question and be able to produce historical examples of either the coincidence of civilization and political order, or the divergence of civilization and political order. Clearly, one of the emergent properties of civilization has been the emergence of sophisticated political institutions. This has been necessary because civilizations join together a far larger number of individuals than can be found in a nomadic band of hunter-gatherers, a tribe, or a clan, which usually increase to the number of individuals with whom stable social relationships are possible (known as Dunbar’s number), and fission thereafter. The institutions of civilization are a “work around” for the limitations imposed by Dunbar’s number.However, emergent political institutions of civilization do not necessarily entail top-down unification of peoples in relation to some central authority (and the idea that the unified peoples inhabit a particular geographical territory is a later artifact of the territorial principle in law, which more or less corresponds with the origins of the nation-state). One of the most familiar forms that civilization takes is that of a network of cities bound in relationships of cooperation, competition, and conflict with one another (I call this my pragmatic definition of civilization), all cities of which network share in a common civilization, but not a common government. We find this pattern among the cities of ancient Mesopotamia, swept now into one empire, and then later into another, and we find the same pattern among the Mayan cities of ancient Mesoamerica, as well as among the many cities of the Indus Valley civilization, and so on. We understand that when Siyaj Kʼakʼ installed Yax Nuun Ahiin I as king of Tikal in 379 AD that this was a political struggle internal to Mayan civilization and that it does not represent the conquest of one civilization by another.I argue that the identification of civilization with a (single) political regime is reductionist, since civilization is a much more comprehensive conception than that of political order, as seen from rival political orders contending for power within one and the same civilization. That some civilizations have been unified on an imperial basis (e.g., ancient Egypt after the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt about 3100 BC, and China throughout much of its history since Ying Zheng founded the Qin Dynasty after the Warring States period) demonstrates only that imperial unification of one civilization into a single political order is one possibility among many possible political orders that might hold within a given civilization.The Planetary IdeaIn the distant past, when there were far fewer human beings, the size of Earth was sufficient to be effectively indefinite in extent. Small bands of hunter-gatherers could wander for generations, crossing paths with other bands, but with any band able to seek its own uncontested territory if only that band were willing to migrate further than its neighbors. As noted in the above section, nomadic bands fell well within the limits of Dunbar’s number, and as this number was approached by a growing band, that band could fission and the resulting two or more bands would then be free to go their separate ways, maintaining the effective social order.Later, when civilizations began to appear — and even before that when nomadic bands began to settle down into patterns of village agriculture — still Earth was large enough that civilizations could expand to the extent of their ability, sometimes impinging upon other civilizations, but also often without opposition. The remaining nomadic bands would recede further from arable land as the settled agricultural peoples expanded, with the last of the nomadic bands either retreating into the mountains and becoming mountain peoples with a distinctive way of life dictated by this distinctive geography, or becoming pastoralists and eventually horse nomads who learned to raid and to conquer the settled peoples through their mastery of mobile fire.Now the entirety of Earth’s surface has been mapped and claimed and there are no frontiers; all territories are claimed by nation-states, or their administration is agreed upon by nation-states (as with the “Empty Quarter” in the Arabian Peninsula or Antarctica). Territorial expansion is now a zero sum game: one nation-state can expand only at the expense of another nation-state. With Earth being entirely divided up among nation-states, civilization is to be found on every inhabited continent, and many of the institutions of civilization are planetary in scale. The Earth itself is the limit, the natural teleology, of civilization. Or, at least, Earth is the natural teleology of planetary civilization.Having converged upon planetary civilization, the planetary idea presents iself: the natural telos of civilization is understood also to be the natural telos of humanity, of political order, of history, of society, of culture, and of civilization. Earth is entirely a civilized planet; the natural order of things is that the planet entire will slowly converge upon a consolidation of all institutions of planetary scale, including political institutions.Needless to say, this unification of natural teleologies into an overarching planetary teleology is strictly speaking a non sequitur; we have no a priori assurance that the events and activities on Earth are “naturally” limited to Earth and find their fulfillment on Earth. Arguably, we have already imagined elaborate futures for civilization beyond Earth, so that even if human civilization fails to make a spacefaring breakout (or, alternatively, to achieve such an inflection point), we can still conceptualize spacefaring civilization, and if spacefaring civilization is not realized in actuality, it becomes an unfulfilled potential — meaning that the fulfillment represented by planetary civilization does not exhaust the meaning of civilization as it has developed to date.The Universalist IdeaSince the Enlightenment, the idea that there should be universally applicable ideas and institutions, equally valid for all peoples at all times and in all places, has gained the upper hand over a de facto particularism, to the point that one must draw attention to this Enlightenment universalism simply to be aware of its presence as a pervasive influence on our conceptions of political order. Universalism has become like the air we breathe, or the water through which fish swim: it is the unquestioned medium that supports and surrounds everything else that we do.Universalism as applied to political thought holds that there is a uniquely optimal political structure through which human beings can best govern themselves. When Francis Fukuyama asserted in his “The End of History?” essay (1989) that this universal political order was none other than liberal democracy, which had won the Cold War contest and proved itself to be the “last man standing” after a global ideological war, this was, in a sense, the culmination of the Enlightenment trajectory toward a new political system that would replace the feudal hierarchies of the past.It could be argued that the Roman idea of a cosmopolitan order was a pre-Enlightenment conception of political universalism; this may well be true, and, while I do not gainsay this interpretation, I see it in the context of larger developments. The backward-looking character of renaissance humanism, that raised the norms and ideals of classical antiquity as a superior model to that of the otherworldly ideals of the Middle Ages, institutionalized the Roman imperium in the western historical imagination, and it could be argued that the Enlightenment seamlessly took up this idealization of classical antiquity and ran with it in order to create its own norm and ideal of Enlightenment universalism. Enlightenment universalism, then, could be understood as the culmination of a long development in western history evolving from a cosmopolitanian Hellenism of late antiquity to the explicit statement and political formulation of an idealized universal form of civilization.A Retrograde IdealThe idea of world government is backward-looking if we understand it as the attempt to recover the Roman achievement, it is backward-looking if we understand it as a tradition of futurist thought (there are comprehensive articles on world government on Wikipedia and the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, both of which discuss the long intellectual pedigree of the idea), and it is backward looking if world government is simply taken as the default position of futurism, the unquestioned political paradigm of futurism, because futurism has always advocated for world government.It would not be at all difficult for anyone who cared to do so, to investigate the possible permutations of political forms that future civilization might take, with an emphasis upon exploring possibilities that have been neglected in the light of the intellectual fixation on world government. That this has not happened in any kind of systematic way is a glaring weakness in futurist thought. The impoverishment of our political futurism is a reflection of an inability or unwillingness to think critically about political institutions, and especially to think critically about the big picture of political institutions in space and time. One must maintain a cultivated blindness to the complex reality of political institutions, and how they have functioned through history, to maintain unquestioned the idea of world government either as a practical outcome of planetary-scale civilization or as an ideal state of human affairs.This is especially true in relationship to the idea of law. Without studying law one tends to view the institution of law as monolithic, but, in fact, law is anything but monolithic. There are many systems of law employed by many different political entities of overlapping jurisdictions. For one small example, a distinction is made between private international law and public international law, with private international law governing interaction of private individuals from different nation-states, and public international law being a agreed-upon framework within which independent nation-states resolve differences. As war takes place within the framework of public international law, nation-states may choose to resolve their differences through armed conflict and still abide by the provisions of public international law.If one conceptualizes world government as a single system of law for everyone, this idea is so out of touch with the reality of law — its tradition, it formulation, its promulgation, its policing, and its enforcement, all of which involve distinct institutions (the legislature, the executive, police, and courts) — it would be difficult to know where to start in pointing out the flaws in this idea.The Code Napoléon represented an attempt to formulate an Enlightenment universal civil code that prevailed throughout much of the Francophone world, but, significantly, the civil code was not truly universal in so far as it did not also serve as a military code, a criminal code, or a commercial code, each of which sectors had codes distinctive to each aspect of life. A comprehensive code can be cobbled together by joining the codes for distinct sectors of society and the economy, but when a legal code is assembled in this way ex post facto, it will inevitably involve conflicts that need to be rationalized. This was the situation with Roman law when Justinian commissioned the Corpus Iuris Civilis, which was a compendium and synthesis of Roman law that aimed to rationalize hundreds of years of Roman law into a single system of law.The Corpus Iuris Civilis was formulated in Byzantium when Roman civilization had already largely failed in western civilization, so that as European civilization took shape in the aftermath of Roman collapse, it eventually came to draw upon the Corpus Iuris Civilis (which haunted the western historical imagination in law as in other areas of life), but it also drew from the traditions of law among the German tribes (the “barbarians”), as well as eventually from the English common law tradition, which represents the other focal point of legal thought in the western tradition, which is bookended by Roman statutory law and English common law, which latter is a body of case law.This brief sketch of the prolixity of legal traditions within the context of a single civilization could easily be multiplied. Most civilizations have a multiplicity of legal traditions superimposed upon each other over a long history, so that there are many legal codes that can claim to be traditional, and none that can claim to be universal. This is true for all the institutions of civilization, in each and every tradition of civilization; pluralism is the reality that cannot be wished away. Rather than engage in shadowboxing between the reality of a plurality of legal traditions and the monolithic shade of a pretense to universal legal traditions, we should embrace the reality of pluralism and learn to live with it, both at the level of local institutions and at the level of planetary institutions.Taking Politics Seriously in a Planetary ContextI have earlier pointed out that one of the great disconnects in western thought is that between philosophy of law and political philosophy. One would suppose that law is the implementation of politics, and politics the sum total of law, so that these bodies of thought would be related as idea to execution, but in fact we find problems in the philosophy of law being discussed in a conceptual framework that only partially overlaps with political philosophy, and vice versa, so that there is no systematic approach to identifying problems common to both, much less resolving these problems. The philosophy of law in Anglo-American analytical philosophy has become tightly focused on legal positivism, while political philosophy remains mired in the presuppositions implied above that follow from unquestioned Enlightenment universalism.We need to move beyond both the retrograde ideal of planetary governance and the disconnection between legal and political institutions. Taking politics seriously in a planetary context would mean a planetary revaluation of all values (what Nietzsche called Umwertung aller Werte), which in turn would mean a planetary revaluation of law and legal institutions, of politics and political institutions, and overcoming the disconnect between the two. Those who look toward planetary governance as an ideal for humanity have an intellectual responsibility not merely to invoke an empty concept of world governance, but to conduct just such a thorough-going revaluation of legal, political, and civilizational institutions, so that they can offer concrete proposals that transcend the past rather than recreating past follies on a larger scale.This is not something that could be accomplished by one comprehensive book, or by a few books. This would require a multi-generational research project that would benefit from the contribution of the best minds of all the world’s civilizations, spontaneously and willingly cooperating in the enterprise because the idea of planetary ideals and values becomes so compelling that one cannot but dedicate oneself to it. Until such time as such a multi-generational research project comes into being and begins to bear fruit, one should not make the mistake of taking the idea of world governance seriously, as in its current state it is merely the province of dilettantes, who have little of substance on offer. Until then, we are better off investing our time in studying permutations of the nation-state and how it is expressed in the anarchic international state system, since there is at least an extant body of scholarship undergirding this context for planetary affairs.Konstantin Yuon, “New Planet” (1921)CuriousFind out what others have already figured out.

Is beauty really subjective?,https://medium.com/@abhishekyadav8105/the-philosophy-of-beauty-6d516a4e104?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"Philosophy,Philosopher,Beauty,Political,Political Science","Image by: morhamedufmgIs a red rose as beautiful to you as it is to me? Is a messy room beautiful to you? Do you find a hillside sunrise attractive? How do we predispose ourselves to embrace whether “beauty” is universal?From the ancient Greek philosophers like Plato and Aristotle to Shaftesbury, Hume, and Kant, almost all the philosophers have engaged with the questions above. While the meaning of “beauty” has been contended on various premises like aesthetics vs. ethics, love and longing, classical vs. idealist conceptions, I will primarily focus on the objectivity vs. subjectivity of beauty and how different philosophers, through their works, have made a stance in the literary debate.One of the most common narratives or the theory of beauty is whether beauty is subjective- located “in the eye of the beholder.” On the other hand, the objectivity of love, too, is not unheard of or unread of in the philosophical history. In fact, most ancient and medieval accounts, for the most part, located beauty outside of anyone’s particular experiences. However, the subjective narrative of beauty has been commonplace since the time of sophists. By the eighteenth century, Hume could write in his accounts:Beauty is no quality in things themselves: It exists merely in the mind which contemplates them; and each mind perceives a different beauty. One person may even perceive deformity, where another is sensible of beauty; and every individual ought to acquiesce in his own sentiment, without pretending to regulate those of others. (Hume 1757, 136)However, if we base the entire meaning of beauty on the subjective consciousness, the word itself loses all the importance, for we are not communicating anything when we call something beautiful except perhaps a positive personal attitude. Furthermore, although our judgments of things differ, isn’t it incredible how our appraisals coincide with appreciating the beauty of a perfect red rose, or a dramatic sunrise/sunset on a hillside? Any deviation in appreciating the beauty in these cases would often look perverse. Do we find the sunrise/sunset beautiful because they are truly beautiful or because the people around us have collectively and conventionally defined them as beautiful? Such sights do give us some pleasure. However, do we find pleasure in them because they are beautiful, or are they beautiful because we find pleasure in them? Augustine asks explicitly in De Veritate Religione: Are things beautiful because they give delight, or whether they give delight because they are beautiful? He emphatically chooses the second (Augustine, 247). Augustine’s objective explanation of beauty is complemented by the works of Plato and Plotinus in the Symposium and Enneads, respectively. They associate beauty to a response of love and desire but locate beauty itself in the realm of the Forms. Both of them in their works have clearly defined different forms that a “beautiful” object can take.Photo by: M PAlthough Plato and Aristotle disagree in other facets of beauty, they both regard the objectivity of beauty in the sense that it is not localized in the beholder’s response. The classic conception treats beauty as a matter of instantiating definite proportions among parts, sometimes expressed in mathematical ratios, like the “golden section.” One of such illustrations is in the work of Polykleitos. He adopted a specific proportion while sculpting ‘The Canon.’ In ancient philosophy, it is considered that one has to adopt the objective proportion to reproduce any beautiful price of art. Yet, the old convention does attribute some of the normative of beauty to the pleasurable experiences. For instance, Plotinus has:“This is the spirit that Beauty must ever induce: wonderment and a delicious trouble, longing, and love and a trembling that is all delight” (Plotinus 23, [Ennead 1, 3]).While the classic philosophers directed the pleasurable experience as an inadvertent outcome of beauty, the eighteenth-century philosophers regarded pleasure as not an effect but the origin of beauty. This diversion somewhat fueled the subjective narrative of beauty. Locke and other likeminded empiricists treated color (which is an essential locus of beauty), as a ‘phantasm’ of the mind, as a set of qualities dependent on a subjective response, located in the perceiving mind rather than of the world outside the mind. Without the perceivers, in this case, the beauty of an object would diminish in value. This was significantly substantiated by the argument that the beauty of a hillside sunrise/sunset is of no value for a blind person. Even the beauty of a specific object can change when viewed in the daytime or at night. Such variations are conspicuous in experiences of beauty as well.While the ancient and medieval works of literature often tend to make polarized arguments while defining beauty, the relatively modern literature often opt for a marriage of both the art and the philosophy of beauty. They appreciate both the objectivity and the subjectivity of it. For instance, G.E. Moore writes:“To say that a thing is beautiful is to say, not indeed that it is itself good, but that it is a necessary element in something which is: to prove that a thing is truly beautiful is to prove that a whole, to which it bears a particular relation as a part, is truly good” (Moore 1903, 201).Moore tries to explain the importance of the situation in which the object and the person experiencing are both ingrained. In line with the similar thought, Crispin Startwell, in his book Six Names of Beauty (2004), attributes beauty neither exclusively to the object nor the observer. He argues the beauty that we assign to the night sky is not solely because of the pleasure we derive from it. The presence of the night sky itself is pivotal in the creation of beauty. On the contrary, beauty would lose all its value in the absence of the perceiver. Hence, beauty is not merely created in the eyes of the beholder, nor is it inherently a characteristic of the object; the beauty is created through the juxtaposition and connection of the perceiver and the object.Please let me know your thoughts and feedback through comments!

"Sir, Have you ever even considered burning shit down?",https://medium.com/@j.collins/sir-have-you-ever-even-considered-burning-shit-down-a8133a5bd55?source=tag_archive---------4-----------------------,"Fire Monkey,Political Science,Politics,Anarchism,Society","Our Exclusive interview with the esteemed Fyre Monkey on the right of dissent“Fire Monke” (image owned by Joshua Collins)I sat down with my good friend and mentor Fire Monkey (also spelled Fyre Monke) over plantains and kool aid here in Colombia to get his opinion on current events in the world. Our conversation is reprinted below, edited only for clarity and space.JC: Hello, Fire Monkey. Thanks for agreeing to chat. Why don’t you explain a little bit about what you do.FM: Fyre MonkeJC: Excuse me?FM: It’s pronounced Fyre Monke.JC: That’s what I said.FM: No you said “Fire Monkey”, which is an allusion to a cousin of mine from Chinese mythology, more commonly known as “The Monkey King” aka Sun Wukong aka Son Goku. That’s cultural appropriation, and if you do it again I’m leaving the interview.JC: Umm…deepest apologies. Well, Fyre Monke, can you explain a little bit about what you do?FM: No problem, Joshua. Some of your readers may already be familiar with me, but to any newcomers who might be suffering under the poor fortune of not having been blessed with the knowledge of my grandeur, allow me to introduce myself. It is I, the illustrious Fyre Monke, destroyer of worlds, patron saint of lost causes, the chaos-bringer, lover of anarchy and justice, ardent supporter of those who struggle in the streets against tyranny. Also ardent supporter of those who struggle in the street against inconvenience. Alright, ardent supporter of people struggling in the streets for just about anything as long they’re not assholes or fascists. Well, sometimes assholes too, but that depends highly on context. Here, take my card.JC: Wow, you really wrote all that on a card…is that a picture of the Monkey King Sun Wukong on the back? I thought….FM: Look, let’s not get caught up in details. I believe you had some questions about policy and social issues?JC: Right, yes, let’s get to it. 2019 was a year of record civil unrest, and 2020 is following in that path. Some experts…FM: YES! IT’S BEAUTIFUL!JC: Err…did you just shoot flames out of your eyes?FM: Of course not, Please continue.JC: Some experts predict that 2021 will be even more fraught with social uprisings as the impacts of COVID-19 become more apparent and nations lift preventative lockdown measures. What do you think can be done to help prevent widespread unrest?FM: I’m sorry I don’t understand the question.JC: …FM:…JC:…FM: These roasted plantains are quite good. Thank you for inviting me here today.JC: Right. Next question. A global rise in populism and widespread growth of both conspiracy theories and disinformation networks have been an important topic of conversation in culture and media lately. Do you see this as a widespread problem preventing the encouragement and development of democracy in global society?FM: No.JC: I’m sorry, can you elaborate? Why not?FM: Look, information, dis-information, what’s the difference really when we get down to the bottom of the issue? I’m not concerned about “facts” and all this ‘blah blah blah’ you windbag journalists are always going on about. Democracy is simple, you smash the tyrannical hierarchy and then you let people live their lives. The details will sort themselves out.JC: Ah ok, so you would consider yourself a minarchist then?FM: Hell no. Labels and teams are for only suckers and windbags like you. I focus on the important bit, liberation and the creation of truly free peoples. Does this cafe serve tea?JC: Just herbal tea.FM: Perfect, i don’t believe in the existence of proper tea anyway. It’s a construct of an unjust society. Mind if I order a cup? You said you’re picking up the tab, no? I don’t carry money. I find it to be annoying.JC: Yes, of course, please. What would you say to people who posit that as these global social movements emerge and create connections and communications networks between one-another, forming what some refer and transnational solidarity, it becomes harder for States to to discredit them or lie about conditions on the ground?FM: Look, computers seem neat. They make cool glowy images and I quite like pornography, but technology is just silly toys humans made to feel better about themselves if you take a step back and really look at it. I mean, don’t get me wrong, there are some exceptions- fireworks for example, I like fireworks. And really really fast spaceships seem pretty neat. It would be cool to burn shit down on Mars. I would like to do that someday.What’s important here is smashing the tyrannical hierarchy. It’s like the people who are always telling me to read Peter Alex CroBumpkin..JC: I’m sorry do you mean Pyotr Alexeyevich Kropotkin?FM: That’s what I said, yes. anyway. All this “theory” is just rules, man. I dislike rules. I get to like page two and I want to reply, Sir, have you even considered burning shit down? I consider myself a monkey of action. You humans talk too much. More flame, less lame, that’s what I always say.JC: Fair enough. Final question: do you think it’s possible to solve the problem of scarcity inherent in market-based economies, or do you think that a better solution would be to try and build a society more focused on people than capital, and a follow-up. Do you think that hierarchies will still naturally emerge even in a stateless society?FM: OH MY GOD YOU’RE SO BORING! This is why you don’t have a girlfriend. Look, Joshua. Burn shit down. Just burn shit down. It’s simple. Freedom. Action. Anyway thanks for the chat, I have to get going though. I have a tindr date with a cute “mona” here in Bogota this evening.Luck with your boring ‘blah blah blah’ article. Chao!Joshua Collins is a freelance journalist and photographer based in Colombia.

Do Leftists Want Joe Biden to Lose?,https://medium.com/discourse/do-leftists-want-joe-biden-to-lose-756bf33f15e6?source=tag_archive---------5-----------------------,"Politics,Government,History,Political Science,2020 Presidential Race","Kyle Kylanski is arguably the most influential leftist with millions of followers between Twitter and YouTube.When it comes to current events, many leftist arguments originate with him. One of Kyle Kylanski’s central arguments is that he will not vote for Joe Biden because Joe Biden doesn’t support at least one-of-his-top-five-positions: “Medicare for All, free college, living wage, ending the wars, and UBI.” If Joe Biden supported one of those positions then Kyle Kylanski said he’d vote for him in 2020.Kyle Kylanski’s view is that he doesn’t want to keep rewarding the Democratic party with his vote because it signals to the party that they can continue to ignore leftist demands while taking leftist support for granted.But what is better? If Joe Biden gave 10%, 10%, 10%, 10%, 100% on each of those positions, or if he gave 50%, 50%, 50%, 50%, 50%?With the latter, leftists are getting more of their agenda through even though Joe Biden fails their ideological purity test on each issue.The truth is that Joe Biden is overall the most leftist Democratic nominee in American history with a running mate who has a Senate voting record further left than Bernie Sanders therefore many centrist Democrats believe they have moved far enough left to satisfy the leftist wing of the party.After all, some of the things Biden/Harris are running on are a $15 minimum wage, free public college for families making under $125,000, a universal housing voucher program, a public option, a $2 trillion dollar green energy plan, a $775 billion plan for caregiving, and a $700 billion “made in America” plan. Biden’s plans come to at least $10 trillion, which is three times the cost of what Hillary Clinton proposed in 2016.“You know what, Joe Biden will become the most progressive president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt. And that, in this moment, is what we need.” — Bernie SandersBut a lot of leftists who are persuaded by that platform still won’t vote for Joe Biden, somewhat paradoxically to Kyle Kylanski’s desire, because they feel he compromises too much!It’s not good enough he holds those positions today he should have held them 10 years ago! This is why even if Joe Biden did support Medicare-for-All there are still many on the left who wouldn’t vote for him because they don’t think he’d actually fight for it. I think this is a fair critique given that in Joe Biden’s previous presidential runs and throughout his long Senatorial career he was known more of as a centrist bipartisan backslapper by supporting such policies as a federal spending freeze and a balanced budget amendment.Ultimately, many leftists believe time is on their side.If Joe Biden wins in 2020 he’ll either seek reelection or have VP Kamala Harris take the ball from there, which could arguably stall the leftist agenda, but if Joe Biden loses then not only will it be easier for democratic socialists to get the nomination in 2024, but it’ll also be easier for them to win the presidency as it is the political norm for the country to change parties in the White House after 8 years.And not only that, but after 8 years of Trump and a more diverse electorate, leftists could be set for a landslide victory in 2024 and be able to push much more of their agenda through in a way that could be difficult with a non-democratic-socialist in the White House and a more evenly divided Senate.From a leftist perspective wouldn’t it, therefore, be better to wait until 2024 instead of Joe Biden making marginal gains now? During radical times, moderate success can be a liability. If Joe Biden wins, Republicans will be in a better position in 2024 to run the “change” candidate, i.e. somebody whose younger, more charismatic, more ideologically-pure, more ethnic, and more anti-establishment, such as the increasingly popular 2016 Republican runner-up Ted Cruz who currently has the #1 podcast in the country.Of course, it’s a big gamble to bet on 2024 (even for disillusioned conservatives in the reverse case) because if 2016 has taught us anything it’s that a lot can happen from now till then.And so although many leftists are not actively cheerleading for Trump to win in order to create their dream 2024 scenario because there are so many ways that Machevillian strategy could backfire it’s enough of a hope for many leftists to keep their pom poms at home.Dialogue & DiscourseNews and ideas worthy of discourse.Follow194 6 PoliticsGovernmentHistoryPolitical Science2020 Presidential Race194 claps194 claps6 responsesWritten byAnthony GalliFollowsocio-political polemic and essayist | www.AnthonyGalli.comFollowDialogue & DiscourseFollowNews and ideas worthy of discourse.

"<strong class=""bz"">MY FIRST NYC VOTER REGISTRATION CASE</strong>",https://medium.com/3streams/my-first-nyc-voter-registration-case-21c142ef938e?source=tag_archive---------6-----------------------,"Voting Rights,Voter Suppression Laws,New York Election,Political Science,Elections","By: KEN SHERRILLToday is National Voter Registration Day.Photo by Elliott Stallion on UnsplashThis reminds me of my first experience as an expert witness at a trial. In the spring of 1969 — my second year at Hunter College in New York City — my colleague Blanche Blank came up to me in the hallway outside the department office and asked me if I did the kind of statistical analysis that could be useful in a voter registration case. I replied that Profs. Don Matthews and Jim Prothro, my University of North Carolina dissertation advisors, had testified in many voter registration cases, usually about barriers to Black registration in the South, and that I thought that I could do the same sort of work. After all, I thought that was something that political scientists routinely did.Blanche told me that a friend of hers, Burt Neuborne of the ACLU National, was working on a case about New York’s bizarre voter registration laws and that he needed someone like me as an expert witness. I was excited by the idea of doing it. I thought it was another rite of passage into being a real political scientist, a part of growing up as a professional.New York’s system at the time was truly bizarre.Anyone who met the age, residency, and literacy test requirements could go to their county Board of Elections — one in each borough in a city of 8,000,000 people — and register to vote until about Labor Day. After that, voter registration took place at local polling places, but only for three days in early October. After that, it was impossible to register to vote. Surely, that system had the effect of depressing the vote, of denying many citizens of their right to vote. I was really excited about having the chance to tear that stupid barrier down.The plan was very simple.All I needed to do was to get each state’s deadline for voter registration and each state’s turnout rate. Then I analyzed the turnout rate in comparison with the number of days between the close of registration and Election Day. That allowed me to estimate the percent of additional voters that came with each additional day of registration. (This was quite a learning experience for me. I had no idea that some states had same-day registration.) Anyway, I computed the percent of voting age citizens who would be added to the rolls if there were no September shutdown and the percent of additional citizens who would be enfranchised if we were to extend voter registration by a week or two.The results were quite substantial.Other than asserting that the state had the power to set the deadlines whenever it wanted, New York’s only defense was that the Board of Elections needed the downtime in order to process the registration forms. Ultimately, the state’s only defense was bureaucratic incompetence. Fortunately, the ACLU had an ace up its sleeve. David Dinkins, who would go on to become Mayor, chaired the New York City Board of Elections and he eloquently testified that the Board would have no difficulty processing the additional registration forms. The judge ruled in our favor and thousands more New Yorkers were registered to vote.Doing this testimony turned out to be much more than a professional rite of passage. Most political scientists never have the experience of using their professional skills to do some real good for the public at large. The thrill that comes from doing this is immeasurable. I went on to do another voter registration case in New York with Burt Neuborne and David Dinkins and I became friends. I went on to work with the ACLU and Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund on LGBTQ rights cases culminating with a Supreme Court victory in Romer v. Evans. Those cases will be the subject of later postings.Addendum on a 1970 failureThe next year, Blanche, Burt, and I were back in federal court to attack another crazy aspect of New York’s election law. At the time, enrolled voters were allowed to cast absentee ballots in the general election but not in nominating primaries.Our plaintiff was a soldier on duty in Vietnam who wanted to vote for Al Lowenstein, who was running for the Democratic congressional nomination as an anti-war candidate against a machine-backed incumbent who was a supporter of the war. I was prepared to testify about why enrolled members of a political party’s right to vote in party primaries were entitled to the same protections as enrolled voters in general elections.The judge may or may not have had any connections to the Brooklyn machine, but he threw the case out and I wasn’t allowed to testify. I haven’t been able to take a “win some/lose some” approach to people being denied their fundamental rights. I think that the issue was resolved by legislative action in later years. If that soldier survived the war, still lived in New York, and still was an enrolled Democrat, he’d be able to vote absentee in Democratic primaries fifty years later.3StreamsA blog about politics, policy, and ideasFollow5 Voting RightsVoter Suppression LawsNew York ElectionPolitical ScienceElections5 claps5 clapsWritten byKenneth SherrillFollowProfessor Emeritus of political science at Hunter College, CUNY and Graduate School, CUNY.

Science,International Relations,Power","在上一篇文中我們稍微透過三個陷阱定律來暸解中國目前的處境和地位，如果還沒有看過的可以點選連結：兩大強權的角力下，臺灣該怎麼做？（上）來觀看。本篇文會聚焦在中美的關係以及臺灣可行的做法來進行探討。Photo by Vladislav Klapin on Unsplash前言近期逢迪士尼電影〈花木蘭〉在臺灣各大電影院上映，其中女主角劉亦菲挺港警的言論頗受爭議，引起社會上紛紛出現抵制觀看〈花木蘭〉的聲音，要與港人站在同一陣線，拒絕中國的大外宣；另外在該片結尾致謝中也出現「中國共產黨新疆維吾爾自治委員會宣傳部門」此極具爭議性的組織，該組織曾被指控對維吾爾族進行強迫勞動和絕育等恐造成族群滅絕和文化消失的手段，更興起了大眾對於中國大外宣的注意和反感，但諷刺的是，目前〈花木蘭〉在台灣的票房已達約3800萬元，票房排名高居世界第二，說明了諸如此類的抵制、拒看等消極性的被動手段，無法有效的阻擋中國的大外宣政策。更不用說年初的總統大選所受到各種網路滲透、攻擊等威脅國家安全的案件層出不窮，以及時常聽到個資洩漏的資安問題，這些有關「資訊」的議題也許是我們現在都應該要有所警覺和提防的，以下我們會進行討論。中美戰爭？直接戰爭？超限戰？Photo by Kevin Ku on Unsplah首先，我想先來探討「資訊」所帶來的影響與威脅。根據中國軍旅作家喬良和人民解放軍空軍大校王湘穗所著的《超限戰》一書，未來的戰爭模式很有可能導向超限戰的局勢。超限戰即意味著超越傳統範圍手段的新型戰爭形式，包括資訊戰、貿易戰、新恐怖主義、科技戰以及生態戰。超限戰是可以透過不流血手段來達到傳統戰爭可以達到的效果，強調「軍事技術」、「科技發展」在未來戰爭的地位是不可取代的。除此之外，喬良也指出「戰爭泛化」是必然的：網路戰、資源戰、媒體戰、金融戰、文化戰等領域都是未來的重點戰場，戰爭範圍已經遠遠超出傳統軍人的能力範疇。這本書不僅精準預測美國九一一攻擊事件的發生，在恐攻發生後掀起一波討論的浪潮，也證實了現在臺灣和美國正面臨到的問題：媒體戰與資訊戰的攻防早就開始。我們把時間拉回到2016年的11月8號，當天正舉辦美國第58屆的總統選舉，並且由共和黨的川普和其搭檔彭斯以306張選舉人票贏過希拉蕊和凱恩的232票，成為美國總統。這樣的結果令美國主流媒體一時之間難以置信，堂堂美國總統竟然是由非典型政治人物出身的川普當選，怎麼會這樣呢？我們再把時間拉到2018年的11月24號，這天是臺灣第7次的直轄市長和縣市長選舉，由國民黨所派出的候選人韓國瑜以89萬票贏下長年綠色執政的高雄市，終結民進黨在高雄20年的連續執政。同樣的非典型政治人物，同樣的贏得了一場出人意表的選戰，也許你會覺得可能就是人民覺得日子過得太苦了，想要換一個做做看；或是這些候選人的口才好，把未來美好願景講得極具吸引力；又或是他們的政策真的略勝其他候選人一籌，但我個人認為，比起上述的幾個理由，這些選戰結果跟選民所接收到的「資訊」有著更深層的連結。為什麼這麼說呢？一個很顯而易見的理由就是：你會每天關注候選人的政見發表或是造勢場合說過的話嗎？當然一定會有些許政治效能感極高的人定期暸解這些候選人的消息，但很明顯的是這種人在社會上並不佔多數，人民更傾向於每天瀏覽社群軟體：臉書、推特、Instagram和各種網路新聞平台，從自己既有的舒適圈和朋友圈中獲取相關消息，需要注意的是，這容易產生在社會心理學上所謂「團體激化」以及「團體迷思」的問題發生，前者意謂著團體討論傾向強化最強勢的意見，使得最後的決定比原本的決定更為偏頗；後者則說明團體內過度在意共識，犧牲了批判思考的精神，這會導致人們對於接收資訊的光譜將越來越窄，越來越難以得到不同觀點的看法，尤其是演算法進步神速，逐漸能夠區分出更細微的團體差異，並投遞更加精確的廣告，讓人們去相信他們所看到的狹小框架內就是社會上的主流趨勢，引發「同溫層效應」。所以真正讓人們去認識和認同某一候選人，我認為多半是靠著社群網絡的媒介來獲取的，這也使得資訊的地位在近年來逐漸提升，並成為各國在軍事上的主要佈局議題。再者，我想針對中美直接戰爭的可能性來進行探討。我認為中美在未來不會有直接且全面性的軍事衝突，其原因可以分為以下四點：第一，地理位置來看，美中為處於太平洋的兩端，兩國在領土、海洋上沒有衝突因子，發生軍事衝突的機率較低，在這邊我們只單純討論國土的問題，不考慮代理人戰爭的情況，兩國在邊界上沒有交集的地區，較不容易產生近期在中印邊界拉達克主權爭議區的「班公錯」（Pangong Tso）南側高地的衝突情況，；第二，由自然資源觀點來看，兩國均屬擁有相當豐富的天然資源蘊藏量，因此兩國較不易因為資源匱乏而產生衝突，川普也在競選期間不段強調美國將會致力於開發頁岩油田，確保國家石油穩定提供；第三，根據金德爾伯格（Charles P．Kindleberger）的霸權穩定論一說，霸權的運作必須建立在提供霸權公共財之上，包含提供開放市場、長期借貸、維持匯率穩定以及確保世界總體經濟政策協調，若無法維持這些共同利益，則此霸權將衰弱而被另一興起的霸權取代之。根據〈2049百年馬拉松：中國稱霸全球的祕密戰略〉一書中可以得知中國顯然有心於成為繼美國之後的另一霸權，但由人民幣在世界的流通率仍遠低於美國可見，中國目前要能夠持續提供霸權公共財的能力還有待商榷。因此在整體經濟實力超越美國時，中國取代美國霸權的地位才較有勝算，但目前看來原本就已經脆弱的中國經濟體加上新冠肺炎疫情的肆虐，此一前景在短期之內應該無法看見；第四，各國的武器科技越發先進、致命，在中美皆有核彈頭的處境下，承襲了冷戰以來相互毀滅保證的嚇阻效果，避免雙方在軍事上的輕舉妄動。綜合上述四個理由，我認為在中美爆發直接戰爭的可能性在近期內還是偏低的。然而這並不代表中美兩大世界強權就不會有所較勁，自2018年起的中美貿易戰就可以很明顯地看到兩國在經濟上的斡旋與交火，一直到近期世界衛生組織在疫情處理的失職引起川普不滿並宣布將停止世衛組織的金援，中國旋即跳出來表示將承接資金的援助，同樣也能看到兩國在國際組織地位上的爭奪戰。我們再將鏡頭拉到這兩個月來臺海的緊張情勢，共軍9月10號在西南海域舉行聯合軍演，並遭到臺灣軍方指控其軍機多次跨越西南防空識別區的界線，具有挑性意味且威脅臺灣安全；而美國艦隊在南海也集結了強大軍力，在今年6月也進行羅斯福號(USS Theodore Roosevelt CVN-71)及尼米茲號(USS Nimitz CVN-68)雙航母的軍事演習，向中國傳達其在臺海附近的強大實力，具有威懾意義。由此可見臺海或將成為新的代理人戰場也說不定，這是我們在今明兩年需要非常注意的地方。綜合上述，我認為中國與美國的全面性戰爭的機會較低，兩國的主戰場將會轉往超限戰的範疇邁進，尤其是以資訊戰的形式展開機會較大；又或是進行在第三地作戰的代理人戰爭，避免本國國土的直接傷亡。但無可否認的是，中國做為一新興的霸權挑戰者，它對於現今霸權－美國的權力抗衡，在未來仍有許多斡旋和衝突的空間與可能性；又或是中國內部掉入塔西佗陷阱，進而引發轉移注意力戰爭，種種的情況也值得我們更深入的思考。臺灣的因應方式？討論完了中國內部情況以及中美關係後，我們將探討臺灣在具體的因應方式上有什麼做法。臺灣自國民政府遷台以來，一直處於中國和美國兩大強權的關注焦點，現今國內兩大黨也各自被視為兩國在臺灣的代理人：民進黨親美；國民黨親中，而臺灣的民意也粗略可以分為這兩派。在本節我將以三個面向討論臺灣在未來可以因應的方式：分別為「中美貿易戰下的戰略調整」、「資訊戰的防禦」以及「外交型態的改變」。（一）中美貿易戰下的戰略調整2019年底，聯合國在11月5日公布一研究報告，提到了中美貿易戰下臺灣是最大受益者，因為美國從中國減少進口的350億美元的產品，其中210億被臺灣、墨西哥、歐盟等國家的出口所替代，可以看出台灣的產業在國際具有極高的競爭力，尤以7月時英特爾宣布採取其他廠商的晶圓消息一出，台積電的股價隨即亮燈漲停，說明臺積電在世界晶圓製造與研發的地位向上攀升，但在中美貿易戰情勢尚未明朗之時，加上新冠肺炎疫情重挫世界經濟，引起全球經濟的不確定性，臺灣可以有以下幾點的策略參考：第一，政府應該更加留意新台幣匯率的穩定，讓臺灣中小型企業能夠有效降低出口的匯率損失風險，畢竟臺灣仍是屬於中小型企業較多的國家；第二，政府應該協助業者強化以臺灣為核心的全球佈局，提供臺商回流的獎勵機制，穩固臺灣在科技產業的地位；第三，政府應結合新南向政策，鼓勵業者增加與東南亞市場的連結和合作，經營東亞產業鍊；第四，政府可提供優良的國內投資環境和法令規範，吸引海外臺商和外國產業對臺投資。（二）資訊戰的防禦資訊戰屬於混合戰（Hybrid war）的一環，其特色在於難以被歸責或追究，行動者傾向採取難以取證，或是刻意混淆的手法，目的是為了被追究時方便否認，具有「易否性」（Plausible Deniability）。從俄羅斯運用混合戰攻下克里米亞，以及俄羅斯介入美國大選，分裂美國社會等事件看出資訊戰的威力甚於以往的常規戰。中國也同樣運用其大外宣政策，利用武器化的公關戰攻擊臺灣今年年初的總統選舉，許多中國公司會利用社交網站和收購的媒體，即所謂的內容農場，進行一次又一次的炒作與散播，逐步改變群眾的看法，甚至有新聞媒體高調宣傳和平統一。臺灣正處在中國資訊戰的最前線，我國應正視資訊戰的問題，更積極地採取防禦措施和反攻之道，以下三點策略可供參考：一、詳盡研究資訊的流通，建立數位鑑識系統，釐清對方攻擊的策略和戰術；二、強化民眾資安意識，加強相關法規，保護個人隱私資料不被竊取；三、強化人民的媒體識讀能力，深化民主人權思維，養成思辨與查證的能力，這是最為長遠的目標，但卻也是最重要的，因為中國資訊戰並不會停止，我們必須要學會分辨真假消息的能力，才不會被風向帶著走。（三）外交型態的改變適逢新冠肺炎疫情的衝擊，讓臺灣完善的醫療體系以及優秀的防疫成績被世界所關注，許多國家紛紛效仿臺灣在抗疫上的作法，我國也順勢推行口罩外交，並分享防疫經驗，與世界各國合作促進全人類的健康安全。除了在抗疫上臺灣受到國際媒體關注，使得加入世界衛生組織的議題有英、美、德、法、日等國支持，重新進入國際組織的目標變得較為明朗時，我們仍應該放眼未來，積極建立國與國之間的關係，強化國家安全。目前的可行方法有二：一為「數位外交」，透過社群媒體的倡議活動，替臺灣和不同國家的人民搭起友誼的橋樑，屬於公民外交的一種；第二，巧外交（Smart Diplomacy），跳脫傳統外交「國與國」的思維，以更包容性的國際合作發展思維，整合外交、教育、科技、經貿、醫療與人權等各部會資源，以及結合官方與民間資源，針對不同開發中國家需求，量身打造跨部門合作的國際發展策略，才能使臺灣擺脫外交困境，創造以人為本的自由民主價值，成為全人類發展過程的重要角色。總結最近國際事件頻傳，很多與臺灣息息相關的事件我們都應該多加關注，然而我認為臺灣目前的主流媒體對於國際世界的著墨並不多，國人不容易接收到相關資訊，在社會上的討論度也不高，這是相當危險也相當可惜的事，身為長期與中美雙方保持高度的經濟合作，並面對中國武力威脅的第一線國家，如何認知到臺灣在國際的地位並保護自己是很重要的，我們並不如以色列具有非常強烈的民族意識和對美影響力，這也使得如何發揮臺灣的長處贏得國際認同顯得更為重要，這也是我在寫文章搜集資料時希望可以去暸解的，強迫自己透過國際事件來認識臺灣，如果我們自己都不願意認識自己生長的土地，不願意去認同我們的國家，那你還期望誰會來認同呢？總結來說，我認為認知到臺灣在國際的地位和長處，並與國際接軌，是我們必須要做的事，不應該一直處於被動的地位，被其他國家牽著鼻子走，不論是親中或是親美都一定各有優劣，完全認知自己的國家才能有一個較為宏觀的判斷；才不會因為兩黨的執政輪替導致對外政策不斷改變、移轉；才能有一個能夠走得長遠的路，也因為這樣才有機會找到我們真正的定位。如果有任何問題或是不完善的地方也請讀到這裡的大家不吝給予指教，希望未來在寫作上可以持續的進步！參考文獻臺灣國際合作發展概念書－台灣海外援助發展聯盟倡議（林子倫，2016）霸權穩定論與歐巴馬政府的亞太戰略發展（賴榮偉，2013）臺灣面臨新型態資訊戰，不僅是「網軍」那麼簡單（林雨蒼，2019）資訊戰，然後呢？《台灣產業因應之道》美中貿易戰對台灣產業的影響與機會《操弄：劍橋分析事件大揭祕》：身為歐巴馬鐵粉，我卻掌握了川普新帝國的鑰匙「劍橋分析」事件是什麼？一文搞懂免費心理測驗背後的故事班公錯肉搏戰：印中邊境二度衝突，印度軍「藏族流亡戰士」陣亡Written

We know Trump is racist. But can we empirically prove it?,https://medium.com/@batadaisy/we-know-trump-is-racist-but-can-we-empirically-prove-it-8d92992cabf0?source=tag_archive---------8-----------------------,"Trump,Racism,Twitter,Political Science,Discourse Analysis","Trump’s Racist Twitter: A discourse analysis of the construction of the ‘dangerous’ immigrant and Trump as America’s saviour“In moments of crisis, people are willing to hand over great deals of power to anyone who claims to have a magic cure.” — Naomi Klein, The Shock DoctrineThe North American relationship with immigration has never been an easy one. Founded by immigrants and built by slaves, public discourse on immigration has always lent itself to a more conservative angle. There has always been a steady stream of migration in and out of the U.S., from all over the world, but from the 1960s onwards that number has been enlarging, with what is sometimes referred to as increased ‘browning’ of society, referring to more migration from Asia, Africa and the Middle East, in contrast to the White of European-Christian cultural heritage majority of the country. In the 2016 election, immigration had somehow taken a large role in Republican nominee’s campaigns. Whether through blatant xenophobic language (“they’re rapists”, Presidential Announcement speech June 16th, 2015) or veiled metaphorical constructions (“some, I assume, are good people”, ibid.), the successful Republican nominee Donald J. Trump put anti-immigration rhetoric, and his ‘Border Wall’, centre stage.Trump’s Border Wall was first mentioned in his Presidential announcement speech as a way to stop what he posited as immigrants “flooding” into the country on the southern border between the U.S. and Mexico. And when he was elected President, many of his most controversial policies were related to immigration. The administration, for example, has been criticised for Executive Order 13769, titled Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States, commonly dubbed as the ‘Muslim Ban’, in which countries of majority Muslim populations were temporarily banned from entering the U.S. Family separations on the border have been widely criticised, as have Trump supporters, who chanted “send her back” (July 17th, 2019, Greenville, North Carolina) in response to Trump’s ongoing conflict with Ilhan Omar, the first Muslim-identifying congresswoman of Minnesota’s fifth district.In his Presidential Announcement speech on June 16th, 2015, Trump conflated immigration with criminality, saying that “when Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best […] They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. […] It’s coming from more than Mexico. It’s coming from all over South and Latin America, and it’s coming probably — probably — from the Middle East.” And from that day on has persisted with a narrative that immigration (specifically from “shithole countries” (Dawsey, 2018)) poses an immediate danger to the lives and livelihoods of Americans.Populism, a shift in the Overton Window, a rise in the ‘alt-right’ or a reaction to the Obama Presidency are all spurious elements in the relationship between the Trump administration and anti-immigrant policies. Trump, like other Presidents before him, has stoked uncertainty, fear and anxiety around immigration through his rhetoric. This research analyses how Trump uses anti-immigrant discourse on Trump’s Twitter feed, @realDonaldTrump, to answer the question of why he might do so. It looks at instances of inflammatory language with words such as ‘aliens’, ‘anchor babies’ and ‘illegals’, and metaphorical constructions of instances of fear-mongering and constructions of immigration as a threat to an American way of life, in conjunction with the construction of Trump as the only person willing and/or able to address this (unproven) crisis.Trump has existed within the public eye throughout most of his life. In 1971 he took over the family’s real estate business, re-naming it The Trump Organisation, and subsequently produced several televised beauty pageants and became best known for his book The Art of the Deal and hosting reality tv show The Apprentice. He is the sole President to have reached office without first serving either in any public office or in the military, but was instead a celebrity before his inauguration, making his relationship to social media and to the public a particularly unique phenomenon to investigate.Twitter presents a unique angle on Trump’s rhetoric, as expanded upon in the Literature Review: his tweets seem to be unfiltered by speech writers, coming directly from him; tweets force the user to be concise, being limited to 280 characters (previously 140) and thus allows us to avoid the rambling nature of his speeches and public appearances; they are regularly the subject of extensive news coverage; and Trump is an experienced Twitter user, having posted frequently since joining in 2009. The influence of social media in the 2016 election has since come under intense scrutiny after allegations that Cambridge Analytica harvested the data of over 50 million Facebook users in order to better their marketing research for the Trump Presidential campaign (Rosenberg, Confessore & Cadwalldr, 2018), although the nature of the influence of Twitter on public opinion is still unclear, making research into social media all the more pressing.A dialogue on Trump will always, inevitably, lead to a discussion of populism. It has been found that anger is a significant driver in support for populism (Rico, Guinjoan, Anduiza, 2016). Populism has also been found to define national identity by a process of negation, naming a threat (recently more frequently immigration) or what is wrong with those outside of the ideology, forming sovereign identity on the determination that ‘we’ are not like ‘them’ (Gimenez & Schwartz, 2016). This research investigates whether Trump harnesses anger and anxiety in combination with the creation of a sovereign homogenous group, toward immigration and ‘outsiders’.It is clear that increasing support for the right globally has had an influence on the discourse of immigration and the nature of nationality and nationalism. What this research hopes to clarify is whether anti-immigrant rhetoric from Trump is solely playing to this trend or if it functions as a catalyst for feelings of insecurity in the electorate, reinforcing the ‘need’ for harsher immigration control and thus a candidate or President willing to implement it.Trump’s tweets have been the subject of quantitative scholarly enquiry, but this will be one of the earlier studies of his tweets through discourse and qualitative analysis (Pain & Chen, 2019). Much of the scholarly analysis of Trump’s Twitter has been focussed on the form of the tweets (Gross, 2016; Pain & Chen, 2019; et al.) or predicting voting patterns, opinion and sentiment (Tumasjan et al. 2010). This research finds a carefully constructed and maintained effort to create an adversary in the form of those migrating to America, positioning Trump as “the lone outsider who can save the country” (Pain & Chen, 2019) and deliberately employing positive self-representation and negative other-presentation (Kreis, 2017). Theoretically, we draw on Van Dijk’s method of discourse analysis for the research, and investigate previous research on Twitter in the literature review (Pain & Chen, Hong & Nadler et al.), plus theories of disaster capitalism (Klein) and collective, biological and economic insecurity (Lorey & Butler) in the discussion as to theorising the why of the research question.We start by reviewing research on Twitter’s relationship to democracy, populism and politics in general, in combination with previous research on Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric and the nature of Trump’s Twitter discourse. We also review theories of discourse analysis in relation to social media. We then present the expectations and theories of the research, before mapping the methods used and the results. In the discussion we theorise on the paper’s limitations and possible future avenues, as well as the implications for the research and touch upon theories on the results.1.1 Coded Language on TwitterPrevious scholarly research has been heavily focussed on how Trump has used Twitter in aggressive, clumsy and/or absurd ways (Franck, 2019), whether that is through taunts and tirades (Gross et al., 2016), spelling mistakes such as the infamous “covfefe” incident (@realDonaldTrump, May 31st, 2017, 12:06) or how he consistently ends tweets with an emotive word or phrase, such as “sad!” (@realDonaldTrump, May 7th, 2019, 20:15). Very little scholarly attention has been paid to the theory that Trump may use Twitter more prepensely. The paper thus theorises that initially Trump created an “expert language” (Pain & Chen, 2018) that invited many Americans who felt ignored, shunned or forgotten into his inner circle by ‘speaking’ to them through Twitter.Research using social media is increasingly popular among social scientists (Fiesler, 2019). However, studying information from a social media platform like Twitter comes with methodological and conceptual challenges, such as sampling biases arising or vague or unrepresentative sampling frames, as Zeynep Tufekci notes, “the socio-cultural complexity of user behaviour aimed at algorithmic invisibility (such as subtweeting, mock-retweeting, use of “screen captures” for text, etc.) further complicate interpretation of big data social media.” (Tufekci, 2014, p.1). This, combined with analysis of a public figure whose tweets are frequently posted by campaign or administration staff (and thus cannot be wholly assigned to Trump himself) make quantitative analysis of Twitter complex. Therefore, this research, while using some quantitative analysis in order to extract patters within large sums of data, mainly focusses on a qualitative analysis.Twitter has been instrumental in creating a new kind of discourse — a situation in which users speak not directly to each other (unless through responding to each others tweets on a ‘thread’ or via direct, private messages) but broadcasting their speech to their followers and to the wider world in general — as if someone were standing in the street, announcing their opinions. Users are limited to 280 characters (previously 140) within which they must express themselves. Using the “@“ symbol, users can tag or mention other users, and the “#” symbol creates a link to a thread, so that every mention of the hash-tagged word is connected. The hashtag has been especially prolific in marketing and campaigning, in that it reduces a meme to a bitesize hashtag, already connected to a wider context or discussion. For example, the hashtag #LockHerUp is recognisable as a reference to Trump’s ongoing criticism of the handling of the Hillary Clinton email scandal in which 20,000 documents were hacked from John Podesta, Clinton’s campaign chair (Wikileaks, 2016) and his insistence that she should be in jail, regardless of the assurance by James Comey, former FBI Director, that there had been no criminal act (Yuhas et al., 2016).1.2 Truth, Lies and the TwitterscapeTweets have been found to be a form of “discourse which help to create and reproduce systems of social meaning” (Fran Tonkiss, 1998, p.245). There is, on Twitter and in a wider social context, a social construction of discourse specific to members of social circles. In the same way that youths from London have a different language of slang than youths from Manchester, so do members of political spheres on Twitter. Neo-nazis have developed a coded language online that involves meanings behind the use of symbols, for example using an ‘echo’ or triple parentheses, “((( )))” to draw attention to a Jewish name (Hess, 2016). The paper argues that Trump also creates a system of coded language through his tweets, and that he continues to do so successfully; “Crooked Hillary” for example, is a phrase that has been repeated 334 times on Twitter as of the writing of this paper (TrumpTwitterArchive.com). In regard to this conceptual phrase, it is irrelevant if Hillary Clinton is actually “crooked” — followers understand that the phrase is linked to the narrative that Clinton is too close to Wall Street, and thus the same as every other politician before her, except, supposedly, Trump. Consistently associating Clinton’s name with the concept of being “crooked” thus tries to serve multiple purposes; cementing Trump as a populist, ‘anti-big government’ politician; undermining her credibility; and reinforcing the concept that is, fundamentally, just Trump’s opinion, as a socially accepted truth. It is through the development of a coded system that Trump has created his own expert language, the function of which is threefold: “It marks out a field of knowledge; it confers membership; and it bestows authority” (Tonkiss, 1998, p.247).In 2016 the Rand Corporation published an article titled The Russian “Firehose of Falsehood” Propaganda Model. In it, they theorise that President Vladimir Putin and others use a technique of repeatedly and unashamedly lying to the public in order to convince them that these lies were true. They found that not only did it not matter whether a lie contradicted objective reality, repeating a lie forces the viewer to engage in its existence and thus provide it with validity, reducing the concept of ‘truth’ to opinion. It has been found that subjects attitudes towards the target of a lie got worse even after the lie was debunked (Thorson, 2013) and that a falsehood is considered more ethical to tell if it aligns with the subject’s political preferences (Effron, 2018). Trump is quoted on July 25th, 2018 at the Veterans of Foreign Wars National Convention in Kansas City, Missouri as saying “just remember, what you’re seeing and what you’re reading is not what’s happening. Just stick with us, don’t believe that crap that you’re seeing with these people, the fake news”. This paper thus approaches anti-immigrant rhetoric in Trump’s Twitter with skepticism, choosing to let the numbers indicated by research speak as to the situation of immigration in the U.S. rather than solely information disseminated by the Trump administration.It can be theorised that Trump’s falsehoods serve as a filter for loyalty, interchangeable with a sense of ‘faith’; or that followers blindly trust him; or that they are indifferent to falsehoods as they believe every politician lies. When Trump has targeted something, it does not matter what evidence he uses to back himself up and whether this evidence is in fact debunked — the persistent attitude toward the subject remains the same for his followers (Effron, 2018). In discourse analysis, “language is seen not simply as a neutral medium for communicating information, but as a domain in which our knowledge of the social world is actively shaped.” (Tonkiss, 1998, p.245) It deconstructs language to understand it not as a way to transparently present the truth, but a way to construct and organise social reality, in a manner in which “social identities are formed” (Tonkiss, 1998, p.246). Thus, the analysis of his Twitter feed is not an exercise in fact-checking but rather an exercise in noticing trends and patterns that shape the narrative of focus — immigration. His Twitter feed can be seen as a culmination of all that he says in public; ideas and concepts perhaps taking form as and when he says them, the most pertinent (or those which garner the most applause) being reinforced through tweets.1.3 Twitter, Democracy and TransparencyTwitter can be used as an instrument for increased participation and democracy (Pain & Chen, 2019), but has not thus far been proven to shape public opinion, either positively or negatively (Hong & Nadler, 2011). Whether Twitter is causal or transformative in participatory democracy is still up for debate (Pain & Chen, 2019), and its influence on public feeling (whether it incites or encourages anti-immigrant sentiment, for example) has been hard to study up until the presidency of Trump, in which his tweets are not only consumed by his followers but widely disseminated by the media on both the left and the right (Gross & Johnson, 2016), functioning firstly as free advertising and secondly as news-stories within themselves (Pain & Chen, 2019; Gross & Johnson, 2016; Kreis, 2017).Twitter seems to create a space within which political figures can communicate closely with users, without the middle-woman of the press or media (Kreis, 2019). It has been found that Twitter has been used by Presidents and presidential candidates other than Trump as a means through which to spread information and opinion (Ross & Rivers, 2018) rather than to engage with other users or colleagues.Trump’s use of Twitter has been found to use an informal, direct and provocative style to construct the concept of a homogenous people and homeland threatened by immigration (Kreis, 2017). It allows Trump to appear unfiltered (Pain & Chen, 2019), and it is this idea that is key in understanding Trump’s larger discourse. In line with populist tradition, Trump has bolstered an image of himself as a man of the people (Canovan, 1999), claiming to be a businessman who worked his way to become the most powerful person in the country. Arguably it is his history as a public persona and tv personality that has helped justify alleged efforts to “drain the swamp” (October 17th 2016, Trump campaign press release, since deleted) of the political elite, being the first President who has served neither in public office nor the military before serving as President.His tweets have been found to be mainly conversational; he does not often cite reputable news sources, facts or figures and consistently uses language of “incivility” by consistently writing in capital letters or personally attacking others (Pain & Chen, 2019), with a more personal approach than those of other public officials, up until he announced his candidacy, at which point fellow candidates changed their approaches to reflect his (Gross et al. 2016). His manner on and off social media consistently appeared unfiltered; it seemed clear that he handled his own Twitter rather than campaign staff; he frequently went off script when speaking in public; and repeatedly derides efforts to maintain a professional dialogue, insisting that he doesn’t “have time for total political correctness” (Trump, GOP Primary Debate, Cleveland, August 6th, 2015). It is this last element that is the most divisive — and for which his supporters have the clearest rebuttal. They would rather a candidate or President who was unfiltered, and by implication, trustworthy, than a President who only shows a public image and keeps the rest of their thoughts and actions private. This is not to say that Trump is actually trustworthy, but rather that his unfiltered discourse only serves to reinforce his image of a man of the people and thus outside of the political elites.As much as negative and provocative language may produce results and therefore be considered a conscious strategy by politicians, it is also likely to be a product of intuition and prior experience (Gross & Johnson, 2016). This is where the gap in the literature lies in that campaign tone and discourse on Twitter have previously been treated in scholarly research as explanatory variables rather than investigating the driving factors to use said discourses and/or rhetoric (Gross & Johnson, 2016). This research aims to dissect how Trump uses anti-immigrant discourse on Twitter in order to shed light on why he might do so.1.4 The Good ImmigrantAnti-immigration rhetoric centred on the conflation of immigrant status with criminality has been widely debunked. Incarcerated Immigrants in 2016: Their numbers, demographics and Countries of Origin by Michelangelo Landgrave and Alex Nowrasteh uses American Community Survey data from the U.S. census bureau to analyse incarcerated people and their immigrant or native status. They find evidence that shows immigrant status (whether legal or not) actually reduces the likelihood of criminal behaviour in relation to their share of the population. Nonetheless, it has been theorised that from the moment that Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act that conservative whites have been leaving the Democratic Party (Favreau, 2018) and that politics has become increasingly more racialised, up to and including the Trump administration. Former President Barrack Obama’s campaign and administration was, with the help of Trump, constantly discussed in relation to his race; his father being Muslim, the “birther” theories (as of the writing of this paper Trump had tweeted about Obama’s birth certificate 22 times, TrumpTwitterArchive.com), his middle name being Hussein etc. The majority of white people in the U.S. voted against Obama in both elections (Favreau, 2018) including in blue states like California. It has been theorised then, that racial bigotry has always existed within American politics; but Trump has willingly “poured gasoline” (Favreau, 2018) on an issue that other politicians have avoided. Even so, immigration is repeatedly and consistently conflated with criminality and more than that, the concept of “line-cutting” (Edsall, 2016) in which white Americans feel unjustly neglected for the sake of affirmative action, in which immigrants, women, people of colour and other minorities supposedly jump ahead of them in the queue for the American dream (Inglehart & Norris, 2016), moving voters away from the post-materialist boom post World War II (Inglehart & Norris, 2017) and towards populist politics in favour of nationalism. This paper thus takes anti-immigration discourse to be ill-informed and largely false.2 Research design/MethodologyThis research looked at a total of 11,406 tweets from the Twitter account @realDonaldTrump from the day that Donald Trump announced his candidacy for the Presidency on June 16th, 2015 up until the 16th of August 2019, when this research was closed, as collected by Brendan Brown at TrumpTwitterArchive.com. This included 25 sent from a Blackberry mobile device between June 16th, 2015 and July 11th, 2015; 2,118 from an Android mobile device between June 16th, 2015 and March 25th, 2017; and 11,406 tweets from an iPhone mobile device between June 16th 2015 and August 16th 2019 (see Table 1). These tweets were filtered to removed retweets and direct messages to other users using the “.@“ function, so as to remove potential interference of irrelevant data. It was also important to note that not all tweets can be proven to be written by Trump himself as he has had multiple people in his campaign and administration with access to his account. Thus all tweets from the three main devices he allegedly used were collected to avoid bias by researcher selection, using Twitter metadata, as research has shown that Trump tweeted from his personal Android before the inauguration, with one staffer having access to his account, and moving to a mandated government iPhone after (Rosenberg & Haberman, 2018; Newman, 2017; Feinberg, 2017). It is, however, virtually impossible to know for certain. The dataset used is a combination of the archived tweets from the TrumpTwitterArchive, analysed in Atlas.ti. This archive is used rather than the metadata straight from Twitter as it includes tweets that have later been deleted. It was important in this study to include tweets that were deleted as it most closely reflects Trump’s use of Twitter.First the relevant tweets were imported into Atlas.ti with their corresponding dates and coded as “true” of “false” as to whether they were a retweet. Each tweet was imported as a case. Retweets were then removed from the study, leaving the total of 11,406 (Table 1). All 11,406 tweets were then read manually by the researcher. During this initial reading, common themes were noted, as well as expectations that had been met and those that were incorrect. In the second reading, key words and phrases were noted in relation to the research question.The tweets were then analysed quantitatively. First, tweets were analysed in Atlas.ti as to the most common words. All tweets were then coded with words related to immigration and Trump’s specific language on the topic, as noted in the initial readings. Each of these words was manually and then automatically analysed as to find the highest cooccurring word in relation to it, in order to observe trends. Significant words were then selected from the initial analysis for further exploration.Further tweets that warranted further analysis on an individual basis were noted in the first and second readings of the tweets.Quantitative analysis is useful for counting tweets and finding textual patterns — which words are used in concurrence with words such as ‘immigrant’ or ‘danger’, for example. This must also be reinforced by qualitative analysis of the discourse, to remove researcher bias in qualitative analysis and to avoid missing patterns that may be lost in quantitative analysis. For example, when coding a word such as “illegal”, it was necessary to manually read each code within this group so as to differentiate between tweets referring to illegal immigrants and discourse on Hillary Clinton or the Mueller investigation. By diving the tweets into code groups, it was easier to then separate tweets that were relevant to the research and those that weren’t.It is clear that the researcher will always have bias. The intention of manually reading all 11,406 tweets was to try and remove as much of this bias as possible — for the research to have, to the best of it’s ability, interpreted the data as a whole before moving into the specifics of discourse around immigration.3 Analysis/ResultsIn regard to creating an “expert language” within which subtext is understood from those familiar with Trump’s rhetoric, there were trends. It was found that he often capitalises words within a concept or idea that he wishes to emphasise: for example, “Rigged Witch Hunt” (@realDonaldTrump, August 14, 2018) or “Crooked Hillary” (@realDonaldTrump, Oct 16, 2017). He sometimes capitalises full words or sentences, giving the impression that he is shouting, or emphasising what he is saying — although it is less frequent than expected. A certain style is clearly apparent, and can easily divide tweets into categories, for example, a statement is usually ended with one word that rounds off the sentiment, for example; “sad” which is used 64 times at the end of a tweet, or “bad” which ends a tweet 44 times.It was expected that much of the discourse on Trump’s Twitter feed would be slanderous or critical of his opponents: there was a significant chunk of the tweets that were of this nature, but contrary to expectations the nature of the tweets were more positive than negative. For example, he congratulated others in 258 different tweets. When referring to opponents, his critics or people he simply does not seem to like, he will frequently use derogative language that dehumanised them: “Good work by General Kelly for firing that dog” (@realDonaldTrump, August 14th, 2018). He uses the phrase “Animal Assad” in three tweets (@realDonaldTrump, twice on the 8th April 2018, and once on the third of November 2017).The most frequent use of Twitter for Trump appears to be for gossip or interjection into public discourse. On initial reading it was found that he spent a large portion of time either endorsing or congratulating people, or injecting his own opinion into a public discussion, such as directly tweeting at American television show Fox and Friends; or criticising opponents, whether through personal snipes or prolonged, multi-tweet threads of what essentially appears as ranting. All of this discourse can be catalogued as reactionary tweeting: tweets that respond to perceived successes or failures of his peers and/or responses to news stories about himself. This is the bulk of the discourse on his feed, contrary to our expectations.There is a subtext to most of the discourse on immigration, which is that the rhetoric is in relation to people of colour. This is not explicitly said but through further research it seems to be inherent in the discourse. The majority of the time that Trump is discussing immigration he is either referring to immigrants from Mexico, or (explicitly) Syrians. Occasionally he lets the reader make this connection themselves, by using phrases like “certain people” (12 times in relation to immigration) with a wink and a nod that you know what he means. Trump has denounced implications of racism, for example by tweeting “I am the least racist person” (@realDonaldTrump, August 6th, 2019, 05:57) and yet, announcements of (unproven) statistics on African-American and minority unemployment levels still seemed to sit uneasily within the narrative.We theorised that those tweets referring to African-American and minority unemployment levels reveal a subtext within themselves. At no point does Trump refer to overall unemployment levels in the U.S. — he specifically references unemployment in minorities. Although it is not specifically stated, this can be interpreted as more of a coded discourse than initially apparent; rather than celebrating (again, unproven) lower levels of unemployment, it seems more likely to feed into racial stereotyping — mainly, the deeply offensive and racist misconception that people of colour are unemployed because they are avoiding work. And thus, through this discourse, he is not in actual fact misinforming his followers about false unemployment numbers, but reassuring his followers that he is making people work. This may seem like a bit of a reach — but in the context of other public actions in which he interacts with people of colour, he has repeatedly shown himself to be bigoted (buying the NFL players KFC when they came to the white house; publicly criticising Colin Kaepernick for taking the knee at basketball games to protest police violence; infamously failing to criticise nazi protestors after the death of a protestor in Charlottesville and later saying in a speech that there were “some very fine people on both sides” (Press Conference at Trump Tower on August 15th, 2017); or allegedly referring to countries with majority people of colour as “shithole countries” and implying that the US needed migrants from places such as Norway, a majority white country (Beckwith, 2018)).As expected, the overall tone of the discourse was informal. Trump rarely uses complicated language, although this might just be a reflection of the way he speaks, rather than a conscious choice to appeal to as wide an audience as possible.4.1 Immigration as a direct threatNoticeably references to immigration and anti-immigrant rhetoric were less frequent than expected. Through the initial analysis of keywords it was discovered that mentions of immigration specifically were relatively small. However, when these references were made, there was a clear pattern. Immigration was not tweeted about in a positive light in a single case. It was when looking at the highest cooccurring words (Table 4) that patterns became clearest. 66% of the instances in which “aliens” were mentioned it was in cooccurrence with the word “illegal” and “criminal”. The next most cooccurring words were “border” with a 41% rate, and “violent” with a 12% rate. In not a single tweet that included the word “aliens” was the discourse positive. This trend repeated with the word “immigrant”, with the highest cooccurring word “illegal” at a frequency of 86%, and border at 44%; and with “illegals”, a slang word used in reference to immigrants used 277 times by Trump in the analysis, the highest cooccurrence was with the word “border” with 71% and “Mexico” with 47%. These words and phrases create almost a loop in this analysis, where a mention of one of these key words inevitably led back to another. Rather than the conversation on immigration having a broad range, there is a specific narrative that arises. The narrative groups together most, if not all, immigrants with the label of “illegal” and “aliens”.Analysis of tweets containing the words “immigrant”, “aliens” and “illegals”, can thus all be used almost interchangeably with little difference in surrounding discourse. Immigration is consistently discussed as a large, impending crisis. “Pouring” was frequently used alongside “big flow”, “caravan”, “invaded”, “surge” and “large numbers”. This subtext of an imagined wave or ‘pouring in’ of people was supported by more explicit language, such as “South Carolina needs strength as illegals and Syrians pour in” (@realDonaldTrump, 20th February, 2016, 17:02), and “tens of thousands of illegals are being apprehended (captured)” (@realDonaldTrump, 3rd September, 2019, 22:13). The nature of the immigrants was also made clear — or at least, Trump’s opinion of them. Most noticeably, more than discourse on the economy or alleged “line-cutting” was the implication (or more frequently statement) that immigrants were dangerous: which supports our second hypothesis, Trump’s discourse on Twitter is expected to have positioned immigrants as a direct threat to American citizens. Frequently immigrants were described as “criminal”, “violent”, “dangerous”, “guilty”, “offenders” who were trading in “drugs” and “human trafficking”. Immigrants were accused of being “set free to prey on innocent Americans” (@realDonaldTrump, March 13th, 2018, 10:27); they were frequently accused of committing violent crimes without citation or evidence, for example in one tweet “five people killed in Washington State by a middle eastern immigrant” (@realDonaldTrump, September 25th, 2016, 07:18).It was further suggested that stronger border security (and by extension, less immigration) would “save american lives” (@realDonaldTrump, November 4th, 2016, 01:46), with frequent hyperbole that suggested a “National Emergency at the Southern Border” (@realDonaldTrump, March 17th, 2019, 03:58), or that “this is a public safety crisis” (@realDonaldTrump, April 17th, 2018, 04:34).4.2 Trump as America’s SaviourThere were 32 instances in which he explicitly says that he is the only person capable of solving key issues, two of which were directly related to immigration, “Our southern border is unsecure[sic]. I am the only one that can fix it” (@realDonaldTrump, July 3rd, 2015) and “Such a big problem for our country-I can solve” (@realDonaldTrump, August 26th, 2016); and one which explicitly conflates ISIS and border security, and by proxy, immigration, “5,000 ISIS fighters have infiltrated Europe.Also,many in U.S. I TOLD YOU SO! I alone can fix this problem!” (@realDonaldTrump, March 24th, 2016). An expected and clear narrative that Trump created was a criticism of the handling of immigration from the Obama administration; and the attitudes of Democrats who were allegedly “protecting MS-13 thugs” (@realDonaldTrump, May 26th, 2018). Frequently when he endorsed a fellow Republican it was in the context of their attitudes toward border security, and disparagements of Democrats was consistency in relation to their seemingly poor immigration policies. This leads us to the third hypothesis, Trump is expected to present himself as the only person capable of managing an alleged migrant crisis. Our research found that Trump presents himself as the only person capable of mentioning anything — not just immigration. When referring to himself he frequently uses words such as “best”, “only”, “win” or “winning” and “great”. One particularly insightful tweet reads “Nobody will protect our Nation like Donald J. Trump. Our military will be greatly strengthened and our borders will be strong. Illegals out!” (@realDonaldTrump, March 26th 2016).4.3 America Against the WorldMuch of the analysis tacitly infers results as to the first hypothesis, Trump is likely to create a discourse on the subject of immigration that pits Americans against immigrants in an ‘us’ vs. ‘them’ rhetoric. An ‘us’ vs. ‘them’ narrative is thus more implied than explicit, contrary to what we expected. This may come from the sense that Trump is consistently tweeting to his loyal fanbase and followers — the ‘us’ does not require creating as it is implicit within the narrative. The techniques and language used on Twitter creates the sense that Trump is conversing with his friends; letting you in on the truth, revealing what is ‘really’ happening.In conjunction with this implicit creation of the communal ‘us’ together with Trump, the idea of immigrants as outsiders is a given. Trump does not need to state that immigrants are not ‘like us’ — he knows who his audience is, and his platform from the beginning has been one of othering immigrants and even the ‘dreamers’ or children who were born in the U.S. to immigrant parents. This narrative is thus not as explicitly clear in the research. Although we could reach a conclusion on the narrative of ‘us’ vs. ‘them’, it would be hard to reach without researcher bias interfering with the results. Inferring from the language used does create some expectations, but these are left largely down to the individual’s interpretation.ConclusionsIt has been said that every great President has his war. And if there is no literal war, incumbent Presidents repeatedly have been found to find a new threat to combat in order to project an image of themselves and their administration as necessary in order to combat said threat. Examples include former President Bill Clinton’s “war on drugs” (which disproportionately incarcerated African-American men on petty drug charges), or former President George Bush and former Prime Minister of England Tony Blair’s “war on terror” (in which a desire to control Middle-Eastern oil supplies was hidden under the guise of a threat of nuclear weapons). We can also see examples of this at mid-term elections, dubbed the “October Surprise”, in which public or social ‘surprise’ crises are levied to garner support from opposing prospective or incumbent candidates. Examples of this include the Ebola crisis in 2014; the Clinton email scandal in 2016; the Osama bin Laden tape in 2004; and Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Each of these cases have even cited in Naomi Klein’s theory of “disaster capitalism” (2007). She posits that economic, climate or terrorist crises or threats are exploited by politicians in order to profit from the fear created by such events. This theory can be applied to examples of election scandals that capitalise on fear in the American voters in order to sway their votes directly before an election. Extensive research has been conducted into how crises affect voting patterns and Presidential support, such as Voting After the Bombings: A Natural Experiment on the Effect of Terrorist Attacks on Democratic Elections by Jose G.Montalvo, and Are Voters Sensitive to Terrorism? Direct Evidence from the Israeli Electorate by Claude Berrebi and Estban F Klor.The biggest question that arises from this research is why Trump has such a strong anti-immigrant narrative in his discourse. We draw upon Naomi Klein’s The Shock Doctrine and Isabell Lorey’s State of Insecurity to theorise that Trump creates a sense of insecurity and cultural vulnerability that he then exploits in order to be necessary to the American electorate. If he is the only one talking about a crisis, then by implication he is the only one willing to solve it. He then reinforces the narrative that he can solve this crisis explicitly, whilst positing the concept that he is the most capable. These two books address similar themes; the effects of collective trauma on governance, politics and power.Klein’s work first looks at the effects of shock treatment on the individual. She looks at research undertaken by the CIA in the 1950s that discovered a new form of torture in order to get the subject into a state where they would be malleable enough to submit to authority; shocking them into a state where they regressed into a childlike fear, in which they are more inclined to do what they are told and trust what they are told. She shows that these techniques don’t just work on individuals, but whole societies too. In the aftermath of terrorist attacks, climate or economic crises, civil wars or dictatorships, societies are left in a state of collective shock and uncertainty, making them vulnerable to collective manipulation; “countries are shocked — by wars, terror attacks, coup d’état and natural disasters. And then they are shocked again — by corporations and politicians who exploit the fear and disorientation of this first shock to push through economic shock therapy” (Klein, 2007, p.26–27). She tracks how Milton Friedman developed this technique and advised politicians around the world on how and when to take advantage of the state of shock that societies are left in after these crises, by pushing through reforms or austerity measures that citizens might otherwise have resisted.Isabell Lorey states “just as the discourse of ‘financial crisis’ can and does work to sore up the need for greater managerial control of the market […], so the discourse of ‘precarity’ consolidates power among those who wield the power to alternately promise its alleviation and threaten its continuation.” The paper theorises that Trump is creating his own war, and his own shock in which to leave Americans in a state of uncertainty, requiring a saviour who will offer them a magic cure — and that that is exactly what he does, through self-congratulatory rhetoric and populist nationalism that pits the American people against a common enemy — in this case, the traumatic assault of an influx of “criminal” immigrants.By Daisy Bata, originally written as a Master’s Thesis on the Political Science Master’s at the Universitat Autónoma de Barcelona in August 2019ReferencesKlein, Naomi.

Ambiguities and buzz of Development,https://medium.com/@pragya.srivastava2405/ambiguities-and-buzz-of-development-73d08738dff5?source=tag_archive---------9-----------------------,"Development,Social Science,Political Science,Perspective,Sociology","Landmarks in the trajectory of the term Development.Development has remained a vogue word, nobody seems to understand what it means or what it wants to achieve but everyone wants to get ‘developed’. Despite the ambiguities associated with the term, it has remained popular and asserted its domination in the shape of institutions, ideologies practices, and policies.The discourse and practice of development are at a condemnatory intersection. Development was born as an aid, an expression of the modern obsession with caring. Development was also born in the context of the Cold War. Gustavo Esteva argues that underdevelopment was invented, and by changing the meaning of the word development, an emblem and euphemism were created placing the USA in an indisputable position. Since Truman gave his inaugural address on January 20, 1949, the dawn of underdevelopment had begun, and ever since development has “connoted at least one thing: to escape from the vague, indefinable, and undignified condition known as underdevelopment.” (Esteva, Gustava. “The Development Dictionary”. Development. Zed Books, 1992)Harry S Tuman Photo by Library of Congress on UnsplashGilbert Rist in ‘The History of Development: From Western Origins to Global Faith’ asserts the fact that development has remained a buzzword and implies a lot more than it means. Moreover, the definition of development comes with preconditions and presuppositions. Rist goes on to ask the question if the popular definitions of development are in fact operational definitions or it is just a fetish or a plastic word. Every modern government activity, the establishment of factories, opening educational institutions are labeled as development. Rist further says the problem with the definition of development is that the explanation comes from the believers of development who undoubtedly will advocate it and negate whatever harms them. The term development has had an interesting trajectory at different time frames and it explains how it has gone metamorphoses in the words of Rist. What is interesting here is that the idea of development does not seem to go away, Esteva calls it an unburied corpse. Wolfgang Sachs goes on to say that development stands like a ruin in the intellectual landscape, ‘delusion’, ‘disappointment’ and ‘crime’ have become adjectives to describe the failure of development.Borrowing from BiologyDevelopment in biological usage describes a process through which the potentialities of an object or an organism are released until it reaches its natural, complete, full-fledged form. Hence the metamorphic use of the term to explain the natural growth of plants and animals. Thereby the term became familiar with positive growth and desirable change. The social sphere borrowed from the biological connotation and development started to assert transformation in the political and social arenas. It had strong vernacular power and legitimized colonialism and turned history into the program. Development was overloaded with meanings that became part of the ordinary language in the 19th century. (Esteva, Gustava. “The Development Dictionary”. Development. Zed Books, 1992)Linking development with biological parlance further asserts that development is an inevitable process, something which cannot be escaped. ‘Directionality’, ‘continuity’, ‘cumulativeness’, and ‘irreversibility’ are the four features associated with the development of an organism and these can be applied to development in a socio-political setting as well. Development further goes on to deepen its ties with the positive biological connotation and hence legitimizing its position in the society by evoking a strong tradition stretching throughout the history of the world. (Rist, Gilbert. The History of Development: From Western Origins to Global Faith. Zed Books,2002)Landmarks in the trajectory of the term ‘Development’Aristotle and AntiquityAntiquity relied on two sources of knowledge, one relation to myth and the other relating to the knowledge of the philosophers. Among all the themes, the theme of change was the most persistent one. According to the mythological tradition, the transformation of the world was explained in various ages, and each of them unfolded in a cycle of growth, apogee, and decline. This understanding of evolution could also be applied in the everyday experience of the common plant and humans which helped in reinforcing the veracity of the myth.Against this backdrop, Aristotle (384–322 BCE) was trying to ground scientific reality by scientific knowledge by distinguishing between what can be known for certain and what depends on unforeseeable circumstances. There was thus a radical break from history by trying to grasp the sequence of causes determined by necessity. For Aristotle, the field of science was co-extensive with nature. For him, nature means the geneses of the moving things that participate in the process of growth, and nature in the primary sense is the essence of things which have in themselves a source of movement, a process of becoming and growing. This being the case Science according to Aristotle can be defined as a theory of nature that is the development of things and to examine things scientifically is to consider them according to their nature that is their development. For Aristotle nature is not confined only to the modern understanding of it but everything that has ‘physis’ of its own i.e. a principle of development. Nature assigns the final stage which corresponds to its perfect form but it does not mean that development can go on to an unlimited extent. Aristotle remains faithful to the theory of cycles which is the persistence in change and ceaseless return of the same. (Rist, Gilbert. ‘The History of Development: From Western Origins to Global Faith’.Zed Books,2002) Aristotle’s views spread to the entire ancient world and explanations how it was natural for an imperial power to draw to a close taking the case of the Roman Empire.Saint Augustine and the Theology of HistoryHe attempted to reconcile the philosophy of history of time with Christian theology. It was a major shift from the Aristotelian point of view in a number of ways. For instance, history was God’s intervention for him, unlike Aristotle who refused to get involved in the accidents of history and concentrated on the force of development. Christianity added supernature to nature and replaced personal growth with divine omnipotence. Aristotle allowed both for change and return of the same but Christianity could not conceive of the return of the same for history unfolded according to God’s plan. Augustine applies constituents of the cyclical theory by applying them to history as a whole. He considers natural phenomena and socio-historical events as an expression of God’s plan for humanity. The most significant break in his theory is breaking away from a cyclical growth to a single one corresponding to the history of salvation. Augustine’s work influenced the history of development in three aspects. Firstly, his philosophy of history in the history of salvation concerns the whole humankind, unlike earlier authors who were focused on the local. Secondly, history does occupy an important place, but this is secondary to the philosophy of history. Thirdly, history does obey necessity, and God’s design will inevitably come to pass. (Rist, Gilbert. ‘The History of Development: From Western Origins to Global Faith’.Zed Books,2002).The Enlightenment and Infinite ProgressDisputes among scholars concerning the superiority of classical Greek and Roman authors over contemporary writers have occurred at least since the time of the Renaissance. In the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, however, such debates turned into heated conflicts, particularly in France and England. Ancients who upheld the authority of the writers of antiquity in intellectual matters — against the Moderns — who maintained that writers of the present day possessed greater knowledge and more-refined tastes than their predecessors. Underlying these positions were fundamental assumptions regarding the state of the art, culture, and human knowledge. The Ancients viewed Greco-Roman civilization as the apex of human achievement and all subsequent culture as a decline from this high point. Thus, they contended, Moderns were in no position to judge the ancients, who were their superiors. The Moderns, on their side, saw human knowledge and understanding as progressing since antiquity. They considered classical works as admirable in certain respects, but also crude and in need of correction and improvement.What remains from this debate between the ancients and the moderns is the principle of growth. The ideology of progress acquired a dominant position in the 17th century. According to Rist even if development never ceased to be regarded in the western tradition, they were long kept in check by the awareness of a limit but soon this barrier was collapsed placing development on infinite progress.Triumphs of Social EvolutionismIn the 19th century, it was a general belief that progress has the same path and all nations travel the same road and not all societies develop at the rate of Westernized societies which play a dominant role in the technological, scientific advancement and the only societies to survive will be those of industry multiplies. Here we should distinguish Charles Darwin's theory of evolutionism with social evolutionism. Social evolutionism is a theory of history whereas Darwin’s theory is a biological evolutionism. It becomes extremely important to highlight the fact that at a political level, social evolutionism legitimized the new wave of colonialism which was a feature of the late 19th century. (Rist, Gilbert. ‘The History of Development: From Western Origins to Global Faith’.Zed Books,2002).Development is a shapeless slime that structures itself according to the conditions of society and finds a way to stay alive. In the 20th century, development took the form of urban development based on homogenous mass production. It gave a legal color to colonialism by promising to vanish the undignified conditions of underdevelopment. The Truman Design was so planned to establish the hierarchy of the initiatives that the ‘modernizers’ want to promote. Esteva points out in the same context that in Latin America, the Peace Corps, the Point Four Program, and Alliance for Progress contributed to the root notion of underdevelopment. For them, Truman had simply replaced backwardness with underdevelopment. (Esteva, Gustava. “The Development Dictionary”. Development. Zed Books, 1992)Development was very soon reduced only to economic growth as echoed in the UN Charter 1947. Walter Rostow in his Non-Communist Manifesto gives a description of the economic growth and its stages (primitive economy, preconditions for take-off, take-off, maturity, and mass consumption) all of them being short-sighted economic policies assuming the character of all the societies in a single variable. Development was reduced to economic growth in terms of GNP and GDP.Once it was realized that economic growth and development were not enough, soon the social factor was included in the meaning of development in the 1960s evident from the creation of the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development in 1963. The 1960s is also called the first developmental decade. One of the major change that was seen as that social change was seen as a precondition for economic growth.The 1970s is referred to as the second developmental decade. Again it is interesting to note that despite the debate on the optimism of economic growth, the idea of GNP does not go away, social development is added on the shelf of economic development. Robert McNamara, president of World Bank raised the point that after recognizing a high level of economic growth does not bring satisfactory in the first decade, the 1970s should see something more than something than gross measures of economic growth. Problems of environment, hunger, population, women, and employment were brought to the forefront. In 1974 the Declaration of Cocoyoc emphasized that the purpose of ‘development’ should also to develop man not just things. The idea of human-centered had come as another development under the proposals of the Dag Hammarskjold Foundation in 1975.The next decade, the 1980s, was called the lost decade for development. The adjustment process meant for many countries abandoning or dismantling, in the name of development, most of the previous achievements. By 1985, a post-development age seemed to be in the offing. The 1990s, by contrast, have given birth to a new development ethos. According to Rist, this follows two clearly distinguishable lines. In the North, it calls for redevelopment — that is, to develop again what was mal-developed or is now obsolete. Conceptually and politically, redevelopment is now taking the shape of sustainable development, for our common future, as prescribed by the Brundtland Commission. In the South, the redevelopment also requires dismantling what was left by the adjustment process of the 1980s, in order to make room for the leftovers from the North (atomic waste, obsolete or polluting manufacturing plants, unsellable or prohibited commodities). (Esteva, Gustava. “The Development Dictionary”. Development. Zed Books, 1992)Interesting in this regard is the work of A.G. Frank who addresses a periodic presentation of the history of the world system. Both the processes of development and underde­velopment commenced in the mercantile period (1500–1770), carried through into industrial capitalism (1770–1870), and culminated in imperialism (1870–1930). Throughout the process, the colonies, semi-colonies, and neo-colonies existed primarily for the benefit of the capitalist metropolis and as a direct result became underdeveloped.The developed/underdeveloped dichotomy that continues to this day. The future of development studies lies in archaeology, to explore the ruins it left behind by looking at development’s pre-history and conceptual history, as well as the development enterprise. The meaning of development to date remains vague but the idea is not going away but rather seeking different ways to stay alive. In this era, development comes to mean escaping underdevelopment. So to develop you first have to be seen as underdeveloped in the eyes of the developer. Esteva calls this colonizing anti-colonialism. Underdevelopment becomes a new word for backwardness and poverty; the very social conditions that legitimize foreign intervention or neo-colonialism. This new form of foreign intervention has one key feature according to Esteva: economic growth. Money is seen as the only way of escaping underdevelopment.The meaning of the term development remains formless, tending to refer to a set of beliefs and assumptions about the nature of social progress rather than to anything more precise. Development was born as a promise to escape the realities of poverty but more than anything it has promoted conditions of supposed underdevelopment and some leaning countries is playing forever catch-up with the leading countries.Written byPragya SrivastavaPolitical Science Major who finds everything amusing.Follow101 101 101 DevelopmentSocial SciencePolitical SciencePerspectiveSociologyMore from Pragya SrivastavaFollowPolitical Science Major who finds everything amusing.More From MediumOn Disagreeing with PlatoDavid J.

"<strong class=""bt"">Beyond Surveys: What Games Tell Us About Liberals &amp; Conservatives</strong>",https://medium.com/@rosayted/beyond-surveys-what-games-tell-us-about-liberals-conservatives-c3dd528f4d91?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Political Science,Conservatives,Liberals,Values,Psychology","The First Actions in a “Trust” Game Experiment(This is a Literature Review article. It includes links to all sources used, but it has not been “peer-reviewed” itself. I am posting it to provoke thought and further research.)Imagine you’ve agreed to play a game for psychological research. No response is “right” or “wrong.” The experimenter says you’ve been given a fixed amount of money and the option to contribute some or all of that money to a fund that earns interest. The catch is, at the end of the game, all of the money in that fund will distributed equally to all of the players — regardless of whether they contributed to the fund. Would you contribute to the fund? Not everyone gives the same answer. But there are patterns to their answers.Social groups are composed of individuals. Individuals have psychological differences. Over the past few decades, we’ve learned that those differences include differences in value priorities. Moreover, there are patterns to those differences.Many political psychologists call these patterns “political orientations.” A lot of their research has relied on surveys that ask participants to report their beliefs, values, attitudes and preferences. I’ve written several articles about their discoveries [such as this one]. But surveys aren’t perfect. Some people might be dishonest. The questions themselves might be biased.Yet researchers using game experiments appear to be uncovering similar phenomena. And these game experiments don’t have the same issues as surveys: “actions speak louder than words,” as we say. What you do in the game reveals what you really value, and how much. So game experiments give us another way to test relationships between personal value priorities and “political orientations,” such as “Conservative” and “Liberal.”A variety of these games have been developed by Social Psychologists. Among the most popular are “The Prisoner’s Dilemma,” “The Dictator Game,” “The Ultimatum Game” and “The Public Goods Game.” You can click on their names to get Wikipedia descriptions. I want to focus on what we’ve learned from these experiments.One lesson has been that different people have different goals when they engage in a social exchange. We often assume that everyone acts on the basis of their self-interest, just concerning themselves with what they will personally gain from an exchange. Game experimenters have found this isn’t true. Some players behave this way. Experimenters have given this type of player labels like “proself,” “self-oriented” and “individualist.” But they’ve also found players who consider the outcomes for other participants in the exchange, players who are sensitive to inequity and seek equality of outcomes. Researchers have given this kind of player labels like “prosocial,” “communally-oriented” and “socially-oriented.” Some experimenters say there’s a third type of player, a “competitor,” one who is “competition-oriented” and “seeks to enhance the difference between outcomes for self and others in favor of the self.” But “competitors” are ultimately a lot like “individualists:” in the end, they are attempting to maximize their personal gain. “Prosocials,” on the other hand, differ from both “competitors” and “individualists” in their concern for the outcomes of other participants.Game experimenters then discovered that these social value orientations — “individualist” and “prosocial” — were associated with real-world preferences, actions and attitudes:“…there is a spontaneous cooperation effect for prosocial but not for proself [‘individualist’] persons.”“Participants classified having a prosocial value orientation showed higher voluntary tax compliance compared to participants with a proself [‘individualist’] value orientation..”“Relative to individualists and competitors, prosocials reported to engage in a greater number of donations, especially donations to organizations aimed at helping the poor and the ill.”[With regard to a proposed program to reduce transportation pollution,] “Proself participants were more likely to send letters opposing the program, whereas prosocial participants were more likely to send letters of support…proself participants reported higher perceptions of personal costs associated with the program.”“…prosocials, relative to proselves, exhibited greater preferences for commuting by public transportation, and were more concerned with the collective outcomes (i.e., environment) of their decisions.”Experimenters decided to check whether there were any links between these social value orientations and the values identified by Shalom Schwartz in his “Theory of Basic Values.” That’s a set of values theoretically held by people everywhere, to different degrees: the values of “universalism,” benevolence, conformity, tradition, security, power, achievement, hedonism, stimulation, and self-direction. Schwartz theorizes that “universalism” [concern for all people and for nature] combines with benevolence to form the motivation of “self-transcendence.” Power and achievement combine to form the motivation of “self-enhancement.” I mention these two value combinations, or motivations, because they did pop out in the research on Schwartz values and “Social Value Orientation” [“SVO”]:“…we found egoistic concerns to be positively correlated with self-enhancement and negatively with self-transcendence…individualists and competitors (i.e., proselfs) scored significantly higher on egoistic environmental concerns than did people with a pro-social value orientation.”“…we expected self-transcendence to be positively associated with more prosocial orientations…Our main result confirmed that self-transcendence was positively correlated with SVO….”In other words, “proselfs” placed greater value on power and achievement (“self-enhancement”), and “prosocials” placed greater value on univeralism and benevolence (“self-transcendence”). This sounds familiar. In two previous essays [here and here], I wrote about “Social Dominance Orientation” and its links to Schwartz values. “Social Dominance Orientation,” or “SDO,” is described as “…a general attitudinal orientation toward intergroup relations, reflecting whether one generally prefers such relations to be equal, versus hierarchical, that is, ordered along a superior-inferior dimension…people who are more social-dominance oriented will tend to favor hierarchy-enhancing ideologies and policies, whereas those lower on SDO will tend to favor hierarchy-attenuating ideologies and policies.” Psychologist Bob Altemeyer investigated this concept and found that there was a strong association between people who were more social-dominance oriented and greater value for “Power,” as defined by Shalom Schwartz: the value of “Social status and prestige, control or dominance over people and resources.”So it looks like “Social Value Orientation” research is uncovering value associations like those found in surveys of “Social Dominance Orientation.” The “individualists” and “competitors” identified in SVO game experiments are like the subjects who score high for SDO: they are most concerned with getting what they want and coming out on top, so they place a higher value on Power, for the motive of self-enhancement.I’m guessing Ayn Rand had a “Pro-Self” orientationStudies have already established that certain Schwartz values are associated with political preferences:“Regarding values, center-left voters were higher than center-right voters in universalism, benevolence, and self-direction and lower in security, power, achievement, conformity, and tradition.” [italics added]“Study 1 showed that a proself orientation was associated to right-wing political orientation through the mediation of RWA [‘Right-Wing Authoritarianism’] and SDO [‘Social Dominance Orientation’]…Study 3 indicated that a proself orientation was related to prejudice through the intervention of social worldviews, RWA and SDO.” [italics added]The same is true for SVO: “…people with individualistic and competitive orientations are more likely to hold conservative political preferences and to vote for conservative parties than are people with prosocial orientations.” [italics added]Is this a matter of different reasoning or different impulse? A team of neuroscientists investigated this question, using the “Social Value Orientation” paradigm. First they identified test individuals as “prosocial,” “individualist” or “competitive,” based on a task of money distribution. Then they asked the test individuals to indicate a level of preference for various reward distributions. The neuroscientists then scanned the brains of the test individuals and found that, when there was a big difference in rewards, prosocials showed increased amygdala activity, whereas individualists showed only a slight correlation. The reaction did not involve the prefrontal cortex, which is associated with calculation. The researchers therefore concluded that the prosocial response to large differences in rewards was more of an intuitive response, i.e., more of an impulse.Why does all this matter? First, the research on Social Value Orientation (SVO) adds to the knowledge we’ve gained from research on Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO). We’ve learned a lot about the differences between Conservatives and Liberals in their value priorities and motivations. I hope the scientists investigating these concepts compare notes and share ideas, to expand our knowledge of political psychology even further. Second, the research on SVO research helps to further explain differences in ideologies and policy goals of political parties and factions. For example, I think SVO research helps to explain the Republican Party’s focus on individual, rather than cooperative, responses to social problems. Their “individualist” SVO inclines them against prosocial — “socialist” — government policies.That second point is the reason I’ve written this essay and posted it now. I’ve been reading the the history of US political parties and trying to identify the value priorities and political orientations of their members over time. As in the case of the Republican Party, the results of SVO research add a helpful dimension. Since I hope to post my findings some day, I thought it best to introduce this research first.AFTERNOTES:Based on my reading of the literature on political psychology, I’ve mostly been analyzing political behavior in terms of RWA/SDO inclinations and their associated Schwartz values. Professional treatments of this approach have been presented by Christopher David DeSante, in his “Theory of Values-Based Partisanship,” and John T. Jost et al. in their theory of “Motivated Social Cognition.” They use different terminologies, but I think they’re presenting the same or similar ideas.I also sense that this is the root of the Optimates-Populares distinction observed by Cicero, Machiavelli and others.

The Other Side Is More Rational Than You Think,https://arcdigital.media/the-other-side-is-more-rational-than-you-think-2137349204c7?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Politics,Polarization,Political Science,Psychology,Philosophy","(Getty/Arc)Polarization is rising in the United States. We all know it. We can sense it. Beyond our own impressions, it’s what the data clearly tells us. Year by year, members of each party agree more amongst themselves, and less with the other side. As a result, they increasingly demonize the other side. From 1994 to 2016, the percentage of Republicans with “very unfavorable” attitudes toward the Democratic Party rose from 21 percent to 58 percent, with a whopping 91 percent having an overall “unfavorable” attitude. The numbers for Democrats are similar.Why is this happening? It has become commonplace to point to irrational causes as the drivers of polarization: people are subject to reasoning errors like confirmation bias, motivated reasoning, identity-protective cognition, biased assimilation of evidence, and so on.What we are told is that these biases have led people to misuse the internet: they tend to look only at news sources that agree with their beliefs, to share and promote only articles that confirm them, to talk with and trust only those who agree with them, and so on. And that, we are told, is why we are polarized.Hateful HobbyistsReview of Politics is for Power by Eitan Hersh and Why We’re Polarized by Ezra Kleinarcdigital.mediaThis irrationalist explanation of polarization is familiar and intuitive.It’s also wrong.There’s a simple and compelling argument that we can’t view polarization as due primarily to irrational causes.To see why, take some political belief on which Americans are sharply polarized — say, whether Trump is doing a good job. (Current polling: Republicans: 92 percent; Democrats: 4 percent.) For the sake of argument, let’s imagine you think he’s not doing a good job.Now ask yourself: how did you form this opinion about Trump? I’m guessing you won’t say: “Due to confirmation bias and motivated reasoning, I listened primarily to sources that told me what I wanted to hear, and discredited information that suggested otherwise. That’s why I came to think he’s doing a bad job.”You won’t say that because you can’t believe that. Put bluntly: it’s incoherent to think, “Trump’s doing a bad job — but I’m irrational to believe that.” After all, you can’t believe that your own beliefs are irrational. More generally: to the extent that you think your confidence in your opinions is irrationally placed, you must become less confident in those opinions.This means that if you are to hold onto your political beliefs, then you must think that you formed them in a largely rational way. (As, I imagine, you do.)Human Beings Are Intrinsically Tribal. So Of Course Our Politics Will Also Be.Amy Chua on the inherently tribal nature of American politicsarcdigital.mediaBy extension, you must think similarly about those who agree with you on politics. For no one can sensibly think to themselves, “I formed my beliefs rationally — but all my friends, who agree with me and formed their beliefs in similar ways, did so irrationally.” That means that you must think that those on your side of the political divide formed their opinions, by and large, rationally.Here’s the catch: the evidence is resounding that the mechanisms that drive polarization — confirmation bias, motivated reasoning, biased assimilation, and so on — are bipartisan: both sides are equally susceptible to them.That means that the other side formed their beliefs through the same processes that your side did. We’ve seen that you can’t believe your side is irrational. So it follows that you shouldn’t think the other side is, either.That’s not to say you shouldn’t think they’re wrong. You should. After all, your belief that Trump’s not doing a good job was rationally formed. The other side believes that he is doing a good job. Their belief is inconsistent with yours. So you should think that their belief is wrong.But just because you think it’s wrong doesn’t mean you need to think it was formed irrationally. As we’ve seen, you shouldn’t think that — at least, not if you want to both hold onto your own belief and respect the psychological evidence.Of course, you might try to point to various asymmetries between the parties to justify thinking the other side is less rational than you. Trump is, indeed — how do I put this softly? — more erratic than Democratic leaders. AOC is, indeed, a socialist — which is, to many Republicans, a stronger pejorative. And so on. There are plenty of differences between the parties.The trouble is, those differences aren’t what make the difference. Let me explain.We know what psychological mechanisms drive people to polarize: confirmation bias, motivated reasoning, selective exposure to news and opinions, and so on. As we’ve seen, such mechanisms are not correlated with the various asymmetries between the parties. This means you shouldn’t use such partisan asymmetries to conclude that the other side is less rational than yours. What, then, should you conclude?You should conclude that those asymmetries explain why the other side has been misled. Rational mechanisms — the same ones that have led you to your beliefs — have led them to see very different information, to interpret shared information in very different ways, and so on. Fortunately, these processes have led you to the truth about Trump. Unfortunately, they have led them away from it. (They, of course, should draw the exact opposite conclusion.)Why Polarization Won’t Go AwayMost people agree that politics has become too hostile, toxic, and polarized. So why does it remain that way?arcdigital.mediaThat is what you should think about our polarized politics. But can you? Is this story consistent with the empirical evidence about polarization?Yes. The standard irrationalist narrative consists of two parts. Part 1 is an empirical account of the mechanisms (“confirmation bias”, etc.) that drive polarization. Part 2 is a normative interpretation of those mechanisms — in particular, the claim that they are irrational.Part 1 is well-confirmed by a plethora of empirical research. Part 2 is not. In fact, it consists largely of empirical researchers applying over-simplified models of rationality to their data, and concluding that the way people reason in these scenarios is not the way rational people would reason in them.Thus we can accept Part 1 and deny Part 2. That is: we can agree that “confirmation bias,” “motivated reasoning,” and the like are what lead to polarization, and deny that such processes are necessarily irrational. In fact, it turns out that all of these “biases” are to be expected from rational people who care about the truth but face systematically ambiguous evidence.This story of rational polarization is one we can believe. For it allows us to hold onto our political beliefs, since it doesn’t require us to think they are irrational. The catch? We must think that the other side is rational to hold onto their beliefs as well — even though (we think) those beliefs are wrong.Viral Politics in an Age of Hyper-PolarizationNot even pandemics seem capable of dissolving our political differencesarcdigital.mediaSuppose we buy this new, rational story of polarization. What does it imply? Two things.First, it implies that we are in a sort of tragedy: individually rational processes are collectively pulling us apart. That means the way to reduce polarization is not to make individuals more rational consumers of information — they are already doing the best that can be expected. Rather, any successful solution will require changing the structure of our interactions to tamp down on the differential spread of ambiguous and misleading information.Second, it implies that we shouldn’t blame our political opponents for believing as they do. We can — we should — think they are wrong; but we shouldn’t think they are wrong for irrational or biased reasons. Instead, we should think they are doing the best they can with the (mis)information they have.We’re Not Doomed To Be PolarizedA Democrat, a Republican, and a search for common groundarcdigital.mediaThis, I think, should be welcome news. For if we all recognize that the other side is no less rational than our own, that may go some way toward easing the inter-party demonization that is the true tragedy of American polarization.Arc DigitalThe internet’s best opinion pageFollow569 24 PoliticsPolarizationPolitical SciencePsychologyPhilosophy569 claps569 claps24 responsesWritten byKevin DorstFollowPhilosopher at Oxford working on the question of how irrational we truly are.FollowArc DigitalFollowThe internet’s best opinion pageFollowWritten byKevin DorstFollowPhilosopher at Oxford working on the question of how irrational we truly are.Arc DigitalFollowThe internet’s best opinion pageMore From MediumThis Is Fine.

Small changes in survey scales can matter when measuring political ideology in Europe,https://medium.com/pew-research-center-decoded/small-changes-in-survey-scales-can-matter-when-measuring-political-ideology-in-europe-4a10d9a015c5?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Polling,Surveys,Survey Research,Research Methods,Political Science","(Pew Research Center illustration/Wee People)(Related post: On a scale from 1 to 10, how much do the numbers used in survey scales really matter?)At Pew Research Center, survey questions about respondents’ political ideology are among the most important measures in our comparative, cross-national surveys. Our recent research in Europe, for instance, explored how political polarization in the region shapes long-standing debates about domestic, social and economic policies.To measure political ideology, our international questionnaires typically ask respondents to place themselves on a 7-point scale with two labeled endpoints (or anchors) — “extreme left” and “extreme right” — along with numbers for all of the points in between. However, some research suggests that it’s easier for respondents to understand a fully labeled scale, one that includes descriptions for the interior points as well, such as “leaning left,” “leaning right,” or “center.” In this post, we’ll describe a survey experiment we conducted to find out if two approaches to measuring the same concept align with — or diverge from — each other.Findings at a glanceOur survey experiment was part of nationally representative telephone surveys we fielded in France, Spain and the United Kingdom in the spring of 2018. (You can read about an earlier experiment related to survey scales in this Decoded post.)The 2018 surveys asked about political ideology in two ways. First, midway through each interview, respondents were asked the Center’s standard ideology question using a 7-point numeric response scale with only the endpoints labeled. Then, after several more questions, respondents were asked to describe themselves using a fully labeled, 5-point scale.Here are some of the trends we observed across all three countries:· The most common response option for both scales was the midpoint, though a greater share of respondents chose the midpoint on the 7-point scale (“3”) than on the 5-point scale (“center”).· More respondents identified as right of center on the 7-point scale but left of center on the 5-point scale.· Respondents were more likely to choose the endpoints on the 5-point scale than on the 7-point scale, and this was especially true for those on the ideological left.· Levels of item nonresponse (either “don’t know” or refusal to answer) were similar using both approaches.A closer look at France using Sankey diagramsThese aggregate numbers don’t tell the whole story. Fortunately, we can go a step further with our experimental data. By asking all respondents to answer both versions of our ideology question, we can also see how each respondent answered — or “moved” — from one question to the other.To illustrate these patterns, we created Sankey diagrams for each country using the R package ggalluvial. These graphs are a type of flow diagram that illustrate the movement from one category to the next — in this case, from the 7-point scale to the 5-point version. The band thickness in Sankey diagrams indicates the number of people taking a particular path, with thicker bands showing the more common pathways between two points on our different scales. (We should note at the outset that this part of our analysis does not include respondents who answered “don’t know” or refused to respond. It is limited to the 2,625 respondents who answered both ideology questions, including 846 in France, 935 in Spain and 844 in the UK.)In the graph on the left, we’ll focus on French respondents who answered “0 — Extreme left” on the ideology question using the 7-point scale. Of the 55 French respondents who reported “0 — Extreme left,” most of them (31) chose “left” when later asked to identify their political ideology using the 5-point scale. These respondents are represented by the highlighted horizontal line straight across the top of the chart.But what about the 24 other people in France who chose the “0 — Extreme left” option? These respondents are represented by three narrower bands that start at “0 — Extreme left” and then slide down and to the right in the chart. Overall, most of these respondents (18) chose “leaning left.” Far fewer moved to “center” (five respondents) or “right” (one respondent). None of the respondents who answered “0 — Extreme left” on the 7-point scale reported “leaning right” on the 5-point scale.The full range of patterns between the two scales in France is provided in the next Sankey diagram, with the path of each combination of responses illustrated by a different color.A few trends emerge in this graph:· About half of the respondents (53%) who selected the midpoint on the 7-point scale also chose “center” on the 5-point scale, as illustrated by the thickest yellow band connecting “3” to “center.” Among those who chose the midpoint on the 7-point scale but did not choose “center” on the 5-point scale, roughly twice as many placed themselves left of center than right of center: 31% versus 17%.· Nine-in-ten (90%) of those on the left of the 7-point scale identified as left of center on the 5-point scale as well, as illustrated by nearly all of the blue bands above the midpoint moving to either “left” or “leaning left.” Overall, 7% of those who characterized their ideology as left of center on the 7-point scale moved to “center” on the 5-point scale, while 3% moved to “leaning right” or “right.”· Around two-thirds of respondents (66%) who placed themselves on the right of the 7-point scale also chose “right” or “leaning right” on the 5-point scale. Surprisingly, more of those who identified as right of center on the 7-point scale identified as “left” or “leaning left” on the 5-point scale (21%) than moved to the center (13%). This is shown by the similarly sized orange and red paths heading to “left,” “leaning left,” and “center.”· Of the 35 possible response combinations between questions, no respondents in France answered “0 — Extreme left” on the 7-point scale and later identified as “leaning right” on the 5-point scale, or answered “1” and then identified as “center” or “leaning right.”Cross-national results from the experimentSankey diagrams can also be helpful to illustrate and better understand cross-national patterns in our three selected countries. As the next chart shows, several of the broad trends we observed in France are apparent in Spain and the UK as well:Here’s a closer look at what’s happening in this chart:· Across all three countries, most respondents who chose the midpoint on the 7-point scale also chose “center” on the 5-point scale (53% in France, 52% in Spain and 59% in the UK). And just as in France, more people moved from the midpoint of the 7-point scale to left of center on the 5-point scale than moved to the right on the 5-point scale.· In all three countries, the overwhelming majority of those who placed themselves on the left of the 7-point scale also identified as left of center on the 5-point scale (90% in France, 94% in Spain and 89% in the UK).· There is more variability among those who placed themselves on the right of the 7-point scale. While 66% of those on the ideological right in France also placed themselves on the right of the 5-point scale, the share who did so was lower in both Spain (52%) and the UK (61%). Respondents on the ideological right of the 7-point scale in Spain and the UK were more likely than their counterparts in France to move to the center on the 5-point scale (26% in Spain and 25% in the UK versus 13% in France).· As was the case in France, a few combinations of responses were not found in Spain and the UK. No respondents in Spain answered “0 — Extreme left” and then “center” or “leaning right,” or, in another combination, “1” and then a right-of-center response. Similarly, in the UK, no respondents first answered “0 — Extreme left” or “1” and then “right.”As illustrated in the Sankey diagrams, there is general ideological consistency at the individual respondent level between the two survey questions, with only a limited share of people in each country providing apparently contradictory answers. In fact, only 11 of our 2,625 respondents provided the opposite extremes to the two scales (“0-Extreme left” and right or “6-Extreme right” and left). The robustness of these measures across countries suggests that both items can be useful in estimating political ideology. Across countries, our respondents behaved similarly, but not exactly the same. This is reflected in the subtle variability in responses to these two questions that are seemingly measuring the same thing.Concluding thoughtsBoth scales have benefits. A 5-point, fully labeled scale allows respondents to identify with a qualitative description of their political leaning, while a 7-point, endpoint labeled scale provides respondents with more choices to select a position closest to their political ideology. While the two survey questions are different in scale size and wording, respondents across countries answered them in similar patterns, giving us confidence in both when conducting cross-country comparisons.There are several caveats, however. The experiment relied on relatively small samples that limited our findings in a few ways. For example, we could not conduct robust analyses across all possible answer combinations because some were too infrequent and others nonexistent. And while some respondents answered with “don’t know” or refused to answer at all, the number of people who did so was relatively small, limiting our ability to draw inferences about this group.Aside from sample size, there are a few other issues we would consider expanding upon in future experiments. For instance, we did not rotate question order to examine whether replying to the first ideology question affected respondents’ answers to the second question or subsequent items. Also, we tested only two response scales, which means we could not assess the merits of other permutations, such as the results of a fully labeled, 7-point scale or a numeric, endpoint-labeled 5-point scale.Finally, the questions we tested weren’t equivalent. The Center’s standard political ideology question includes the words “extreme” (in the 7-point scale itself) and “center” (in the question stem), but this is not the case in the alternative 5-point scale and associated question. Additional experimental conditions — say, keeping the scale length the same but testing different wordings, or vice versa — would allow us to disentangle these effects.To dig deeper, it might be useful to look beyond the survey results. It’s possible some respondents were confused when we asked for their political ideology twice, so one way to explore the issue would be to incorporate cognitive interviewing in future experiments. This may help researchers better understand the meaning of survey questions, including questions that ask about the same underlying concept, from a respondent’s point of view.In the meantime, we plan to use the data from this experiment to further study whether one of these ideology questions is a more accurate or valid measure than the other. Comparing each question with other items asked in our surveys — such as respondents’ political party affiliation or their opinions on highly politicized topics — would provide additional insights, with the help of Sankey diagrams to visualize the results.This post was written by Martha McRoy and Stacy Pancratz.

When Futurism Gets Stuck in the Past,https://medium.com/curious/when-futurism-gets-stuck-in-the-past-6052294ea579?source=tag_archive---------2-----------------------,"Futurism,World Government,Enlightenment,Universalism,Political Science","The western historical imagination has been haunted by the collapse of the Roman Empire, here illustrated by Thomas Cole in his painting “Desolation” (1836) from the series “The Course of Empire”Ever since I first became interested in futurism in the 1970s, and I began to read everything I could find on futurism, I noticed the almost exclusive interest in world government as the political paradigm of futurism, and even at the time I thought it was odd. I still find it odd today, and so I have gone looking for explanations for the political monoculture of futurism. Let me begin with a speculation — nothing that I consider to be definitive, but only one possible explanation among many — and after my speculation I will move on to a more analytical understanding of the world government paradigm in futurism.Historical thought in western civilization is haunted by the collapse of the Roman Empire. The Romans expanded their political control over the entirety of the Mediterranean Basin and maintained this universal empire for hundreds of years. If we take Rome from its foundation to its last effective presence at Byzantium, its history can be measured in millennia, like Ancient Egyptian civilization. Western historians always have, in their back of their minds, the cautionary tale of Rome: a single, universal civilization effectively dominating the known world, utterly failing and leaving in its wake confusion, social collapse, conflict, and Balkanization. This cautionary tale is often understood as a moral lesson for our time (cf. Manifest Destiny: Roman and American).No historical narrative that summarizes thousands of years of history into some neat schema could ever be quite true; it is an oversimplification in order to give us a “big picture” view of the trajectory of western civilization, but oversimplifications have their place, side-by-side with soporific detail. Either approach risks alienating some part of the audience, which audience is us, today, inheriting these historical traditions at the same time as we look forward into the future.It is possible that this oversimplified narrative of Roman expansion, overextension, decline, and failure is the source of the idée fixe of world government in futurism. World government is what was effectively lost when the western Roman Empire failed, and western civilization ever since that time can be understood as the conscious or unconscious attempt to recover that lost world government of the Roman imperium. Dante was quite explicit about this in his pamphlet De Monarchia (often translated into English as On World Government).Whether or not the explanation of the world government idée fixe ultimately is to be derived from the western historical imagination being haunted by the specter of Roman collapse, or is due to some other cause, is not ultimately decisive; it may bear upon the question and its eventual resolution, but I do not think it will be decisive. So let us widen our scope and consider three other sources of the intellectual fixation on world government; specifically, let us consider three ideas that loom large in the idea of world government, even if these ideas are not often made explicit:The Political IdeaThe Planetary IdeaThe Universalist IdeaWe will take up each of these in turn.The Political IdeaIf we understand civilization to be a form of social organization, and we understand social organization to be intrinsically and essentially political, then it follows that civilization is intrinsically and essentially political. In brief, civilization is a political phenomenon. And one can further conclude that, when the scattered and diverse civilizations of our homeworld began to grow together in a planetary concrescence, because the world entire is settled and populated, then the emergent planetary civilization, being intrinsically and essentially political, should also be converging on a common planetary political framework. The scattered and diverse political structures of the once numerous civilization of our world would, it seems, also grow together into a planetary concrescence of political institutions.If, on the other hand, one denies that civilization is intrinsically and essentially political, then the growing together of civilizations originally separate does not necessarily entail the growing together of political regimes originally separate. Civililzation may become planetary (arguably, it is already planetary at this time), but since civilization is not intrinsically or essentially political, the planetary scale of civilization does not entail planetary scale political institutions.The relationship of civilization to political order is a complex one, so that one might argue either side of the question and be able to produce historical examples of either the coincidence of civilization and political order, or the divergence of civilization and political order. Clearly, one of the emergent properties of civilization has been the emergence of sophisticated political institutions. This has been necessary because civilizations join together a far larger number of individuals than can be found in a nomadic band of hunter-gatherers, a tribe, or a clan, which usually increase to the number of individuals with whom stable social relationships are possible (known as Dunbar’s number), and fission thereafter. The institutions of civilization are a “work around” for the limitations imposed by Dunbar’s number.However, emergent political institutions of civilization do not necessarily entail top-down unification of peoples in relation to some central authority (and the idea that the unified peoples inhabit a particular geographical territory is a later artifact of the territorial principle in law, which more or less corresponds with the origins of the nation-state). One of the most familiar forms that civilization takes is that of a network of cities bound in relationships of cooperation, competition, and conflict with one another (I call this my pragmatic definition of civilization), all cities of which network share in a common civilization, but not a common government. We find this pattern among the cities of ancient Mesopotamia, swept now into one empire, and then later into another, and we find the same pattern among the Mayan cities of ancient Mesoamerica, as well as among the many cities of the Indus Valley civilization, and so on. We understand that when Siyaj Kʼakʼ installed Yax Nuun Ahiin I as king of Tikal in 379 AD that this was a political struggle internal to Mayan civilization and that it does not represent the conquest of one civilization by another.I argue that the identification of civilization with a (single) political regime is reductionist, since civilization is a much more comprehensive conception than that of political order, as seen from rival political orders contending for power within one and the same civilization. That some civilizations have been unified on an imperial basis (e.g., ancient Egypt after the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt about 3100 BC, and China throughout much of its history since Ying Zheng founded the Qin Dynasty after the Warring States period) demonstrates only that imperial unification of one civilization into a single political order is one possibility among many possible political orders that might hold within a given civilization.The Planetary IdeaIn the distant past, when there were far fewer human beings, the size of Earth was sufficient to be effectively indefinite in extent. Small bands of hunter-gatherers could wander for generations, crossing paths with other bands, but with any band able to seek its own uncontested territory if only that band were willing to migrate further than its neighbors. As noted in the above section, nomadic bands fell well within the limits of Dunbar’s number, and as this number was approached by a growing band, that band could fission and the resulting two or more bands would then be free to go their separate ways, maintaining the effective social order.Later, when civilizations began to appear — and even before that when nomadic bands began to settle down into patterns of village agriculture — still Earth was large enough that civilizations could expand to the extent of their ability, sometimes impinging upon other civilizations, but also often without opposition. The remaining nomadic bands would recede further from arable land as the settled agricultural peoples expanded, with the last of the nomadic bands either retreating into the mountains and becoming mountain peoples with a distinctive way of life dictated by this distinctive geography, or becoming pastoralists and eventually horse nomads who learned to raid and to conquer the settled peoples through their mastery of mobile fire.Now the entirety of Earth’s surface has been mapped and claimed and there are no frontiers; all territories are claimed by nation-states, or their administration is agreed upon by nation-states (as with the “Empty Quarter” in the Arabian Peninsula or Antarctica). Territorial expansion is now a zero sum game: one nation-state can expand only at the expense of another nation-state. With Earth being entirely divided up among nation-states, civilization is to be found on every inhabited continent, and many of the institutions of civilization are planetary in scale. The Earth itself is the limit, the natural teleology, of civilization. Or, at least, Earth is the natural teleology of planetary civilization.Having converged upon planetary civilization, the planetary idea presents iself: the natural telos of civilization is understood also to be the natural telos of humanity, of political order, of history, of society, of culture, and of civilization. Earth is entirely a civilized planet; the natural order of things is that the planet entire will slowly converge upon a consolidation of all institutions of planetary scale, including political institutions.Needless to say, this unification of natural teleologies into an overarching planetary teleology is strictly speaking a non sequitur; we have no a priori assurance that the events and activities on Earth are “naturally” limited to Earth and find their fulfillment on Earth. Arguably, we have already imagined elaborate futures for civilization beyond Earth, so that even if human civilization fails to make a spacefaring breakout (or, alternatively, to achieve such an inflection point), we can still conceptualize spacefaring civilization, and if spacefaring civilization is not realized in actuality, it becomes an unfulfilled potential — meaning that the fulfillment represented by planetary civilization does not exhaust the meaning of civilization as it has developed to date.The Universalist IdeaSince the Enlightenment, the idea that there should be universally applicable ideas and institutions, equally valid for all peoples at all times and in all places, has gained the upper hand over a de facto particularism, to the point that one must draw attention to this Enlightenment universalism simply to be aware of its presence as a pervasive influence on our conceptions of political order. Universalism has become like the air we breathe, or the water through which fish swim: it is the unquestioned medium that supports and surrounds everything else that we do.Universalism as applied to political thought holds that there is a uniquely optimal political structure through which human beings can best govern themselves. When Francis Fukuyama asserted in his “The End of History?” essay (1989) that this universal political order was none other than liberal democracy, which had won the Cold War contest and proved itself to be the “last man standing” after a global ideological war, this was, in a sense, the culmination of the Enlightenment trajectory toward a new political system that would replace the feudal hierarchies of the past.It could be argued that the Roman idea of a cosmopolitan order was a pre-Enlightenment conception of political universalism; this may well be true, and, while I do not gainsay this interpretation, I see it in the context of larger developments. The backward-looking character of renaissance humanism, that raised the norms and ideals of classical antiquity as a superior model to that of the otherworldly ideals of the Middle Ages, institutionalized the Roman imperium in the western historical imagination, and it could be argued that the Enlightenment seamlessly took up this idealization of classical antiquity and ran with it in order to create its own norm and ideal of Enlightenment universalism. Enlightenment universalism, then, could be understood as the culmination of a long development in western history evolving from a cosmopolitanian Hellenism of late antiquity to the explicit statement and political formulation of an idealized universal form of civilization.A Retrograde IdealThe idea of world government is backward-looking if we understand it as the attempt to recover the Roman achievement, it is backward-looking if we understand it as a tradition of futurist thought (there are comprehensive articles on world government on Wikipedia and the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, both of which discuss the long intellectual pedigree of the idea), and it is backward looking if world government is simply taken as the default position of futurism, the unquestioned political paradigm of futurism, because futurism has always advocated for world government.It would not be at all difficult for anyone who cared to do so, to investigate the possible permutations of political forms that future civilization might take, with an emphasis upon exploring possibilities that have been neglected in the light of the intellectual fixation on world government. That this has not happened in any kind of systematic way is a glaring weakness in futurist thought. The impoverishment of our political futurism is a reflection of an inability or unwillingness to think critically about political institutions, and especially to think critically about the big picture of political institutions in space and time. One must maintain a cultivated blindness to the complex reality of political institutions, and how they have functioned through history, to maintain unquestioned the idea of world government either as a practical outcome of planetary-scale civilization or as an ideal state of human affairs.This is especially true in relationship to the idea of law. Without studying law one tends to view the institution of law as monolithic, but, in fact, law is anything but monolithic. There are many systems of law employed by many different political entities of overlapping jurisdictions. For one small example, a distinction is made between private international law and public international law, with private international law governing interaction of private individuals from different nation-states, and public international law being a agreed-upon framework within which independent nation-states resolve differences. As war takes place within the framework of public international law, nation-states may choose to resolve their differences through armed conflict and still abide by the provisions of public international law.If one conceptualizes world government as a single system of law for everyone, this idea is so out of touch with the reality of law — its tradition, it formulation, its promulgation, its policing, and its enforcement, all of which involve distinct institutions (the legislature, the executive, police, and courts) — it would be difficult to know where to start in pointing out the flaws in this idea.The Code Napoléon represented an attempt to formulate an Enlightenment universal civil code that prevailed throughout much of the Francophone world, but, significantly, the civil code was not truly universal in so far as it did not also serve as a military code, a criminal code, or a commercial code, each of which sectors had codes distinctive to each aspect of life. A comprehensive code can be cobbled together by joining the codes for distinct sectors of society and the economy, but when a legal code is assembled in this way ex post facto, it will inevitably involve conflicts that need to be rationalized. This was the situation with Roman law when Justinian commissioned the Corpus Iuris Civilis, which was a compendium and synthesis of Roman law that aimed to rationalize hundreds of years of Roman law into a single system of law.The Corpus Iuris Civilis was formulated in Byzantium when Roman civilization had already largely failed in western civilization, so that as European civilization took shape in the aftermath of Roman collapse, it eventually came to draw upon the Corpus Iuris Civilis (which haunted the western historical imagination in law as in other areas of life), but it also drew from the traditions of law among the German tribes (the “barbarians”), as well as eventually from the English common law tradition, which represents the other focal point of legal thought in the western tradition, which is bookended by Roman statutory law and English common law, which latter is a body of case law.This brief sketch of the prolixity of legal traditions within the context of a single civilization could easily be multiplied. Most civilizations have a multiplicity of legal traditions superimposed upon each other over a long history, so that there are many legal codes that can claim to be traditional, and none that can claim to be universal. This is true for all the institutions of civilization, in each and every tradition of civilization; pluralism is the reality that cannot be wished away. Rather than engage in shadowboxing between the reality of a plurality of legal traditions and the monolithic shade of a pretense to universal legal traditions, we should embrace the reality of pluralism and learn to live with it, both at the level of local institutions and at the level of planetary institutions.Taking Politics Seriously in a Planetary ContextI have earlier pointed out that one of the great disconnects in western thought is that between philosophy of law and political philosophy. One would suppose that law is the implementation of politics, and politics the sum total of law, so that these bodies of thought would be related as idea to execution, but in fact we find problems in the philosophy of law being discussed in a conceptual framework that only partially overlaps with political philosophy, and vice versa, so that there is no systematic approach to identifying problems common to both, much less resolving these problems. The philosophy of law in Anglo-American analytical philosophy has become tightly focused on legal positivism, while political philosophy remains mired in the presuppositions implied above that follow from unquestioned Enlightenment universalism.We need to move beyond both the retrograde ideal of planetary governance and the disconnection between legal and political institutions. Taking politics seriously in a planetary context would mean a planetary revaluation of all values (what Nietzsche called Umwertung aller Werte), which in turn would mean a planetary revaluation of law and legal institutions, of politics and political institutions, and overcoming the disconnect between the two. Those who look toward planetary governance as an ideal for humanity have an intellectual responsibility not merely to invoke an empty concept of world governance, but to conduct just such a thorough-going revaluation of legal, political, and civilizational institutions, so that they can offer concrete proposals that transcend the past rather than recreating past follies on a larger scale.This is not something that could be accomplished by one comprehensive book, or by a few books. This would require a multi-generational research project that would benefit from the contribution of the best minds of all the world’s civilizations, spontaneously and willingly cooperating in the enterprise because the idea of planetary ideals and values becomes so compelling that one cannot but dedicate oneself to it. Until such time as such a multi-generational research project comes into being and begins to bear fruit, one should not make the mistake of taking the idea of world governance seriously, as in its current state it is merely the province of dilettantes, who have little of substance on offer. Until then, we are better off investing our time in studying permutations of the nation-state and how it is expressed in the anarchic international state system, since there is at least an extant body of scholarship undergirding this context for planetary affairs.Konstantin Yuon, “New Planet” (1921)CuriousFind out what others have already figured out.

Is beauty really subjective?,https://medium.com/@abhishekyadav8105/the-philosophy-of-beauty-6d516a4e104?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"Philosophy,Philosopher,Beauty,Political,Political Science","Image by: morhamedufmgIs a red rose as beautiful to you as it is to me? Is a messy room beautiful to you? Do you find a hillside sunrise attractive? How do we predispose ourselves to embrace whether “beauty” is universal?From the ancient Greek philosophers like Plato and Aristotle to Shaftesbury, Hume, and Kant, almost all the philosophers have engaged with the questions above. While the meaning of “beauty” has been contended on various premises like aesthetics vs. ethics, love and longing, classical vs. idealist conceptions, I will primarily focus on the objectivity vs. subjectivity of beauty and how different philosophers, through their works, have made a stance in the literary debate.One of the most common narratives or the theory of beauty is whether beauty is subjective- located “in the eye of the beholder.” On the other hand, the objectivity of love, too, is not unheard of or unread of in the philosophical history. In fact, most ancient and medieval accounts, for the most part, located beauty outside of anyone’s particular experiences. However, the subjective narrative of beauty has been commonplace since the time of sophists. By the eighteenth century, Hume could write in his accounts:Beauty is no quality in things themselves: It exists merely in the mind which contemplates them; and each mind perceives a different beauty. One person may even perceive deformity, where another is sensible of beauty; and every individual ought to acquiesce in his own sentiment, without pretending to regulate those of others. (Hume 1757, 136)However, if we base the entire meaning of beauty on the subjective consciousness, the word itself loses all the importance, for we are not communicating anything when we call something beautiful except perhaps a positive personal attitude. Furthermore, although our judgments of things differ, isn’t it incredible how our appraisals coincide with appreciating the beauty of a perfect red rose, or a dramatic sunrise/sunset on a hillside? Any deviation in appreciating the beauty in these cases would often look perverse. Do we find the sunrise/sunset beautiful because they are truly beautiful or because the people around us have collectively and conventionally defined them as beautiful? Such sights do give us some pleasure. However, do we find pleasure in them because they are beautiful, or are they beautiful because we find pleasure in them? Augustine asks explicitly in De Veritate Religione: Are things beautiful because they give delight, or whether they give delight because they are beautiful? He emphatically chooses the second (Augustine, 247). Augustine’s objective explanation of beauty is complemented by the works of Plato and Plotinus in the Symposium and Enneads, respectively. They associate beauty to a response of love and desire but locate beauty itself in the realm of the Forms. Both of them in their works have clearly defined different forms that a “beautiful” object can take.Photo by: M PAlthough Plato and Aristotle disagree in other facets of beauty, they both regard the objectivity of beauty in the sense that it is not localized in the beholder’s response. The classic conception treats beauty as a matter of instantiating definite proportions among parts, sometimes expressed in mathematical ratios, like the “golden section.” One of such illustrations is in the work of Polykleitos. He adopted a specific proportion while sculpting ‘The Canon.’ In ancient philosophy, it is considered that one has to adopt the objective proportion to reproduce any beautiful price of art. Yet, the old convention does attribute some of the normative of beauty to the pleasurable experiences. For instance, Plotinus has:“This is the spirit that Beauty must ever induce: wonderment and a delicious trouble, longing, and love and a trembling that is all delight” (Plotinus 23, [Ennead 1, 3]).While the classic philosophers directed the pleasurable experience as an inadvertent outcome of beauty, the eighteenth-century philosophers regarded pleasure as not an effect but the origin of beauty. This diversion somewhat fueled the subjective narrative of beauty. Locke and other likeminded empiricists treated color (which is an essential locus of beauty), as a ‘phantasm’ of the mind, as a set of qualities dependent on a subjective response, located in the perceiving mind rather than of the world outside the mind. Without the perceivers, in this case, the beauty of an object would diminish in value. This was significantly substantiated by the argument that the beauty of a hillside sunrise/sunset is of no value for a blind person. Even the beauty of a specific object can change when viewed in the daytime or at night. Such variations are conspicuous in experiences of beauty as well.While the ancient and medieval works of literature often tend to make polarized arguments while defining beauty, the relatively modern literature often opt for a marriage of both the art and the philosophy of beauty. They appreciate both the objectivity and the subjectivity of it. For instance, G.E. Moore writes:“To say that a thing is beautiful is to say, not indeed that it is itself good, but that it is a necessary element in something which is: to prove that a thing is truly beautiful is to prove that a whole, to which it bears a particular relation as a part, is truly good” (Moore 1903, 201).Moore tries to explain the importance of the situation in which the object and the person experiencing are both ingrained. In line with the similar thought, Crispin Startwell, in his book Six Names of Beauty (2004), attributes beauty neither exclusively to the object nor the observer. He argues the beauty that we assign to the night sky is not solely because of the pleasure we derive from it. The presence of the night sky itself is pivotal in the creation of beauty. On the contrary, beauty would lose all its value in the absence of the perceiver. Hence, beauty is not merely created in the eyes of the beholder, nor is it inherently a characteristic of the object; the beauty is created through the juxtaposition and connection of the perceiver and the object.Please let me know your thoughts and feedback through comments!

It is I, the illustrious Fyre Monke, destroyer of worlds, patron saint of lost causes, the chaos-bringer, lover of anarchy and justice, ardent supporter of those who struggle in the streets against tyranny. Also ardent supporter of those who struggle in the street against inconvenience. Alright, ardent supporter of people struggling in the streets for just about anything as long they’re not assholes or fascists. Well, sometimes assholes too, but that depends highly on context. Here, take my card.JC: Wow, you really wrote all that on a card…is that a picture of the Monkey King Sun Wukong on the back? I thought….FM: Look, let’s not get caught up in details. I believe you had some questions about policy and social issues?JC: Right, yes, let’s get to it. 2019 was a year of record civil unrest, and 2020 is following in that path. Some experts…FM: YES! IT’S BEAUTIFUL!JC: Err…did you just shoot flames out of your eyes?FM: Of course not, Please continue.JC: Some experts predict that 2021 will be even more fraught with social uprisings as the impacts of COVID-19 become more apparent and nations lift preventative lockdown measures. What do you think can be done to help prevent widespread unrest?FM: I’m sorry I don’t understand the question.JC: …FM:…JC:…FM: These roasted plantains are quite good. Thank you for inviting me here today.JC: Right. Next question. A global rise in populism and widespread growth of both conspiracy theories and disinformation networks have been an important topic of conversation in culture and media lately. Do you see this as a widespread problem preventing the encouragement and development of democracy in global society?FM: No.JC: I’m sorry, can you elaborate? Why not?FM: Look, information, dis-information, what’s the difference really when we get down to the bottom of the issue? I’m not concerned about “facts” and all this ‘blah blah blah’ you windbag journalists are always going on about. Democracy is simple, you smash the tyrannical hierarchy and then you let people live their lives. The details will sort themselves out.JC: Ah ok, so you would consider yourself a minarchist then?FM: Hell no. Labels and teams are for only suckers and windbags like you. I focus on the important bit, liberation and the creation of truly free peoples. Does this cafe serve tea?JC: Just herbal tea.FM: Perfect, i don’t believe in the existence of proper tea anyway. It’s a construct of an unjust society. Mind if I order a cup? You said you’re picking up the tab, no? I don’t carry money. I find it to be annoying.JC: Yes, of course, please. What would you say to people who posit that as these global social movements emerge and create connections and communications networks between one-another, forming what some refer and transnational solidarity, it becomes harder for States to to discredit them or lie about conditions on the ground?FM: Look, computers seem neat. They make cool glowy images and I quite like pornography, but technology is just silly toys humans made to feel better about themselves if you take a step back and really look at it. I mean, don’t get me wrong, there are some exceptions- fireworks for example, I like fireworks. And really really fast spaceships seem pretty neat. It would be cool to burn shit down on Mars. I would like to do that someday.What’s important here is smashing the tyrannical hierarchy. It’s like the people who are always telling me to read Peter Alex CroBumpkin..JC: I’m sorry do you mean Pyotr Alexeyevich Kropotkin?FM: That’s what I said, yes. anyway. All this “theory” is just rules, man. I dislike rules. I get to like page two and I want to reply, Sir, have you even considered burning shit down? I consider myself a monkey of action. You humans talk too much. More flame, less lame, that’s what I always say.JC: Fair enough. Final question: do you think it’s possible to solve the problem of scarcity inherent in market-based economies, or do you think that a better solution would be to try and build a society more focused on people than capital, and a follow-up. Do you think that hierarchies will still naturally emerge even in a stateless society?FM: OH MY GOD YOU’RE SO BORING! This is why you don’t have a girlfriend. Look, Joshua. Burn shit down. Just burn shit down. It’s simple. Freedom. Action. Anyway thanks for the chat, I have to get going though. I have a tindr date with a cute “mona” here in Bogota this evening.Luck with your boring ‘blah blah blah’ article. Chao!Joshua Collins is a freelance journalist and photographer based in Colombia.

Do Leftists Want Joe Biden to Lose?,https://medium.com/discourse/do-leftists-want-joe-biden-to-lose-756bf33f15e6?source=tag_archive---------5-----------------------,"Politics,Government,History,Political Science,2020 Presidential Race","Kyle Kylanski is arguably the most influential leftist with millions of followers between Twitter and YouTube.When it comes to current events, many leftist arguments originate with him. One of Kyle Kylanski’s central arguments is that he will not vote for Joe Biden because Joe Biden doesn’t support at least one-of-his-top-five-positions: “Medicare for All, free college, living wage, ending the wars, and UBI.” If Joe Biden supported one of those positions then Kyle Kylanski said he’d vote for him in 2020.Kyle Kylanski’s view is that he doesn’t want to keep rewarding the Democratic party with his vote because it signals to the party that they can continue to ignore leftist demands while taking leftist support for granted.But what is better? If Joe Biden gave 10%, 10%, 10%, 10%, 100% on each of those positions, or if he gave 50%, 50%, 50%, 50%, 50%?With the latter, leftists are getting more of their agenda through even though Joe Biden fails their ideological purity test on each issue.The truth is that Joe Biden is overall the most leftist Democratic nominee in American history with a running mate who has a Senate voting record further left than Bernie Sanders therefore many centrist Democrats believe they have moved far enough left to satisfy the leftist wing of the party.After all, some of the things Biden/Harris are running on are a $15 minimum wage, free public college for families making under $125,000, a universal housing voucher program, a public option, a $2 trillion dollar green energy plan, a $775 billion plan for caregiving, and a $700 billion “made in America” plan. Biden’s plans come to at least $10 trillion, which is three times the cost of what Hillary Clinton proposed in 2016.“You know what, Joe Biden will become the most progressive president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt. And that, in this moment, is what we need.” — Bernie SandersBut a lot of leftists who are persuaded by that platform still won’t vote for Joe Biden, somewhat paradoxically to Kyle Kylanski’s desire, because they feel he compromises too much!It’s not good enough he holds those positions today he should have held them 10 years ago! This is why even if Joe Biden did support Medicare-for-All there are still many on the left who wouldn’t vote for him because they don’t think he’d actually fight for it. I think this is a fair critique given that in Joe Biden’s previous presidential runs and throughout his long Senatorial career he was known more of as a centrist bipartisan backslapper by supporting such policies as a federal spending freeze and a balanced budget amendment.Ultimately, many leftists believe time is on their side.If Joe Biden wins in 2020 he’ll either seek reelection or have VP Kamala Harris take the ball from there, which could arguably stall the leftist agenda, but if Joe Biden loses then not only will it be easier for democratic socialists to get the nomination in 2024, but it’ll also be easier for them to win the presidency as it is the political norm for the country to change parties in the White House after 8 years.And not only that, but after 8 years of Trump and a more diverse electorate, leftists could be set for a landslide victory in 2024 and be able to push much more of their agenda through in a way that could be difficult with a non-democratic-socialist in the White House and a more evenly divided Senate.From a leftist perspective wouldn’t it, therefore, be better to wait until 2024 instead of Joe Biden making marginal gains now? During radical times, moderate success can be a liability. If Joe Biden wins, Republicans will be in a better position in 2024 to run the “change” candidate, i.e. somebody whose younger, more charismatic, more ideologically-pure, more ethnic, and more anti-establishment, such as the increasingly popular 2016 Republican runner-up Ted Cruz who currently has the #1 podcast in the country.Of course, it’s a big gamble to bet on 2024 (even for disillusioned conservatives in the reverse case) because if 2016 has taught us anything it’s that a lot can happen from now till then.And so although many leftists are not actively cheerleading for Trump to win in order to create their dream 2024 scenario because there are so many ways that Machevillian strategy could backfire it’s enough of a hope for many leftists to keep their pom poms at home.Dialogue & DiscourseNews and ideas worthy of discourse.Follow194 6 PoliticsGovernmentHistoryPolitical Science2020 Presidential Race194 claps194 claps6 responsesWritten byAnthony GalliFollowsocio-political polemic and essayist | www.AnthonyGalli.comFollowDialogue & DiscourseFollowNews and ideas worthy of discourse.

"<strong class=""bz"">MY FIRST NYC VOTER REGISTRATION CASE</strong>",https://medium.com/3streams/my-first-nyc-voter-registration-case-21c142ef938e?source=tag_archive---------6-----------------------,"Voting Rights,Voter Suppression Laws,New York Election,Political Science,Elections","By: KEN SHERRILLToday is National Voter Registration Day.Photo by Elliott Stallion on UnsplashThis reminds me of my first experience as an expert witness at a trial. In the spring of 1969 — my second year at Hunter College in New York City — my colleague Blanche Blank came up to me in the hallway outside the department office and asked me if I did the kind of statistical analysis that could be useful in a voter registration case. I replied that Profs. Don Matthews and Jim Prothro, my University of North Carolina dissertation advisors, had testified in many voter registration cases, usually about barriers to Black registration in the South, and that I thought that I could do the same sort of work. After all, I thought that was something that political scientists routinely did.Blanche told me that a friend of hers, Burt Neuborne of the ACLU National, was working on a case about New York’s bizarre voter registration laws and that he needed someone like me as an expert witness. I was excited by the idea of doing it. I thought it was another rite of passage into being a real political scientist, a part of growing up as a professional.New York’s system at the time was truly bizarre.Anyone who met the age, residency, and literacy test requirements could go to their county Board of Elections — one in each borough in a city of 8,000,000 people — and register to vote until about Labor Day. After that, voter registration took place at local polling places, but only for three days in early October. After that, it was impossible to register to vote. Surely, that system had the effect of depressing the vote, of denying many citizens of their right to vote. I was really excited about having the chance to tear that stupid barrier down.The plan was very simple.All I needed to do was to get each state’s deadline for voter registration and each state’s turnout rate. Then I analyzed the turnout rate in comparison with the number of days between the close of registration and Election Day. That allowed me to estimate the percent of additional voters that came with each additional day of registration. (This was quite a learning experience for me. I had no idea that some states had same-day registration.) Anyway, I computed the percent of voting age citizens who would be added to the rolls if there were no September shutdown and the percent of additional citizens who would be enfranchised if we were to extend voter registration by a week or two.The results were quite substantial.Other than asserting that the state had the power to set the deadlines whenever it wanted, New York’s only defense was that the Board of Elections needed the downtime in order to process the registration forms. Ultimately, the state’s only defense was bureaucratic incompetence. Fortunately, the ACLU had an ace up its sleeve. David Dinkins, who would go on to become Mayor, chaired the New York City Board of Elections and he eloquently testified that the Board would have no difficulty processing the additional registration forms. The judge ruled in our favor and thousands more New Yorkers were registered to vote.Doing this testimony turned out to be much more than a professional rite of passage. Most political scientists never have the experience of using their professional skills to do some real good for the public at large. The thrill that comes from doing this is immeasurable. I went on to do another voter registration case in New York with Burt Neuborne and David Dinkins and I became friends. I went on to work with the ACLU and Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund on LGBTQ rights cases culminating with a Supreme Court victory in Romer v. Evans. Those cases will be the subject of later postings.Addendum on a 1970 failureThe next year, Blanche, Burt, and I were back in federal court to attack another crazy aspect of New York’s election law. At the time, enrolled voters were allowed to cast absentee ballots in the general election but not in nominating primaries.Our plaintiff was a soldier on duty in Vietnam who wanted to vote for Al Lowenstein, who was running for the Democratic congressional nomination as an anti-war candidate against a machine-backed incumbent who was a supporter of the war. I was prepared to testify about why enrolled members of a political party’s right to vote in party primaries were entitled to the same protections as enrolled voters in general elections.The judge may or may not have had any connections to the Brooklyn machine, but he threw the case out and I wasn’t allowed to testify. I haven’t been able to take a “win some/lose some” approach to people being denied their fundamental rights. I think that the issue was resolved by legislative action in later years. If that soldier survived the war, still lived in New York, and still was an enrolled Democrat, he’d be able to vote absentee in Democratic primaries fifty years later.3StreamsA blog about politics, policy, and ideasFollow5 Voting RightsVoter Suppression LawsNew York ElectionPolitical ScienceElections5 claps5 clapsWritten byKenneth SherrillFollowProfessor Emeritus of political science at Hunter College, CUNY and Graduate School, CUNY.

Science,International Relations,Power","在上一篇文中我們稍微透過三個陷阱定律來暸解中國目前的處境和地位，如果還沒有看過的可以點選連結：兩大強權的角力下，臺灣該怎麼做？（上）來觀看。本篇文會聚焦在中美的關係以及臺灣可行的做法來進行探討。Photo by Vladislav Klapin on Unsplash前言近期逢迪士尼電影〈花木蘭〉在臺灣各大電影院上映，其中女主角劉亦菲挺港警的言論頗受爭議，引起社會上紛紛出現抵制觀看〈花木蘭〉的聲音，要與港人站在同一陣線，拒絕中國的大外宣；另外在該片結尾致謝中也出現「中國共產黨新疆維吾爾自治委員會宣傳部門」此極具爭議性的組織，該組織曾被指控對維吾爾族進行強迫勞動和絕育等恐造成族群滅絕和文化消失的手段，更興起了大眾對於中國大外宣的注意和反感，但諷刺的是，目前〈花木蘭〉在台灣的票房已達約3800萬元，票房排名高居世界第二，說明了諸如此類的抵制、拒看等消極性的被動手段，無法有效的阻擋中國的大外宣政策。更不用說年初的總統大選所受到各種網路滲透、攻擊等威脅國家安全的案件層出不窮，以及時常聽到個資洩漏的資安問題，這些有關「資訊」的議題也許是我們現在都應該要有所警覺和提防的，以下我們會進行討論。中美戰爭？直接戰爭？超限戰？Photo by Kevin Ku on Unsplah首先，我想先來探討「資訊」所帶來的影響與威脅。根據中國軍旅作家喬良和人民解放軍空軍大校王湘穗所著的《超限戰》一書，未來的戰爭模式很有可能導向超限戰的局勢。超限戰即意味著超越傳統範圍手段的新型戰爭形式，包括資訊戰、貿易戰、新恐怖主義、科技戰以及生態戰。超限戰是可以透過不流血手段來達到傳統戰爭可以達到的效果，強調「軍事技術」、「科技發展」在未來戰爭的地位是不可取代的。除此之外，喬良也指出「戰爭泛化」是必然的：網路戰、資源戰、媒體戰、金融戰、文化戰等領域都是未來的重點戰場，戰爭範圍已經遠遠超出傳統軍人的能力範疇。這本書不僅精準預測美國九一一攻擊事件的發生，在恐攻發生後掀起一波討論的浪潮，也證實了現在臺灣和美國正面臨到的問題：媒體戰與資訊戰的攻防早就開始。我們把時間拉回到2016年的11月8號，當天正舉辦美國第58屆的總統選舉，並且由共和黨的川普和其搭檔彭斯以306張選舉人票贏過希拉蕊和凱恩的232票，成為美國總統。這樣的結果令美國主流媒體一時之間難以置信，堂堂美國總統竟然是由非典型政治人物出身的川普當選，怎麼會這樣呢？我們再把時間拉到2018年的11月24號，這天是臺灣第7次的直轄市長和縣市長選舉，由國民黨所派出的候選人韓國瑜以89萬票贏下長年綠色執政的高雄市，終結民進黨在高雄20年的連續執政。同樣的非典型政治人物，同樣的贏得了一場出人意表的選戰，也許你會覺得可能就是人民覺得日子過得太苦了，想要換一個做做看；或是這些候選人的口才好，把未來美好願景講得極具吸引力；又或是他們的政策真的略勝其他候選人一籌，但我個人認為，比起上述的幾個理由，這些選戰結果跟選民所接收到的「資訊」有著更深層的連結。為什麼這麼說呢？一個很顯而易見的理由就是：你會每天關注候選人的政見發表或是造勢場合說過的話嗎？當然一定會有些許政治效能感極高的人定期暸解這些候選人的消息，但很明顯的是這種人在社會上並不佔多數，人民更傾向於每天瀏覽社群軟體：臉書、推特、Instagram和各種網路新聞平台，從自己既有的舒適圈和朋友圈中獲取相關消息，需要注意的是，這容易產生在社會心理學上所謂「團體激化」以及「團體迷思」的問題發生，前者意謂著團體討論傾向強化最強勢的意見，使得最後的決定比原本的決定更為偏頗；後者則說明團體內過度在意共識，犧牲了批判思考的精神，這會導致人們對於接收資訊的光譜將越來越窄，越來越難以得到不同觀點的看法，尤其是演算法進步神速，逐漸能夠區分出更細微的團體差異，並投遞更加精確的廣告，讓人們去相信他們所看到的狹小框架內就是社會上的主流趨勢，引發「同溫層效應」。所以真正讓人們去認識和認同某一候選人，我認為多半是靠著社群網絡的媒介來獲取的，這也使得資訊的地位在近年來逐漸提升，並成為各國在軍事上的主要佈局議題。再者，我想針對中美直接戰爭的可能性來進行探討。我認為中美在未來不會有直接且全面性的軍事衝突，其原因可以分為以下四點：第一，地理位置來看，美中為處於太平洋的兩端，兩國在領土、海洋上沒有衝突因子，發生軍事衝突的機率較低，在這邊我們只單純討論國土的問題，不考慮代理人戰爭的情況，兩國在邊界上沒有交集的地區，較不容易產生近期在中印邊界拉達克主權爭議區的「班公錯」（Pangong Tso）南側高地的衝突情況，；第二，由自然資源觀點來看，兩國均屬擁有相當豐富的天然資源蘊藏量，因此兩國較不易因為資源匱乏而產生衝突，川普也在競選期間不段強調美國將會致力於開發頁岩油田，確保國家石油穩定提供；第三，根據金德爾伯格（Charles P．Kindleberger）的霸權穩定論一說，霸權的運作必須建立在提供霸權公共財之上，包含提供開放市場、長期借貸、維持匯率穩定以及確保世界總體經濟政策協調，若無法維持這些共同利益，則此霸權將衰弱而被另一興起的霸權取代之。根據〈2049百年馬拉松：中國稱霸全球的祕密戰略〉一書中可以得知中國顯然有心於成為繼美國之後的另一霸權，但由人民幣在世界的流通率仍遠低於美國可見，中國目前要能夠持續提供霸權公共財的能力還有待商榷。因此在整體經濟實力超越美國時，中國取代美國霸權的地位才較有勝算，但目前看來原本就已經脆弱的中國經濟體加上新冠肺炎疫情的肆虐，此一前景在短期之內應該無法看見；第四，各國的武器科技越發先進、致命，在中美皆有核彈頭的處境下，承襲了冷戰以來相互毀滅保證的嚇阻效果，避免雙方在軍事上的輕舉妄動。綜合上述四個理由，我認為在中美爆發直接戰爭的可能性在近期內還是偏低的。然而這並不代表中美兩大世界強權就不會有所較勁，自2018年起的中美貿易戰就可以很明顯地看到兩國在經濟上的斡旋與交火，一直到近期世界衛生組織在疫情處理的失職引起川普不滿並宣布將停止世衛組織的金援，中國旋即跳出來表示將承接資金的援助，同樣也能看到兩國在國際組織地位上的爭奪戰。我們再將鏡頭拉到這兩個月來臺海的緊張情勢，共軍9月10號在西南海域舉行聯合軍演，並遭到臺灣軍方指控其軍機多次跨越西南防空識別區的界線，具有挑性意味且威脅臺灣安全；而美國艦隊在南海也集結了強大軍力，在今年6月也進行羅斯福號(USS Theodore Roosevelt CVN-71)及尼米茲號(USS Nimitz CVN-68)雙航母的軍事演習，向中國傳達其在臺海附近的強大實力，具有威懾意義。由此可見臺海或將成為新的代理人戰場也說不定，這是我們在今明兩年需要非常注意的地方。綜合上述，我認為中國與美國的全面性戰爭的機會較低，兩國的主戰場將會轉往超限戰的範疇邁進，尤其是以資訊戰的形式展開機會較大；又或是進行在第三地作戰的代理人戰爭，避免本國國土的直接傷亡。但無可否認的是，中國做為一新興的霸權挑戰者，它對於現今霸權－美國的權力抗衡，在未來仍有許多斡旋和衝突的空間與可能性；又或是中國內部掉入塔西佗陷阱，進而引發轉移注意力戰爭，種種的情況也值得我們更深入的思考。臺灣的因應方式？討論完了中國內部情況以及中美關係後，我們將探討臺灣在具體的因應方式上有什麼做法。臺灣自國民政府遷台以來，一直處於中國和美國兩大強權的關注焦點，現今國內兩大黨也各自被視為兩國在臺灣的代理人：民進黨親美；國民黨親中，而臺灣的民意也粗略可以分為這兩派。在本節我將以三個面向討論臺灣在未來可以因應的方式：分別為「中美貿易戰下的戰略調整」、「資訊戰的防禦」以及「外交型態的改變」。（一）中美貿易戰下的戰略調整2019年底，聯合國在11月5日公布一研究報告，提到了中美貿易戰下臺灣是最大受益者，因為美國從中國減少進口的350億美元的產品，其中210億被臺灣、墨西哥、歐盟等國家的出口所替代，可以看出台灣的產業在國際具有極高的競爭力，尤以7月時英特爾宣布採取其他廠商的晶圓消息一出，台積電的股價隨即亮燈漲停，說明臺積電在世界晶圓製造與研發的地位向上攀升，但在中美貿易戰情勢尚未明朗之時，加上新冠肺炎疫情重挫世界經濟，引起全球經濟的不確定性，臺灣可以有以下幾點的策略參考：第一，政府應該更加留意新台幣匯率的穩定，讓臺灣中小型企業能夠有效降低出口的匯率損失風險，畢竟臺灣仍是屬於中小型企業較多的國家；第二，政府應該協助業者強化以臺灣為核心的全球佈局，提供臺商回流的獎勵機制，穩固臺灣在科技產業的地位；第三，政府應結合新南向政策，鼓勵業者增加與東南亞市場的連結和合作，經營東亞產業鍊；第四，政府可提供優良的國內投資環境和法令規範，吸引海外臺商和外國產業對臺投資。（二）資訊戰的防禦資訊戰屬於混合戰（Hybrid war）的一環，其特色在於難以被歸責或追究，行動者傾向採取難以取證，或是刻意混淆的手法，目的是為了被追究時方便否認，具有「易否性」（Plausible Deniability）。從俄羅斯運用混合戰攻下克里米亞，以及俄羅斯介入美國大選，分裂美國社會等事件看出資訊戰的威力甚於以往的常規戰。中國也同樣運用其大外宣政策，利用武器化的公關戰攻擊臺灣今年年初的總統選舉，許多中國公司會利用社交網站和收購的媒體，即所謂的內容農場，進行一次又一次的炒作與散播，逐步改變群眾的看法，甚至有新聞媒體高調宣傳和平統一。臺灣正處在中國資訊戰的最前線，我國應正視資訊戰的問題，更積極地採取防禦措施和反攻之道，以下三點策略可供參考：一、詳盡研究資訊的流通，建立數位鑑識系統，釐清對方攻擊的策略和戰術；二、強化民眾資安意識，加強相關法規，保護個人隱私資料不被竊取；三、強化人民的媒體識讀能力，深化民主人權思維，養成思辨與查證的能力，這是最為長遠的目標，但卻也是最重要的，因為中國資訊戰並不會停止，我們必須要學會分辨真假消息的能力，才不會被風向帶著走。（三）外交型態的改變適逢新冠肺炎疫情的衝擊，讓臺灣完善的醫療體系以及優秀的防疫成績被世界所關注，許多國家紛紛效仿臺灣在抗疫上的作法，我國也順勢推行口罩外交，並分享防疫經驗，與世界各國合作促進全人類的健康安全。除了在抗疫上臺灣受到國際媒體關注，使得加入世界衛生組織的議題有英、美、德、法、日等國支持，重新進入國際組織的目標變得較為明朗時，我們仍應該放眼未來，積極建立國與國之間的關係，強化國家安全。目前的可行方法有二：一為「數位外交」，透過社群媒體的倡議活動，替臺灣和不同國家的人民搭起友誼的橋樑，屬於公民外交的一種；第二，巧外交（Smart Diplomacy），跳脫傳統外交「國與國」的思維，以更包容性的國際合作發展思維，整合外交、教育、科技、經貿、醫療與人權等各部會資源，以及結合官方與民間資源，針對不同開發中國家需求，量身打造跨部門合作的國際發展策略，才能使臺灣擺脫外交困境，創造以人為本的自由民主價值，成為全人類發展過程的重要角色。總結最近國際事件頻傳，很多與臺灣息息相關的事件我們都應該多加關注，然而我認為臺灣目前的主流媒體對於國際世界的著墨並不多，國人不容易接收到相關資訊，在社會上的討論度也不高，這是相當危險也相當可惜的事，身為長期與中美雙方保持高度的經濟合作，並面對中國武力威脅的第一線國家，如何認知到臺灣在國際的地位並保護自己是很重要的，我們並不如以色列具有非常強烈的民族意識和對美影響力，這也使得如何發揮臺灣的長處贏得國際認同顯得更為重要，這也是我在寫文章搜集資料時希望可以去暸解的，強迫自己透過國際事件來認識臺灣，如果我們自己都不願意認識自己生長的土地，不願意去認同我們的國家，那你還期望誰會來認同呢？總結來說，我認為認知到臺灣在國際的地位和長處，並與國際接軌，是我們必須要做的事，不應該一直處於被動的地位，被其他國家牽著鼻子走，不論是親中或是親美都一定各有優劣，完全認知自己的國家才能有一個較為宏觀的判斷；才不會因為兩黨的執政輪替導致對外政策不斷改變、移轉；才能有一個能夠走得長遠的路，也因為這樣才有機會找到我們真正的定位。如果有任何問題或是不完善的地方也請讀到這裡的大家不吝給予指教，希望未來在寫作上可以持續的進步！參考文獻臺灣國際合作發展概念書－台灣海外援助發展聯盟倡議（林子倫，2016）霸權穩定論與歐巴馬政府的亞太戰略發展（賴榮偉，2013）臺灣面臨新型態資訊戰，不僅是「網軍」那麼簡單（林雨蒼，2019）資訊戰，然後呢？《台灣產業因應之道》美中貿易戰對台灣產業的影響與機會《操弄：劍橋分析事件大揭祕》：身為歐巴馬鐵粉，我卻掌握了川普新帝國的鑰匙「劍橋分析」事件是什麼？一文搞懂免費心理測驗背後的故事班公錯肉搏戰：印中邊境二度衝突，印度軍「藏族流亡戰士」陣亡Written

We know Trump is racist. But can we empirically prove it?,https://medium.com/@batadaisy/we-know-trump-is-racist-but-can-we-empirically-prove-it-8d92992cabf0?source=tag_archive---------8-----------------------,"Trump,Racism,Twitter,Political Science,Discourse Analysis","Trump’s Racist Twitter: A discourse analysis of the construction of the ‘dangerous’ immigrant and Trump as America’s saviour“In moments of crisis, people are willing to hand over great deals of power to anyone who claims to have a magic cure.” — Naomi Klein, The Shock DoctrineThe North American relationship with immigration has never been an easy one. Founded by immigrants and built by slaves, public discourse on immigration has always lent itself to a more conservative angle. There has always been a steady stream of migration in and out of the U.S., from all over the world, but from the 1960s onwards that number has been enlarging, with what is sometimes referred to as increased ‘browning’ of society, referring to more migration from Asia, Africa and the Middle East, in contrast to the White of European-Christian cultural heritage majority of the country. In the 2016 election, immigration had somehow taken a large role in Republican nominee’s campaigns. Whether through blatant xenophobic language (“they’re rapists”, Presidential Announcement speech June 16th, 2015) or veiled metaphorical constructions (“some, I assume, are good people”, ibid.), the successful Republican nominee Donald J. Trump put anti-immigration rhetoric, and his ‘Border Wall’, centre stage.Trump’s Border Wall was first mentioned in his Presidential announcement speech as a way to stop what he posited as immigrants “flooding” into the country on the southern border between the U.S. and Mexico. And when he was elected President, many of his most controversial policies were related to immigration. The administration, for example, has been criticised for Executive Order 13769, titled Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States, commonly dubbed as the ‘Muslim Ban’, in which countries of majority Muslim populations were temporarily banned from entering the U.S. Family separations on the border have been widely criticised, as have Trump supporters, who chanted “send her back” (July 17th, 2019, Greenville, North Carolina) in response to Trump’s ongoing conflict with Ilhan Omar, the first Muslim-identifying congresswoman of Minnesota’s fifth district.In his Presidential Announcement speech on June 16th, 2015, Trump conflated immigration with criminality, saying that “when Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best […] They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. […] It’s coming from more than Mexico. It’s coming from all over South and Latin America, and it’s coming probably — probably — from the Middle East.” And from that day on has persisted with a narrative that immigration (specifically from “shithole countries” (Dawsey, 2018)) poses an immediate danger to the lives and livelihoods of Americans.Populism, a shift in the Overton Window, a rise in the ‘alt-right’ or a reaction to the Obama Presidency are all spurious elements in the relationship between the Trump administration and anti-immigrant policies. Trump, like other Presidents before him, has stoked uncertainty, fear and anxiety around immigration through his rhetoric. This research analyses how Trump uses anti-immigrant discourse on Trump’s Twitter feed, @realDonaldTrump, to answer the question of why he might do so. It looks at instances of inflammatory language with words such as ‘aliens’, ‘anchor babies’ and ‘illegals’, and metaphorical constructions of instances of fear-mongering and constructions of immigration as a threat to an American way of life, in conjunction with the construction of Trump as the only person willing and/or able to address this (unproven) crisis.Trump has existed within the public eye throughout most of his life. In 1971 he took over the family’s real estate business, re-naming it The Trump Organisation, and subsequently produced several televised beauty pageants and became best known for his book The Art of the Deal and hosting reality tv show The Apprentice. He is the sole President to have reached office without first serving either in any public office or in the military, but was instead a celebrity before his inauguration, making his relationship to social media and to the public a particularly unique phenomenon to investigate.Twitter presents a unique angle on Trump’s rhetoric, as expanded upon in the Literature Review: his tweets seem to be unfiltered by speech writers, coming directly from him; tweets force the user to be concise, being limited to 280 characters (previously 140) and thus allows us to avoid the rambling nature of his speeches and public appearances; they are regularly the subject of extensive news coverage; and Trump is an experienced Twitter user, having posted frequently since joining in 2009. The influence of social media in the 2016 election has since come under intense scrutiny after allegations that Cambridge Analytica harvested the data of over 50 million Facebook users in order to better their marketing research for the Trump Presidential campaign (Rosenberg, Confessore & Cadwalldr, 2018), although the nature of the influence of Twitter on public opinion is still unclear, making research into social media all the more pressing.A dialogue on Trump will always, inevitably, lead to a discussion of populism. It has been found that anger is a significant driver in support for populism (Rico, Guinjoan, Anduiza, 2016). Populism has also been found to define national identity by a process of negation, naming a threat (recently more frequently immigration) or what is wrong with those outside of the ideology, forming sovereign identity on the determination that ‘we’ are not like ‘them’ (Gimenez & Schwartz, 2016). This research investigates whether Trump harnesses anger and anxiety in combination with the creation of a sovereign homogenous group, toward immigration and ‘outsiders’.It is clear that increasing support for the right globally has had an influence on the discourse of immigration and the nature of nationality and nationalism. What this research hopes to clarify is whether anti-immigrant rhetoric from Trump is solely playing to this trend or if it functions as a catalyst for feelings of insecurity in the electorate, reinforcing the ‘need’ for harsher immigration control and thus a candidate or President willing to implement it.Trump’s tweets have been the subject of quantitative scholarly enquiry, but this will be one of the earlier studies of his tweets through discourse and qualitative analysis (Pain & Chen, 2019). Much of the scholarly analysis of Trump’s Twitter has been focussed on the form of the tweets (Gross, 2016; Pain & Chen, 2019; et al.) or predicting voting patterns, opinion and sentiment (Tumasjan et al. 2010). This research finds a carefully constructed and maintained effort to create an adversary in the form of those migrating to America, positioning Trump as “the lone outsider who can save the country” (Pain & Chen, 2019) and deliberately employing positive self-representation and negative other-presentation (Kreis, 2017). Theoretically, we draw on Van Dijk’s method of discourse analysis for the research, and investigate previous research on Twitter in the literature review (Pain & Chen, Hong & Nadler et al.), plus theories of disaster capitalism (Klein) and collective, biological and economic insecurity (Lorey & Butler) in the discussion as to theorising the why of the research question.We start by reviewing research on Twitter’s relationship to democracy, populism and politics in general, in combination with previous research on Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric and the nature of Trump’s Twitter discourse. We also review theories of discourse analysis in relation to social media. We then present the expectations and theories of the research, before mapping the methods used and the results. In the discussion we theorise on the paper’s limitations and possible future avenues, as well as the implications for the research and touch upon theories on the results.1.1 Coded Language on TwitterPrevious scholarly research has been heavily focussed on how Trump has used Twitter in aggressive, clumsy and/or absurd ways (Franck, 2019), whether that is through taunts and tirades (Gross et al., 2016), spelling mistakes such as the infamous “covfefe” incident (@realDonaldTrump, May 31st, 2017, 12:06) or how he consistently ends tweets with an emotive word or phrase, such as “sad!” (@realDonaldTrump, May 7th, 2019, 20:15). Very little scholarly attention has been paid to the theory that Trump may use Twitter more prepensely. The paper thus theorises that initially Trump created an “expert language” (Pain & Chen, 2018) that invited many Americans who felt ignored, shunned or forgotten into his inner circle by ‘speaking’ to them through Twitter.Research using social media is increasingly popular among social scientists (Fiesler, 2019). However, studying information from a social media platform like Twitter comes with methodological and conceptual challenges, such as sampling biases arising or vague or unrepresentative sampling frames, as Zeynep Tufekci notes, “the socio-cultural complexity of user behaviour aimed at algorithmic invisibility (such as subtweeting, mock-retweeting, use of “screen captures” for text, etc.) further complicate interpretation of big data social media.” (Tufekci, 2014, p.1). This, combined with analysis of a public figure whose tweets are frequently posted by campaign or administration staff (and thus cannot be wholly assigned to Trump himself) make quantitative analysis of Twitter complex. Therefore, this research, while using some quantitative analysis in order to extract patters within large sums of data, mainly focusses on a qualitative analysis.Twitter has been instrumental in creating a new kind of discourse — a situation in which users speak not directly to each other (unless through responding to each others tweets on a ‘thread’ or via direct, private messages) but broadcasting their speech to their followers and to the wider world in general — as if someone were standing in the street, announcing their opinions. Users are limited to 280 characters (previously 140) within which they must express themselves. Using the “@“ symbol, users can tag or mention other users, and the “#” symbol creates a link to a thread, so that every mention of the hash-tagged word is connected. The hashtag has been especially prolific in marketing and campaigning, in that it reduces a meme to a bitesize hashtag, already connected to a wider context or discussion. For example, the hashtag #LockHerUp is recognisable as a reference to Trump’s ongoing criticism of the handling of the Hillary Clinton email scandal in which 20,000 documents were hacked from John Podesta, Clinton’s campaign chair (Wikileaks, 2016) and his insistence that she should be in jail, regardless of the assurance by James Comey, former FBI Director, that there had been no criminal act (Yuhas et al., 2016).1.2 Truth, Lies and the TwitterscapeTweets have been found to be a form of “discourse which help to create and reproduce systems of social meaning” (Fran Tonkiss, 1998, p.245). There is, on Twitter and in a wider social context, a social construction of discourse specific to members of social circles. In the same way that youths from London have a different language of slang than youths from Manchester, so do members of political spheres on Twitter. Neo-nazis have developed a coded language online that involves meanings behind the use of symbols, for example using an ‘echo’ or triple parentheses, “((( )))” to draw attention to a Jewish name (Hess, 2016). The paper argues that Trump also creates a system of coded language through his tweets, and that he continues to do so successfully; “Crooked Hillary” for example, is a phrase that has been repeated 334 times on Twitter as of the writing of this paper (TrumpTwitterArchive.com). In regard to this conceptual phrase, it is irrelevant if Hillary Clinton is actually “crooked” — followers understand that the phrase is linked to the narrative that Clinton is too close to Wall Street, and thus the same as every other politician before her, except, supposedly, Trump. Consistently associating Clinton’s name with the concept of being “crooked” thus tries to serve multiple purposes; cementing Trump as a populist, ‘anti-big government’ politician; undermining her credibility; and reinforcing the concept that is, fundamentally, just Trump’s opinion, as a socially accepted truth. It is through the development of a coded system that Trump has created his own expert language, the function of which is threefold: “It marks out a field of knowledge; it confers membership; and it bestows authority” (Tonkiss, 1998, p.247).In 2016 the Rand Corporation published an article titled The Russian “Firehose of Falsehood” Propaganda Model. In it, they theorise that President Vladimir Putin and others use a technique of repeatedly and unashamedly lying to the public in order to convince them that these lies were true. They found that not only did it not matter whether a lie contradicted objective reality, repeating a lie forces the viewer to engage in its existence and thus provide it with validity, reducing the concept of ‘truth’ to opinion. It has been found that subjects attitudes towards the target of a lie got worse even after the lie was debunked (Thorson, 2013) and that a falsehood is considered more ethical to tell if it aligns with the subject’s political preferences (Effron, 2018). Trump is quoted on July 25th, 2018 at the Veterans of Foreign Wars National Convention in Kansas City, Missouri as saying “just remember, what you’re seeing and what you’re reading is not what’s happening. Just stick with us, don’t believe that crap that you’re seeing with these people, the fake news”. This paper thus approaches anti-immigrant rhetoric in Trump’s Twitter with skepticism, choosing to let the numbers indicated by research speak as to the situation of immigration in the U.S. rather than solely information disseminated by the Trump administration.It can be theorised that Trump’s falsehoods serve as a filter for loyalty, interchangeable with a sense of ‘faith’; or that followers blindly trust him; or that they are indifferent to falsehoods as they believe every politician lies. When Trump has targeted something, it does not matter what evidence he uses to back himself up and whether this evidence is in fact debunked — the persistent attitude toward the subject remains the same for his followers (Effron, 2018). In discourse analysis, “language is seen not simply as a neutral medium for communicating information, but as a domain in which our knowledge of the social world is actively shaped.” (Tonkiss, 1998, p.245) It deconstructs language to understand it not as a way to transparently present the truth, but a way to construct and organise social reality, in a manner in which “social identities are formed” (Tonkiss, 1998, p.246). Thus, the analysis of his Twitter feed is not an exercise in fact-checking but rather an exercise in noticing trends and patterns that shape the narrative of focus — immigration. His Twitter feed can be seen as a culmination of all that he says in public; ideas and concepts perhaps taking form as and when he says them, the most pertinent (or those which garner the most applause) being reinforced through tweets.1.3 Twitter, Democracy and TransparencyTwitter can be used as an instrument for increased participation and democracy (Pain & Chen, 2019), but has not thus far been proven to shape public opinion, either positively or negatively (Hong & Nadler, 2011). Whether Twitter is causal or transformative in participatory democracy is still up for debate (Pain & Chen, 2019), and its influence on public feeling (whether it incites or encourages anti-immigrant sentiment, for example) has been hard to study up until the presidency of Trump, in which his tweets are not only consumed by his followers but widely disseminated by the media on both the left and the right (Gross & Johnson, 2016), functioning firstly as free advertising and secondly as news-stories within themselves (Pain & Chen, 2019; Gross & Johnson, 2016; Kreis, 2017).Twitter seems to create a space within which political figures can communicate closely with users, without the middle-woman of the press or media (Kreis, 2019). It has been found that Twitter has been used by Presidents and presidential candidates other than Trump as a means through which to spread information and opinion (Ross & Rivers, 2018) rather than to engage with other users or colleagues.Trump’s use of Twitter has been found to use an informal, direct and provocative style to construct the concept of a homogenous people and homeland threatened by immigration (Kreis, 2017). It allows Trump to appear unfiltered (Pain & Chen, 2019), and it is this idea that is key in understanding Trump’s larger discourse. In line with populist tradition, Trump has bolstered an image of himself as a man of the people (Canovan, 1999), claiming to be a businessman who worked his way to become the most powerful person in the country. Arguably it is his history as a public persona and tv personality that has helped justify alleged efforts to “drain the swamp” (October 17th 2016, Trump campaign press release, since deleted) of the political elite, being the first President who has served neither in public office nor the military before serving as President.His tweets have been found to be mainly conversational; he does not often cite reputable news sources, facts or figures and consistently uses language of “incivility” by consistently writing in capital letters or personally attacking others (Pain & Chen, 2019), with a more personal approach than those of other public officials, up until he announced his candidacy, at which point fellow candidates changed their approaches to reflect his (Gross et al. 2016). His manner on and off social media consistently appeared unfiltered; it seemed clear that he handled his own Twitter rather than campaign staff; he frequently went off script when speaking in public; and repeatedly derides efforts to maintain a professional dialogue, insisting that he doesn’t “have time for total political correctness” (Trump, GOP Primary Debate, Cleveland, August 6th, 2015). It is this last element that is the most divisive — and for which his supporters have the clearest rebuttal. They would rather a candidate or President who was unfiltered, and by implication, trustworthy, than a President who only shows a public image and keeps the rest of their thoughts and actions private. This is not to say that Trump is actually trustworthy, but rather that his unfiltered discourse only serves to reinforce his image of a man of the people and thus outside of the political elites.As much as negative and provocative language may produce results and therefore be considered a conscious strategy by politicians, it is also likely to be a product of intuition and prior experience (Gross & Johnson, 2016). This is where the gap in the literature lies in that campaign tone and discourse on Twitter have previously been treated in scholarly research as explanatory variables rather than investigating the driving factors to use said discourses and/or rhetoric (Gross & Johnson, 2016). This research aims to dissect how Trump uses anti-immigrant discourse on Twitter in order to shed light on why he might do so.1.4 The Good ImmigrantAnti-immigration rhetoric centred on the conflation of immigrant status with criminality has been widely debunked. Incarcerated Immigrants in 2016: Their numbers, demographics and Countries of Origin by Michelangelo Landgrave and Alex Nowrasteh uses American Community Survey data from the U.S. census bureau to analyse incarcerated people and their immigrant or native status. They find evidence that shows immigrant status (whether legal or not) actually reduces the likelihood of criminal behaviour in relation to their share of the population. Nonetheless, it has been theorised that from the moment that Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act that conservative whites have been leaving the Democratic Party (Favreau, 2018) and that politics has become increasingly more racialised, up to and including the Trump administration. Former President Barrack Obama’s campaign and administration was, with the help of Trump, constantly discussed in relation to his race; his father being Muslim, the “birther” theories (as of the writing of this paper Trump had tweeted about Obama’s birth certificate 22 times, TrumpTwitterArchive.com), his middle name being Hussein etc. The majority of white people in the U.S. voted against Obama in both elections (Favreau, 2018) including in blue states like California. It has been theorised then, that racial bigotry has always existed within American politics; but Trump has willingly “poured gasoline” (Favreau, 2018) on an issue that other politicians have avoided. Even so, immigration is repeatedly and consistently conflated with criminality and more than that, the concept of “line-cutting” (Edsall, 2016) in which white Americans feel unjustly neglected for the sake of affirmative action, in which immigrants, women, people of colour and other minorities supposedly jump ahead of them in the queue for the American dream (Inglehart & Norris, 2016), moving voters away from the post-materialist boom post World War II (Inglehart & Norris, 2017) and towards populist politics in favour of nationalism. This paper thus takes anti-immigration discourse to be ill-informed and largely false.2 Research design/MethodologyThis research looked at a total of 11,406 tweets from the Twitter account @realDonaldTrump from the day that Donald Trump announced his candidacy for the Presidency on June 16th, 2015 up until the 16th of August 2019, when this research was closed, as collected by Brendan Brown at TrumpTwitterArchive.com. This included 25 sent from a Blackberry mobile device between June 16th, 2015 and July 11th, 2015; 2,118 from an Android mobile device between June 16th, 2015 and March 25th, 2017; and 11,406 tweets from an iPhone mobile device between June 16th 2015 and August 16th 2019 (see Table 1). These tweets were filtered to removed retweets and direct messages to other users using the “.@“ function, so as to remove potential interference of irrelevant data. It was also important to note that not all tweets can be proven to be written by Trump himself as he has had multiple people in his campaign and administration with access to his account. Thus all tweets from the three main devices he allegedly used were collected to avoid bias by researcher selection, using Twitter metadata, as research has shown that Trump tweeted from his personal Android before the inauguration, with one staffer having access to his account, and moving to a mandated government iPhone after (Rosenberg & Haberman, 2018; Newman, 2017; Feinberg, 2017). It is, however, virtually impossible to know for certain. The dataset used is a combination of the archived tweets from the TrumpTwitterArchive, analysed in Atlas.ti. This archive is used rather than the metadata straight from Twitter as it includes tweets that have later been deleted. It was important in this study to include tweets that were deleted as it most closely reflects Trump’s use of Twitter.First the relevant tweets were imported into Atlas.ti with their corresponding dates and coded as “true” of “false” as to whether they were a retweet. Each tweet was imported as a case. Retweets were then removed from the study, leaving the total of 11,406 (Table 1). All 11,406 tweets were then read manually by the researcher. During this initial reading, common themes were noted, as well as expectations that had been met and those that were incorrect. In the second reading, key words and phrases were noted in relation to the research question.The tweets were then analysed quantitatively. First, tweets were analysed in Atlas.ti as to the most common words. All tweets were then coded with words related to immigration and Trump’s specific language on the topic, as noted in the initial readings. Each of these words was manually and then automatically analysed as to find the highest cooccurring word in relation to it, in order to observe trends. Significant words were then selected from the initial analysis for further exploration.Further tweets that warranted further analysis on an individual basis were noted in the first and second readings of the tweets.Quantitative analysis is useful for counting tweets and finding textual patterns — which words are used in concurrence with words such as ‘immigrant’ or ‘danger’, for example. This must also be reinforced by qualitative analysis of the discourse, to remove researcher bias in qualitative analysis and to avoid missing patterns that may be lost in quantitative analysis. For example, when coding a word such as “illegal”, it was necessary to manually read each code within this group so as to differentiate between tweets referring to illegal immigrants and discourse on Hillary Clinton or the Mueller investigation. By diving the tweets into code groups, it was easier to then separate tweets that were relevant to the research and those that weren’t.It is clear that the researcher will always have bias. The intention of manually reading all 11,406 tweets was to try and remove as much of this bias as possible — for the research to have, to the best of it’s ability, interpreted the data as a whole before moving into the specifics of discourse around immigration.3 Analysis/ResultsIn regard to creating an “expert language” within which subtext is understood from those familiar with Trump’s rhetoric, there were trends. It was found that he often capitalises words within a concept or idea that he wishes to emphasise: for example, “Rigged Witch Hunt” (@realDonaldTrump, August 14, 2018) or “Crooked Hillary” (@realDonaldTrump, Oct 16, 2017). He sometimes capitalises full words or sentences, giving the impression that he is shouting, or emphasising what he is saying — although it is less frequent than expected. A certain style is clearly apparent, and can easily divide tweets into categories, for example, a statement is usually ended with one word that rounds off the sentiment, for example; “sad” which is used 64 times at the end of a tweet, or “bad” which ends a tweet 44 times.It was expected that much of the discourse on Trump’s Twitter feed would be slanderous or critical of his opponents: there was a significant chunk of the tweets that were of this nature, but contrary to expectations the nature of the tweets were more positive than negative. For example, he congratulated others in 258 different tweets. When referring to opponents, his critics or people he simply does not seem to like, he will frequently use derogative language that dehumanised them: “Good work by General Kelly for firing that dog” (@realDonaldTrump, August 14th, 2018). He uses the phrase “Animal Assad” in three tweets (@realDonaldTrump, twice on the 8th April 2018, and once on the third of November 2017).The most frequent use of Twitter for Trump appears to be for gossip or interjection into public discourse. On initial reading it was found that he spent a large portion of time either endorsing or congratulating people, or injecting his own opinion into a public discussion, such as directly tweeting at American television show Fox and Friends; or criticising opponents, whether through personal snipes or prolonged, multi-tweet threads of what essentially appears as ranting. All of this discourse can be catalogued as reactionary tweeting: tweets that respond to perceived successes or failures of his peers and/or responses to news stories about himself. This is the bulk of the discourse on his feed, contrary to our expectations.There is a subtext to most of the discourse on immigration, which is that the rhetoric is in relation to people of colour. This is not explicitly said but through further research it seems to be inherent in the discourse. The majority of the time that Trump is discussing immigration he is either referring to immigrants from Mexico, or (explicitly) Syrians. Occasionally he lets the reader make this connection themselves, by using phrases like “certain people” (12 times in relation to immigration) with a wink and a nod that you know what he means. Trump has denounced implications of racism, for example by tweeting “I am the least racist person” (@realDonaldTrump, August 6th, 2019, 05:57) and yet, announcements of (unproven) statistics on African-American and minority unemployment levels still seemed to sit uneasily within the narrative.We theorised that those tweets referring to African-American and minority unemployment levels reveal a subtext within themselves. At no point does Trump refer to overall unemployment levels in the U.S. — he specifically references unemployment in minorities. Although it is not specifically stated, this can be interpreted as more of a coded discourse than initially apparent; rather than celebrating (again, unproven) lower levels of unemployment, it seems more likely to feed into racial stereotyping — mainly, the deeply offensive and racist misconception that people of colour are unemployed because they are avoiding work. And thus, through this discourse, he is not in actual fact misinforming his followers about false unemployment numbers, but reassuring his followers that he is making people work. This may seem like a bit of a reach — but in the context of other public actions in which he interacts with people of colour, he has repeatedly shown himself to be bigoted (buying the NFL players KFC when they came to the white house; publicly criticising Colin Kaepernick for taking the knee at basketball games to protest police violence; infamously failing to criticise nazi protestors after the death of a protestor in Charlottesville and later saying in a speech that there were “some very fine people on both sides” (Press Conference at Trump Tower on August 15th, 2017); or allegedly referring to countries with majority people of colour as “shithole countries” and implying that the US needed migrants from places such as Norway, a majority white country (Beckwith, 2018)).As expected, the overall tone of the discourse was informal. Trump rarely uses complicated language, although this might just be a reflection of the way he speaks, rather than a conscious choice to appeal to as wide an audience as possible.4.1 Immigration as a direct threatNoticeably references to immigration and anti-immigrant rhetoric were less frequent than expected. Through the initial analysis of keywords it was discovered that mentions of immigration specifically were relatively small. However, when these references were made, there was a clear pattern. Immigration was not tweeted about in a positive light in a single case. It was when looking at the highest cooccurring words (Table 4) that patterns became clearest. 66% of the instances in which “aliens” were mentioned it was in cooccurrence with the word “illegal” and “criminal”. The next most cooccurring words were “border” with a 41% rate, and “violent” with a 12% rate. In not a single tweet that included the word “aliens” was the discourse positive. This trend repeated with the word “immigrant”, with the highest cooccurring word “illegal” at a frequency of 86%, and border at 44%; and with “illegals”, a slang word used in reference to immigrants used 277 times by Trump in the analysis, the highest cooccurrence was with the word “border” with 71% and “Mexico” with 47%. These words and phrases create almost a loop in this analysis, where a mention of one of these key words inevitably led back to another. Rather than the conversation on immigration having a broad range, there is a specific narrative that arises. The narrative groups together most, if not all, immigrants with the label of “illegal” and “aliens”.Analysis of tweets containing the words “immigrant”, “aliens” and “illegals”, can thus all be used almost interchangeably with little difference in surrounding discourse. Immigration is consistently discussed as a large, impending crisis. “Pouring” was frequently used alongside “big flow”, “caravan”, “invaded”, “surge” and “large numbers”. This subtext of an imagined wave or ‘pouring in’ of people was supported by more explicit language, such as “South Carolina needs strength as illegals and Syrians pour in” (@realDonaldTrump, 20th February, 2016, 17:02), and “tens of thousands of illegals are being apprehended (captured)” (@realDonaldTrump, 3rd September, 2019, 22:13). The nature of the immigrants was also made clear — or at least, Trump’s opinion of them. Most noticeably, more than discourse on the economy or alleged “line-cutting” was the implication (or more frequently statement) that immigrants were dangerous: which supports our second hypothesis, Trump’s discourse on Twitter is expected to have positioned immigrants as a direct threat to American citizens. Frequently immigrants were described as “criminal”, “violent”, “dangerous”, “guilty”, “offenders” who were trading in “drugs” and “human trafficking”. Immigrants were accused of being “set free to prey on innocent Americans” (@realDonaldTrump, March 13th, 2018, 10:27); they were frequently accused of committing violent crimes without citation or evidence, for example in one tweet “five people killed in Washington State by a middle eastern immigrant” (@realDonaldTrump, September 25th, 2016, 07:18).It was further suggested that stronger border security (and by extension, less immigration) would “save american lives” (@realDonaldTrump, November 4th, 2016, 01:46), with frequent hyperbole that suggested a “National Emergency at the Southern Border” (@realDonaldTrump, March 17th, 2019, 03:58), or that “this is a public safety crisis” (@realDonaldTrump, April 17th, 2018, 04:34).4.2 Trump as America’s SaviourThere were 32 instances in which he explicitly says that he is the only person capable of solving key issues, two of which were directly related to immigration, “Our southern border is unsecure[sic]. I am the only one that can fix it” (@realDonaldTrump, July 3rd, 2015) and “Such a big problem for our country-I can solve” (@realDonaldTrump, August 26th, 2016); and one which explicitly conflates ISIS and border security, and by proxy, immigration, “5,000 ISIS fighters have infiltrated Europe.Also,many in U.S. I TOLD YOU SO! I alone can fix this problem!” (@realDonaldTrump, March 24th, 2016). An expected and clear narrative that Trump created was a criticism of the handling of immigration from the Obama administration; and the attitudes of Democrats who were allegedly “protecting MS-13 thugs” (@realDonaldTrump, May 26th, 2018). Frequently when he endorsed a fellow Republican it was in the context of their attitudes toward border security, and disparagements of Democrats was consistency in relation to their seemingly poor immigration policies. This leads us to the third hypothesis, Trump is expected to present himself as the only person capable of managing an alleged migrant crisis. Our research found that Trump presents himself as the only person capable of mentioning anything — not just immigration. When referring to himself he frequently uses words such as “best”, “only”, “win” or “winning” and “great”. One particularly insightful tweet reads “Nobody will protect our Nation like Donald J. Trump. Our military will be greatly strengthened and our borders will be strong. Illegals out!” (@realDonaldTrump, March 26th 2016).4.3 America Against the WorldMuch of the analysis tacitly infers results as to the first hypothesis, Trump is likely to create a discourse on the subject of immigration that pits Americans against immigrants in an ‘us’ vs. ‘them’ rhetoric. An ‘us’ vs. ‘them’ narrative is thus more implied than explicit, contrary to what we expected. This may come from the sense that Trump is consistently tweeting to his loyal fanbase and followers — the ‘us’ does not require creating as it is implicit within the narrative. The techniques and language used on Twitter creates the sense that Trump is conversing with his friends; letting you in on the truth, revealing what is ‘really’ happening.In conjunction with this implicit creation of the communal ‘us’ together with Trump, the idea of immigrants as outsiders is a given. Trump does not need to state that immigrants are not ‘like us’ — he knows who his audience is, and his platform from the beginning has been one of othering immigrants and even the ‘dreamers’ or children who were born in the U.S. to immigrant parents. This narrative is thus not as explicitly clear in the research. Although we could reach a conclusion on the narrative of ‘us’ vs. ‘them’, it would be hard to reach without researcher bias interfering with the results. Inferring from the language used does create some expectations, but these are left largely down to the individual’s interpretation.ConclusionsIt has been said that every great President has his war. And if there is no literal war, incumbent Presidents repeatedly have been found to find a new threat to combat in order to project an image of themselves and their administration as necessary in order to combat said threat. Examples include former President Bill Clinton’s “war on drugs” (which disproportionately incarcerated African-American men on petty drug charges), or former President George Bush and former Prime Minister of England Tony Blair’s “war on terror” (in which a desire to control Middle-Eastern oil supplies was hidden under the guise of a threat of nuclear weapons). We can also see examples of this at mid-term elections, dubbed the “October Surprise”, in which public or social ‘surprise’ crises are levied to garner support from opposing prospective or incumbent candidates. Examples of this include the Ebola crisis in 2014; the Clinton email scandal in 2016; the Osama bin Laden tape in 2004; and Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Each of these cases have even cited in Naomi Klein’s theory of “disaster capitalism” (2007). She posits that economic, climate or terrorist crises or threats are exploited by politicians in order to profit from the fear created by such events. This theory can be applied to examples of election scandals that capitalise on fear in the American voters in order to sway their votes directly before an election. Extensive research has been conducted into how crises affect voting patterns and Presidential support, such as Voting After the Bombings: A Natural Experiment on the Effect of Terrorist Attacks on Democratic Elections by Jose G.Montalvo, and Are Voters Sensitive to Terrorism? Direct Evidence from the Israeli Electorate by Claude Berrebi and Estban F Klor.The biggest question that arises from this research is why Trump has such a strong anti-immigrant narrative in his discourse. We draw upon Naomi Klein’s The Shock Doctrine and Isabell Lorey’s State of Insecurity to theorise that Trump creates a sense of insecurity and cultural vulnerability that he then exploits in order to be necessary to the American electorate. If he is the only one talking about a crisis, then by implication he is the only one willing to solve it. He then reinforces the narrative that he can solve this crisis explicitly, whilst positing the concept that he is the most capable. These two books address similar themes; the effects of collective trauma on governance, politics and power.Klein’s work first looks at the effects of shock treatment on the individual. She looks at research undertaken by the CIA in the 1950s that discovered a new form of torture in order to get the subject into a state where they would be malleable enough to submit to authority; shocking them into a state where they regressed into a childlike fear, in which they are more inclined to do what they are told and trust what they are told. She shows that these techniques don’t just work on individuals, but whole societies too. In the aftermath of terrorist attacks, climate or economic crises, civil wars or dictatorships, societies are left in a state of collective shock and uncertainty, making them vulnerable to collective manipulation; “countries are shocked — by wars, terror attacks, coup d’état and natural disasters. And then they are shocked again — by corporations and politicians who exploit the fear and disorientation of this first shock to push through economic shock therapy” (Klein, 2007, p.26–27). She tracks how Milton Friedman developed this technique and advised politicians around the world on how and when to take advantage of the state of shock that societies are left in after these crises, by pushing through reforms or austerity measures that citizens might otherwise have resisted.Isabell Lorey states “just as the discourse of ‘financial crisis’ can and does work to sore up the need for greater managerial control of the market […], so the discourse of ‘precarity’ consolidates power among those who wield the power to alternately promise its alleviation and threaten its continuation.” The paper theorises that Trump is creating his own war, and his own shock in which to leave Americans in a state of uncertainty, requiring a saviour who will offer them a magic cure — and that that is exactly what he does, through self-congratulatory rhetoric and populist nationalism that pits the American people against a common enemy — in this case, the traumatic assault of an influx of “criminal” immigrants.By Daisy Bata, originally written as a Master’s Thesis on the Political Science Master’s at the Universitat Autónoma de Barcelona in August 2019ReferencesKlein, Naomi.

Ambiguities and buzz of Development,https://medium.com/@pragya.srivastava2405/ambiguities-and-buzz-of-development-73d08738dff5?source=tag_archive---------9-----------------------,"Development,Social Science,Political Science,Perspective,Sociology","Landmarks in the trajectory of the term Development.Development has remained a vogue word, nobody seems to understand what it means or what it wants to achieve but everyone wants to get ‘developed’. Despite the ambiguities associated with the term, it has remained popular and asserted its domination in the shape of institutions, ideologies practices, and policies.The discourse and practice of development are at a condemnatory intersection. Development was born as an aid, an expression of the modern obsession with caring. Development was also born in the context of the Cold War. Gustavo Esteva argues that underdevelopment was invented, and by changing the meaning of the word development, an emblem and euphemism were created placing the USA in an indisputable position. Since Truman gave his inaugural address on January 20, 1949, the dawn of underdevelopment had begun, and ever since development has “connoted at least one thing: to escape from the vague, indefinable, and undignified condition known as underdevelopment.” (Esteva, Gustava. “The Development Dictionary”. Development. Zed Books, 1992)Harry S Tuman Photo by Library of Congress on UnsplashGilbert Rist in ‘The History of Development: From Western Origins to Global Faith’ asserts the fact that development has remained a buzzword and implies a lot more than it means. Moreover, the definition of development comes with preconditions and presuppositions. Rist goes on to ask the question if the popular definitions of development are in fact operational definitions or it is just a fetish or a plastic word. Every modern government activity, the establishment of factories, opening educational institutions are labeled as development. Rist further says the problem with the definition of development is that the explanation comes from the believers of development who undoubtedly will advocate it and negate whatever harms them. The term development has had an interesting trajectory at different time frames and it explains how it has gone metamorphoses in the words of Rist. What is interesting here is that the idea of development does not seem to go away, Esteva calls it an unburied corpse. Wolfgang Sachs goes on to say that development stands like a ruin in the intellectual landscape, ‘delusion’, ‘disappointment’ and ‘crime’ have become adjectives to describe the failure of development.Borrowing from BiologyDevelopment in biological usage describes a process through which the potentialities of an object or an organism are released until it reaches its natural, complete, full-fledged form. Hence the metamorphic use of the term to explain the natural growth of plants and animals. Thereby the term became familiar with positive growth and desirable change. The social sphere borrowed from the biological connotation and development started to assert transformation in the political and social arenas. It had strong vernacular power and legitimized colonialism and turned history into the program. Development was overloaded with meanings that became part of the ordinary language in the 19th century. (Esteva, Gustava. “The Development Dictionary”. Development. Zed Books, 1992)Linking development with biological parlance further asserts that development is an inevitable process, something which cannot be escaped. ‘Directionality’, ‘continuity’, ‘cumulativeness’, and ‘irreversibility’ are the four features associated with the development of an organism and these can be applied to development in a socio-political setting as well. Development further goes on to deepen its ties with the positive biological connotation and hence legitimizing its position in the society by evoking a strong tradition stretching throughout the history of the world. (Rist, Gilbert. The History of Development: From Western Origins to Global Faith. Zed Books,2002)Landmarks in the trajectory of the term ‘Development’Aristotle and AntiquityAntiquity relied on two sources of knowledge, one relation to myth and the other relating to the knowledge of the philosophers. Among all the themes, the theme of change was the most persistent one. According to the mythological tradition, the transformation of the world was explained in various ages, and each of them unfolded in a cycle of growth, apogee, and decline. This understanding of evolution could also be applied in the everyday experience of the common plant and humans which helped in reinforcing the veracity of the myth.Against this backdrop, Aristotle (384–322 BCE) was trying to ground scientific reality by scientific knowledge by distinguishing between what can be known for certain and what depends on unforeseeable circumstances. There was thus a radical break from history by trying to grasp the sequence of causes determined by necessity. For Aristotle, the field of science was co-extensive with nature. For him, nature means the geneses of the moving things that participate in the process of growth, and nature in the primary sense is the essence of things which have in themselves a source of movement, a process of becoming and growing. This being the case Science according to Aristotle can be defined as a theory of nature that is the development of things and to examine things scientifically is to consider them according to their nature that is their development. For Aristotle nature is not confined only to the modern understanding of it but everything that has ‘physis’ of its own i.e. a principle of development. Nature assigns the final stage which corresponds to its perfect form but it does not mean that development can go on to an unlimited extent. Aristotle remains faithful to the theory of cycles which is the persistence in change and ceaseless return of the same. (Rist, Gilbert. ‘The History of Development: From Western Origins to Global Faith’.Zed Books,2002) Aristotle’s views spread to the entire ancient world and explanations how it was natural for an imperial power to draw to a close taking the case of the Roman Empire.Saint Augustine and the Theology of HistoryHe attempted to reconcile the philosophy of history of time with Christian theology. It was a major shift from the Aristotelian point of view in a number of ways. For instance, history was God’s intervention for him, unlike Aristotle who refused to get involved in the accidents of history and concentrated on the force of development. Christianity added supernature to nature and replaced personal growth with divine omnipotence. Aristotle allowed both for change and return of the same but Christianity could not conceive of the return of the same for history unfolded according to God’s plan. Augustine applies constituents of the cyclical theory by applying them to history as a whole. He considers natural phenomena and socio-historical events as an expression of God’s plan for humanity. The most significant break in his theory is breaking away from a cyclical growth to a single one corresponding to the history of salvation. Augustine’s work influenced the history of development in three aspects. Firstly, his philosophy of history in the history of salvation concerns the whole humankind, unlike earlier authors who were focused on the local. Secondly, history does occupy an important place, but this is secondary to the philosophy of history. Thirdly, history does obey necessity, and God’s design will inevitably come to pass. (Rist, Gilbert. ‘The History of Development: From Western Origins to Global Faith’.Zed Books,2002).The Enlightenment and Infinite ProgressDisputes among scholars concerning the superiority of classical Greek and Roman authors over contemporary writers have occurred at least since the time of the Renaissance. In the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, however, such debates turned into heated conflicts, particularly in France and England. Ancients who upheld the authority of the writers of antiquity in intellectual matters — against the Moderns — who maintained that writers of the present day possessed greater knowledge and more-refined tastes than their predecessors. Underlying these positions were fundamental assumptions regarding the state of the art, culture, and human knowledge. The Ancients viewed Greco-Roman civilization as the apex of human achievement and all subsequent culture as a decline from this high point. Thus, they contended, Moderns were in no position to judge the ancients, who were their superiors. The Moderns, on their side, saw human knowledge and understanding as progressing since antiquity. They considered classical works as admirable in certain respects, but also crude and in need of correction and improvement.What remains from this debate between the ancients and the moderns is the principle of growth. The ideology of progress acquired a dominant position in the 17th century. According to Rist even if development never ceased to be regarded in the western tradition, they were long kept in check by the awareness of a limit but soon this barrier was collapsed placing development on infinite progress.Triumphs of Social EvolutionismIn the 19th century, it was a general belief that progress has the same path and all nations travel the same road and not all societies develop at the rate of Westernized societies which play a dominant role in the technological, scientific advancement and the only societies to survive will be those of industry multiplies. Here we should distinguish Charles Darwin's theory of evolutionism with social evolutionism. Social evolutionism is a theory of history whereas Darwin’s theory is a biological evolutionism. It becomes extremely important to highlight the fact that at a political level, social evolutionism legitimized the new wave of colonialism which was a feature of the late 19th century. (Rist, Gilbert. ‘The History of Development: From Western Origins to Global Faith’.Zed Books,2002).Development is a shapeless slime that structures itself according to the conditions of society and finds a way to stay alive. In the 20th century, development took the form of urban development based on homogenous mass production. It gave a legal color to colonialism by promising to vanish the undignified conditions of underdevelopment. The Truman Design was so planned to establish the hierarchy of the initiatives that the ‘modernizers’ want to promote. Esteva points out in the same context that in Latin America, the Peace Corps, the Point Four Program, and Alliance for Progress contributed to the root notion of underdevelopment. For them, Truman had simply replaced backwardness with underdevelopment. (Esteva, Gustava. “The Development Dictionary”. Development. Zed Books, 1992)Development was very soon reduced only to economic growth as echoed in the UN Charter 1947. Walter Rostow in his Non-Communist Manifesto gives a description of the economic growth and its stages (primitive economy, preconditions for take-off, take-off, maturity, and mass consumption) all of them being short-sighted economic policies assuming the character of all the societies in a single variable. Development was reduced to economic growth in terms of GNP and GDP.Once it was realized that economic growth and development were not enough, soon the social factor was included in the meaning of development in the 1960s evident from the creation of the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development in 1963. The 1960s is also called the first developmental decade. One of the major change that was seen as that social change was seen as a precondition for economic growth.The 1970s is referred to as the second developmental decade. Again it is interesting to note that despite the debate on the optimism of economic growth, the idea of GNP does not go away, social development is added on the shelf of economic development. Robert McNamara, president of World Bank raised the point that after recognizing a high level of economic growth does not bring satisfactory in the first decade, the 1970s should see something more than something than gross measures of economic growth. Problems of environment, hunger, population, women, and employment were brought to the forefront. In 1974 the Declaration of Cocoyoc emphasized that the purpose of ‘development’ should also to develop man not just things. The idea of human-centered had come as another development under the proposals of the Dag Hammarskjold Foundation in 1975.The next decade, the 1980s, was called the lost decade for development. The adjustment process meant for many countries abandoning or dismantling, in the name of development, most of the previous achievements. By 1985, a post-development age seemed to be in the offing. The 1990s, by contrast, have given birth to a new development ethos. According to Rist, this follows two clearly distinguishable lines. In the North, it calls for redevelopment — that is, to develop again what was mal-developed or is now obsolete. Conceptually and politically, redevelopment is now taking the shape of sustainable development, for our common future, as prescribed by the Brundtland Commission. In the South, the redevelopment also requires dismantling what was left by the adjustment process of the 1980s, in order to make room for the leftovers from the North (atomic waste, obsolete or polluting manufacturing plants, unsellable or prohibited commodities). (Esteva, Gustava. “The Development Dictionary”. Development. Zed Books, 1992)Interesting in this regard is the work of A.G. Frank who addresses a periodic presentation of the history of the world system. Both the processes of development and underde­velopment commenced in the mercantile period (1500–1770), carried through into industrial capitalism (1770–1870), and culminated in imperialism (1870–1930). Throughout the process, the colonies, semi-colonies, and neo-colonies existed primarily for the benefit of the capitalist metropolis and as a direct result became underdeveloped.The developed/underdeveloped dichotomy that continues to this day. The future of development studies lies in archaeology, to explore the ruins it left behind by looking at development’s pre-history and conceptual history, as well as the development enterprise. The meaning of development to date remains vague but the idea is not going away but rather seeking different ways to stay alive. In this era, development comes to mean escaping underdevelopment. So to develop you first have to be seen as underdeveloped in the eyes of the developer. Esteva calls this colonizing anti-colonialism. Underdevelopment becomes a new word for backwardness and poverty; the very social conditions that legitimize foreign intervention or neo-colonialism. This new form of foreign intervention has one key feature according to Esteva: economic growth. Money is seen as the only way of escaping underdevelopment.The meaning of the term development remains formless, tending to refer to a set of beliefs and assumptions about the nature of social progress rather than to anything more precise. Development was born as a promise to escape the realities of poverty but more than anything it has promoted conditions of supposed underdevelopment and some leaning countries is playing forever catch-up with the leading countries.Written byPragya SrivastavaPolitical Science Major who finds everything amusing.Follow101 101 101 DevelopmentSocial SciencePolitical SciencePerspectiveSociologyMore from Pragya SrivastavaFollowPolitical Science Major who finds everything amusing.More From MediumOn Disagreeing with PlatoDavid J.

The Other Side Is More Rational Than You Think,https://arcdigital.media/the-other-side-is-more-rational-than-you-think-2137349204c7?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Politics,Polarization,Political Science,Psychology,Philosophy","(Getty/Arc)Polarization is rising in the United States. We all know it. We can sense it. Beyond our own impressions, it’s what the data clearly tells us. Year by year, members of each party agree more amongst themselves, and less with the other side. As a result, they increasingly demonize the other side. From 1994 to 2016, the percentage of Republicans with “very unfavorable” attitudes toward the Democratic Party rose from 21 percent to 58 percent, with a whopping 91 percent having an overall “unfavorable” attitude. The numbers for Democrats are similar.Why is this happening? It has become commonplace to point to irrational causes as the drivers of polarization: people are subject to reasoning errors like confirmation bias, motivated reasoning, identity-protective cognition, biased assimilation of evidence, and so on.What we are told is that these biases have led people to misuse the internet: they tend to look only at news sources that agree with their beliefs, to share and promote only articles that confirm them, to talk with and trust only those who agree with them, and so on. And that, we are told, is why we are polarized.Hateful HobbyistsReview of Politics is for Power by Eitan Hersh and Why We’re Polarized by Ezra Kleinarcdigital.mediaThis irrationalist explanation of polarization is familiar and intuitive.It’s also wrong.There’s a simple and compelling argument that we can’t view polarization as due primarily to irrational causes.To see why, take some political belief on which Americans are sharply polarized — say, whether Trump is doing a good job. (Current polling: Republicans: 92 percent; Democrats: 4 percent.) For the sake of argument, let’s imagine you think he’s not doing a good job.Now ask yourself: how did you form this opinion about Trump? I’m guessing you won’t say: “Due to confirmation bias and motivated reasoning, I listened primarily to sources that told me what I wanted to hear, and discredited information that suggested otherwise. That’s why I came to think he’s doing a bad job.”You won’t say that because you can’t believe that. Put bluntly: it’s incoherent to think, “Trump’s doing a bad job — but I’m irrational to believe that.” After all, you can’t believe that your own beliefs are irrational. More generally: to the extent that you think your confidence in your opinions is irrationally placed, you must become less confident in those opinions.This means that if you are to hold onto your political beliefs, then you must think that you formed them in a largely rational way. (As, I imagine, you do.)Human Beings Are Intrinsically Tribal. So Of Course Our Politics Will Also Be.Amy Chua on the inherently tribal nature of American politicsarcdigital.mediaBy extension, you must think similarly about those who agree with you on politics. For no one can sensibly think to themselves, “I formed my beliefs rationally — but all my friends, who agree with me and formed their beliefs in similar ways, did so irrationally.” That means that you must think that those on your side of the political divide formed their opinions, by and large, rationally.Here’s the catch: the evidence is resounding that the mechanisms that drive polarization — confirmation bias, motivated reasoning, biased assimilation, and so on — are bipartisan: both sides are equally susceptible to them.That means that the other side formed their beliefs through the same processes that your side did. We’ve seen that you can’t believe your side is irrational. So it follows that you shouldn’t think the other side is, either.That’s not to say you shouldn’t think they’re wrong. You should. After all, your belief that Trump’s not doing a good job was rationally formed. The other side believes that he is doing a good job. Their belief is inconsistent with yours. So you should think that their belief is wrong.But just because you think it’s wrong doesn’t mean you need to think it was formed irrationally. As we’ve seen, you shouldn’t think that — at least, not if you want to both hold onto your own belief and respect the psychological evidence.Of course, you might try to point to various asymmetries between the parties to justify thinking the other side is less rational than you. Trump is, indeed — how do I put this softly? — more erratic than Democratic leaders. AOC is, indeed, a socialist — which is, to many Republicans, a stronger pejorative. And so on. There are plenty of differences between the parties.The trouble is, those differences aren’t what make the difference. Let me explain.We know what psychological mechanisms drive people to polarize: confirmation bias, motivated reasoning, selective exposure to news and opinions, and so on. As we’ve seen, such mechanisms are not correlated with the various asymmetries between the parties. This means you shouldn’t use such partisan asymmetries to conclude that the other side is less rational than yours. What, then, should you conclude?You should conclude that those asymmetries explain why the other side has been misled. Rational mechanisms — the same ones that have led you to your beliefs — have led them to see very different information, to interpret shared information in very different ways, and so on. Fortunately, these processes have led you to the truth about Trump. Unfortunately, they have led them away from it. (They, of course, should draw the exact opposite conclusion.)Why Polarization Won’t Go AwayMost people agree that politics has become too hostile, toxic, and polarized. So why does it remain that way?arcdigital.mediaThat is what you should think about our polarized politics. But can you? Is this story consistent with the empirical evidence about polarization?Yes. The standard irrationalist narrative consists of two parts. Part 1 is an empirical account of the mechanisms (“confirmation bias”, etc.) that drive polarization. Part 2 is a normative interpretation of those mechanisms — in particular, the claim that they are irrational.Part 1 is well-confirmed by a plethora of empirical research. Part 2 is not. In fact, it consists largely of empirical researchers applying over-simplified models of rationality to their data, and concluding that the way people reason in these scenarios is not the way rational people would reason in them.Thus we can accept Part 1 and deny Part 2. That is: we can agree that “confirmation bias,” “motivated reasoning,” and the like are what lead to polarization, and deny that such processes are necessarily irrational. In fact, it turns out that all of these “biases” are to be expected from rational people who care about the truth but face systematically ambiguous evidence.This story of rational polarization is one we can believe. For it allows us to hold onto our political beliefs, since it doesn’t require us to think they are irrational. The catch? We must think that the other side is rational to hold onto their beliefs as well — even though (we think) those beliefs are wrong.Viral Politics in an Age of Hyper-PolarizationNot even pandemics seem capable of dissolving our political differencesarcdigital.mediaSuppose we buy this new, rational story of polarization. What does it imply? Two things.First, it implies that we are in a sort of tragedy: individually rational processes are collectively pulling us apart. That means the way to reduce polarization is not to make individuals more rational consumers of information — they are already doing the best that can be expected. Rather, any successful solution will require changing the structure of our interactions to tamp down on the differential spread of ambiguous and misleading information.Second, it implies that we shouldn’t blame our political opponents for believing as they do. We can — we should — think they are wrong; but we shouldn’t think they are wrong for irrational or biased reasons. Instead, we should think they are doing the best they can with the (mis)information they have.We’re Not Doomed To Be PolarizedA Democrat, a Republican, and a search for common groundarcdigital.mediaThis, I think, should be welcome news. For if we all recognize that the other side is no less rational than our own, that may go some way toward easing the inter-party demonization that is the true tragedy of American polarization.Arc DigitalThe internet’s best opinion pageFollow569 24 PoliticsPolarizationPolitical SciencePsychologyPhilosophy569 claps569 claps24 responsesWritten byKevin DorstFollowPhilosopher at Oxford working on the question of how irrational we truly are.FollowArc DigitalFollowThe internet’s best opinion pageFollowWritten byKevin DorstFollowPhilosopher at Oxford working on the question of how irrational we truly are.Arc DigitalFollowThe internet’s best opinion pageMore From MediumThis Is Fine.

Small changes in survey scales can matter when measuring political ideology in Europe,https://medium.com/pew-research-center-decoded/small-changes-in-survey-scales-can-matter-when-measuring-political-ideology-in-europe-4a10d9a015c5?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Polling,Surveys,Survey Research,Research Methods,Political Science","(Pew Research Center illustration/Wee People)(Related post: On a scale from 1 to 10, how much do the numbers used in survey scales really matter?)At Pew Research Center, survey questions about respondents’ political ideology are among the most important measures in our comparative, cross-national surveys. Our recent research in Europe, for instance, explored how political polarization in the region shapes long-standing debates about domestic, social and economic policies.To measure political ideology, our international questionnaires typically ask respondents to place themselves on a 7-point scale with two labeled endpoints (or anchors) — “extreme left” and “extreme right” — along with numbers for all of the points in between. However, some research suggests that it’s easier for respondents to understand a fully labeled scale, one that includes descriptions for the interior points as well, such as “leaning left,” “leaning right,” or “center.” In this post, we’ll describe a survey experiment we conducted to find out if two approaches to measuring the same concept align with — or diverge from — each other.Findings at a glanceOur survey experiment was part of nationally representative telephone surveys we fielded in France, Spain and the United Kingdom in the spring of 2018. (You can read about an earlier experiment related to survey scales in this Decoded post.)The 2018 surveys asked about political ideology in two ways. First, midway through each interview, respondents were asked the Center’s standard ideology question using a 7-point numeric response scale with only the endpoints labeled. Then, after several more questions, respondents were asked to describe themselves using a fully labeled, 5-point scale.Here are some of the trends we observed across all three countries:· The most common response option for both scales was the midpoint, though a greater share of respondents chose the midpoint on the 7-point scale (“3”) than on the 5-point scale (“center”).· More respondents identified as right of center on the 7-point scale but left of center on the 5-point scale.· Respondents were more likely to choose the endpoints on the 5-point scale than on the 7-point scale, and this was especially true for those on the ideological left.· Levels of item nonresponse (either “don’t know” or refusal to answer) were similar using both approaches.A closer look at France using Sankey diagramsThese aggregate numbers don’t tell the whole story. Fortunately, we can go a step further with our experimental data. By asking all respondents to answer both versions of our ideology question, we can also see how each respondent answered — or “moved” — from one question to the other.To illustrate these patterns, we created Sankey diagrams for each country using the R package ggalluvial. These graphs are a type of flow diagram that illustrate the movement from one category to the next — in this case, from the 7-point scale to the 5-point version. The band thickness in Sankey diagrams indicates the number of people taking a particular path, with thicker bands showing the more common pathways between two points on our different scales. (We should note at the outset that this part of our analysis does not include respondents who answered “don’t know” or refused to respond. It is limited to the 2,625 respondents who answered both ideology questions, including 846 in France, 935 in Spain and 844 in the UK.)In the graph on the left, we’ll focus on French respondents who answered “0 — Extreme left” on the ideology question using the 7-point scale. Of the 55 French respondents who reported “0 — Extreme left,” most of them (31) chose “left” when later asked to identify their political ideology using the 5-point scale. These respondents are represented by the highlighted horizontal line straight across the top of the chart.But what about the 24 other people in France who chose the “0 — Extreme left” option? These respondents are represented by three narrower bands that start at “0 — Extreme left” and then slide down and to the right in the chart. Overall, most of these respondents (18) chose “leaning left.” Far fewer moved to “center” (five respondents) or “right” (one respondent). None of the respondents who answered “0 — Extreme left” on the 7-point scale reported “leaning right” on the 5-point scale.The full range of patterns between the two scales in France is provided in the next Sankey diagram, with the path of each combination of responses illustrated by a different color.A few trends emerge in this graph:· About half of the respondents (53%) who selected the midpoint on the 7-point scale also chose “center” on the 5-point scale, as illustrated by the thickest yellow band connecting “3” to “center.” Among those who chose the midpoint on the 7-point scale but did not choose “center” on the 5-point scale, roughly twice as many placed themselves left of center than right of center: 31% versus 17%.· Nine-in-ten (90%) of those on the left of the 7-point scale identified as left of center on the 5-point scale as well, as illustrated by nearly all of the blue bands above the midpoint moving to either “left” or “leaning left.” Overall, 7% of those who characterized their ideology as left of center on the 7-point scale moved to “center” on the 5-point scale, while 3% moved to “leaning right” or “right.”· Around two-thirds of respondents (66%) who placed themselves on the right of the 7-point scale also chose “right” or “leaning right” on the 5-point scale. Surprisingly, more of those who identified as right of center on the 7-point scale identified as “left” or “leaning left” on the 5-point scale (21%) than moved to the center (13%). This is shown by the similarly sized orange and red paths heading to “left,” “leaning left,” and “center.”· Of the 35 possible response combinations between questions, no respondents in France answered “0 — Extreme left” on the 7-point scale and later identified as “leaning right” on the 5-point scale, or answered “1” and then identified as “center” or “leaning right.”Cross-national results from the experimentSankey diagrams can also be helpful to illustrate and better understand cross-national patterns in our three selected countries. As the next chart shows, several of the broad trends we observed in France are apparent in Spain and the UK as well:Here’s a closer look at what’s happening in this chart:· Across all three countries, most respondents who chose the midpoint on the 7-point scale also chose “center” on the 5-point scale (53% in France, 52% in Spain and 59% in the UK). And just as in France, more people moved from the midpoint of the 7-point scale to left of center on the 5-point scale than moved to the right on the 5-point scale.· In all three countries, the overwhelming majority of those who placed themselves on the left of the 7-point scale also identified as left of center on the 5-point scale (90% in France, 94% in Spain and 89% in the UK).· There is more variability among those who placed themselves on the right of the 7-point scale. While 66% of those on the ideological right in France also placed themselves on the right of the 5-point scale, the share who did so was lower in both Spain (52%) and the UK (61%). Respondents on the ideological right of the 7-point scale in Spain and the UK were more likely than their counterparts in France to move to the center on the 5-point scale (26% in Spain and 25% in the UK versus 13% in France).· As was the case in France, a few combinations of responses were not found in Spain and the UK. No respondents in Spain answered “0 — Extreme left” and then “center” or “leaning right,” or, in another combination, “1” and then a right-of-center response. Similarly, in the UK, no respondents first answered “0 — Extreme left” or “1” and then “right.”As illustrated in the Sankey diagrams, there is general ideological consistency at the individual respondent level between the two survey questions, with only a limited share of people in each country providing apparently contradictory answers. In fact, only 11 of our 2,625 respondents provided the opposite extremes to the two scales (“0-Extreme left” and right or “6-Extreme right” and left). The robustness of these measures across countries suggests that both items can be useful in estimating political ideology. Across countries, our respondents behaved similarly, but not exactly the same. This is reflected in the subtle variability in responses to these two questions that are seemingly measuring the same thing.Concluding thoughtsBoth scales have benefits. A 5-point, fully labeled scale allows respondents to identify with a qualitative description of their political leaning, while a 7-point, endpoint labeled scale provides respondents with more choices to select a position closest to their political ideology. While the two survey questions are different in scale size and wording, respondents across countries answered them in similar patterns, giving us confidence in both when conducting cross-country comparisons.There are several caveats, however. The experiment relied on relatively small samples that limited our findings in a few ways. For example, we could not conduct robust analyses across all possible answer combinations because some were too infrequent and others nonexistent. And while some respondents answered with “don’t know” or refused to answer at all, the number of people who did so was relatively small, limiting our ability to draw inferences about this group.Aside from sample size, there are a few other issues we would consider expanding upon in future experiments. For instance, we did not rotate question order to examine whether replying to the first ideology question affected respondents’ answers to the second question or subsequent items. Also, we tested only two response scales, which means we could not assess the merits of other permutations, such as the results of a fully labeled, 7-point scale or a numeric, endpoint-labeled 5-point scale.Finally, the questions we tested weren’t equivalent. The Center’s standard political ideology question includes the words “extreme” (in the 7-point scale itself) and “center” (in the question stem), but this is not the case in the alternative 5-point scale and associated question. Additional experimental conditions — say, keeping the scale length the same but testing different wordings, or vice versa — would allow us to disentangle these effects.To dig deeper, it might be useful to look beyond the survey results. It’s possible some respondents were confused when we asked for their political ideology twice, so one way to explore the issue would be to incorporate cognitive interviewing in future experiments. This may help researchers better understand the meaning of survey questions, including questions that ask about the same underlying concept, from a respondent’s point of view.In the meantime, we plan to use the data from this experiment to further study whether one of these ideology questions is a more accurate or valid measure than the other. Comparing each question with other items asked in our surveys — such as respondents’ political party affiliation or their opinions on highly politicized topics — would provide additional insights, with the help of Sankey diagrams to visualize the results.This post was written by Martha McRoy and Stacy Pancratz.

When Futurism Gets Stuck in the Past,https://medium.com/curious/when-futurism-gets-stuck-in-the-past-6052294ea579?source=tag_archive---------2-----------------------,"Futurism,World Government,Enlightenment,Universalism,Political Science","The western historical imagination has been haunted by the collapse of the Roman Empire, here illustrated by Thomas Cole in his painting “Desolation” (1836) from the series “The Course of Empire”Ever since I first became interested in futurism in the 1970s, and I began to read everything I could find on futurism, I noticed the almost exclusive interest in world government as the political paradigm of futurism, and even at the time I thought it was odd. I still find it odd today, and so I have gone looking for explanations for the political monoculture of futurism. Let me begin with a speculation — nothing that I consider to be definitive, but only one possible explanation among many — and after my speculation I will move on to a more analytical understanding of the world government paradigm in futurism.Historical thought in western civilization is haunted by the collapse of the Roman Empire. The Romans expanded their political control over the entirety of the Mediterranean Basin and maintained this universal empire for hundreds of years. If we take Rome from its foundation to its last effective presence at Byzantium, its history can be measured in millennia, like Ancient Egyptian civilization. Western historians always have, in their back of their minds, the cautionary tale of Rome: a single, universal civilization effectively dominating the known world, utterly failing and leaving in its wake confusion, social collapse, conflict, and Balkanization. This cautionary tale is often understood as a moral lesson for our time (cf. Manifest Destiny: Roman and American).No historical narrative that summarizes thousands of years of history into some neat schema could ever be quite true; it is an oversimplification in order to give us a “big picture” view of the trajectory of western civilization, but oversimplifications have their place, side-by-side with soporific detail. Either approach risks alienating some part of the audience, which audience is us, today, inheriting these historical traditions at the same time as we look forward into the future.It is possible that this oversimplified narrative of Roman expansion, overextension, decline, and failure is the source of the idée fixe of world government in futurism. World government is what was effectively lost when the western Roman Empire failed, and western civilization ever since that time can be understood as the conscious or unconscious attempt to recover that lost world government of the Roman imperium. Dante was quite explicit about this in his pamphlet De Monarchia (often translated into English as On World Government).Whether or not the explanation of the world government idée fixe ultimately is to be derived from the western historical imagination being haunted by the specter of Roman collapse, or is due to some other cause, is not ultimately decisive; it may bear upon the question and its eventual resolution, but I do not think it will be decisive. So let us widen our scope and consider three other sources of the intellectual fixation on world government; specifically, let us consider three ideas that loom large in the idea of world government, even if these ideas are not often made explicit:The Political IdeaThe Planetary IdeaThe Universalist IdeaWe will take up each of these in turn.The Political IdeaIf we understand civilization to be a form of social organization, and we understand social organization to be intrinsically and essentially political, then it follows that civilization is intrinsically and essentially political. In brief, civilization is a political phenomenon. And one can further conclude that, when the scattered and diverse civilizations of our homeworld began to grow together in a planetary concrescence, because the world entire is settled and populated, then the emergent planetary civilization, being intrinsically and essentially political, should also be converging on a common planetary political framework. The scattered and diverse political structures of the once numerous civilization of our world would, it seems, also grow together into a planetary concrescence of political institutions.If, on the other hand, one denies that civilization is intrinsically and essentially political, then the growing together of civilizations originally separate does not necessarily entail the growing together of political regimes originally separate. Civililzation may become planetary (arguably, it is already planetary at this time), but since civilization is not intrinsically or essentially political, the planetary scale of civilization does not entail planetary scale political institutions.The relationship of civilization to political order is a complex one, so that one might argue either side of the question and be able to produce historical examples of either the coincidence of civilization and political order, or the divergence of civilization and political order. Clearly, one of the emergent properties of civilization has been the emergence of sophisticated political institutions. This has been necessary because civilizations join together a far larger number of individuals than can be found in a nomadic band of hunter-gatherers, a tribe, or a clan, which usually increase to the number of individuals with whom stable social relationships are possible (known as Dunbar’s number), and fission thereafter. The institutions of civilization are a “work around” for the limitations imposed by Dunbar’s number.However, emergent political institutions of civilization do not necessarily entail top-down unification of peoples in relation to some central authority (and the idea that the unified peoples inhabit a particular geographical territory is a later artifact of the territorial principle in law, which more or less corresponds with the origins of the nation-state). One of the most familiar forms that civilization takes is that of a network of cities bound in relationships of cooperation, competition, and conflict with one another (I call this my pragmatic definition of civilization), all cities of which network share in a common civilization, but not a common government. We find this pattern among the cities of ancient Mesopotamia, swept now into one empire, and then later into another, and we find the same pattern among the Mayan cities of ancient Mesoamerica, as well as among the many cities of the Indus Valley civilization, and so on. We understand that when Siyaj Kʼakʼ installed Yax Nuun Ahiin I as king of Tikal in 379 AD that this was a political struggle internal to Mayan civilization and that it does not represent the conquest of one civilization by another.I argue that the identification of civilization with a (single) political regime is reductionist, since civilization is a much more comprehensive conception than that of political order, as seen from rival political orders contending for power within one and the same civilization. That some civilizations have been unified on an imperial basis (e.g., ancient Egypt after the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt about 3100 BC, and China throughout much of its history since Ying Zheng founded the Qin Dynasty after the Warring States period) demonstrates only that imperial unification of one civilization into a single political order is one possibility among many possible political orders that might hold within a given civilization.The Planetary IdeaIn the distant past, when there were far fewer human beings, the size of Earth was sufficient to be effectively indefinite in extent. Small bands of hunter-gatherers could wander for generations, crossing paths with other bands, but with any band able to seek its own uncontested territory if only that band were willing to migrate further than its neighbors. As noted in the above section, nomadic bands fell well within the limits of Dunbar’s number, and as this number was approached by a growing band, that band could fission and the resulting two or more bands would then be free to go their separate ways, maintaining the effective social order.Later, when civilizations began to appear — and even before that when nomadic bands began to settle down into patterns of village agriculture — still Earth was large enough that civilizations could expand to the extent of their ability, sometimes impinging upon other civilizations, but also often without opposition. The remaining nomadic bands would recede further from arable land as the settled agricultural peoples expanded, with the last of the nomadic bands either retreating into the mountains and becoming mountain peoples with a distinctive way of life dictated by this distinctive geography, or becoming pastoralists and eventually horse nomads who learned to raid and to conquer the settled peoples through their mastery of mobile fire.Now the entirety of Earth’s surface has been mapped and claimed and there are no frontiers; all territories are claimed by nation-states, or their administration is agreed upon by nation-states (as with the “Empty Quarter” in the Arabian Peninsula or Antarctica). Territorial expansion is now a zero sum game: one nation-state can expand only at the expense of another nation-state. With Earth being entirely divided up among nation-states, civilization is to be found on every inhabited continent, and many of the institutions of civilization are planetary in scale. The Earth itself is the limit, the natural teleology, of civilization. Or, at least, Earth is the natural teleology of planetary civilization.Having converged upon planetary civilization, the planetary idea presents iself: the natural telos of civilization is understood also to be the natural telos of humanity, of political order, of history, of society, of culture, and of civilization. Earth is entirely a civilized planet; the natural order of things is that the planet entire will slowly converge upon a consolidation of all institutions of planetary scale, including political institutions.Needless to say, this unification of natural teleologies into an overarching planetary teleology is strictly speaking a non sequitur; we have no a priori assurance that the events and activities on Earth are “naturally” limited to Earth and find their fulfillment on Earth. Arguably, we have already imagined elaborate futures for civilization beyond Earth, so that even if human civilization fails to make a spacefaring breakout (or, alternatively, to achieve such an inflection point), we can still conceptualize spacefaring civilization, and if spacefaring civilization is not realized in actuality, it becomes an unfulfilled potential — meaning that the fulfillment represented by planetary civilization does not exhaust the meaning of civilization as it has developed to date.The Universalist IdeaSince the Enlightenment, the idea that there should be universally applicable ideas and institutions, equally valid for all peoples at all times and in all places, has gained the upper hand over a de facto particularism, to the point that one must draw attention to this Enlightenment universalism simply to be aware of its presence as a pervasive influence on our conceptions of political order. Universalism has become like the air we breathe, or the water through which fish swim: it is the unquestioned medium that supports and surrounds everything else that we do.Universalism as applied to political thought holds that there is a uniquely optimal political structure through which human beings can best govern themselves. When Francis Fukuyama asserted in his “The End of History?” essay (1989) that this universal political order was none other than liberal democracy, which had won the Cold War contest and proved itself to be the “last man standing” after a global ideological war, this was, in a sense, the culmination of the Enlightenment trajectory toward a new political system that would replace the feudal hierarchies of the past.It could be argued that the Roman idea of a cosmopolitan order was a pre-Enlightenment conception of political universalism; this may well be true, and, while I do not gainsay this interpretation, I see it in the context of larger developments. The backward-looking character of renaissance humanism, that raised the norms and ideals of classical antiquity as a superior model to that of the otherworldly ideals of the Middle Ages, institutionalized the Roman imperium in the western historical imagination, and it could be argued that the Enlightenment seamlessly took up this idealization of classical antiquity and ran with it in order to create its own norm and ideal of Enlightenment universalism. Enlightenment universalism, then, could be understood as the culmination of a long development in western history evolving from a cosmopolitanian Hellenism of late antiquity to the explicit statement and political formulation of an idealized universal form of civilization.A Retrograde IdealThe idea of world government is backward-looking if we understand it as the attempt to recover the Roman achievement, it is backward-looking if we understand it as a tradition of futurist thought (there are comprehensive articles on world government on Wikipedia and the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, both of which discuss the long intellectual pedigree of the idea), and it is backward looking if world government is simply taken as the default position of futurism, the unquestioned political paradigm of futurism, because futurism has always advocated for world government.It would not be at all difficult for anyone who cared to do so, to investigate the possible permutations of political forms that future civilization might take, with an emphasis upon exploring possibilities that have been neglected in the light of the intellectual fixation on world government. That this has not happened in any kind of systematic way is a glaring weakness in futurist thought. The impoverishment of our political futurism is a reflection of an inability or unwillingness to think critically about political institutions, and especially to think critically about the big picture of political institutions in space and time. One must maintain a cultivated blindness to the complex reality of political institutions, and how they have functioned through history, to maintain unquestioned the idea of world government either as a practical outcome of planetary-scale civilization or as an ideal state of human affairs.This is especially true in relationship to the idea of law. Without studying law one tends to view the institution of law as monolithic, but, in fact, law is anything but monolithic. There are many systems of law employed by many different political entities of overlapping jurisdictions. For one small example, a distinction is made between private international law and public international law, with private international law governing interaction of private individuals from different nation-states, and public international law being a agreed-upon framework within which independent nation-states resolve differences. As war takes place within the framework of public international law, nation-states may choose to resolve their differences through armed conflict and still abide by the provisions of public international law.If one conceptualizes world government as a single system of law for everyone, this idea is so out of touch with the reality of law — its tradition, it formulation, its promulgation, its policing, and its enforcement, all of which involve distinct institutions (the legislature, the executive, police, and courts) — it would be difficult to know where to start in pointing out the flaws in this idea.The Code Napoléon represented an attempt to formulate an Enlightenment universal civil code that prevailed throughout much of the Francophone world, but, significantly, the civil code was not truly universal in so far as it did not also serve as a military code, a criminal code, or a commercial code, each of which sectors had codes distinctive to each aspect of life. A comprehensive code can be cobbled together by joining the codes for distinct sectors of society and the economy, but when a legal code is assembled in this way ex post facto, it will inevitably involve conflicts that need to be rationalized. This was the situation with Roman law when Justinian commissioned the Corpus Iuris Civilis, which was a compendium and synthesis of Roman law that aimed to rationalize hundreds of years of Roman law into a single system of law.The Corpus Iuris Civilis was formulated in Byzantium when Roman civilization had already largely failed in western civilization, so that as European civilization took shape in the aftermath of Roman collapse, it eventually came to draw upon the Corpus Iuris Civilis (which haunted the western historical imagination in law as in other areas of life), but it also drew from the traditions of law among the German tribes (the “barbarians”), as well as eventually from the English common law tradition, which represents the other focal point of legal thought in the western tradition, which is bookended by Roman statutory law and English common law, which latter is a body of case law.This brief sketch of the prolixity of legal traditions within the context of a single civilization could easily be multiplied. Most civilizations have a multiplicity of legal traditions superimposed upon each other over a long history, so that there are many legal codes that can claim to be traditional, and none that can claim to be universal. This is true for all the institutions of civilization, in each and every tradition of civilization; pluralism is the reality that cannot be wished away. Rather than engage in shadowboxing between the reality of a plurality of legal traditions and the monolithic shade of a pretense to universal legal traditions, we should embrace the reality of pluralism and learn to live with it, both at the level of local institutions and at the level of planetary institutions.Taking Politics Seriously in a Planetary ContextI have earlier pointed out that one of the great disconnects in western thought is that between philosophy of law and political philosophy. One would suppose that law is the implementation of politics, and politics the sum total of law, so that these bodies of thought would be related as idea to execution, but in fact we find problems in the philosophy of law being discussed in a conceptual framework that only partially overlaps with political philosophy, and vice versa, so that there is no systematic approach to identifying problems common to both, much less resolving these problems. The philosophy of law in Anglo-American analytical philosophy has become tightly focused on legal positivism, while political philosophy remains mired in the presuppositions implied above that follow from unquestioned Enlightenment universalism.We need to move beyond both the retrograde ideal of planetary governance and the disconnection between legal and political institutions. Taking politics seriously in a planetary context would mean a planetary revaluation of all values (what Nietzsche called Umwertung aller Werte), which in turn would mean a planetary revaluation of law and legal institutions, of politics and political institutions, and overcoming the disconnect between the two. Those who look toward planetary governance as an ideal for humanity have an intellectual responsibility not merely to invoke an empty concept of world governance, but to conduct just such a thorough-going revaluation of legal, political, and civilizational institutions, so that they can offer concrete proposals that transcend the past rather than recreating past follies on a larger scale.This is not something that could be accomplished by one comprehensive book, or by a few books. This would require a multi-generational research project that would benefit from the contribution of the best minds of all the world’s civilizations, spontaneously and willingly cooperating in the enterprise because the idea of planetary ideals and values becomes so compelling that one cannot but dedicate oneself to it. Until such time as such a multi-generational research project comes into being and begins to bear fruit, one should not make the mistake of taking the idea of world governance seriously, as in its current state it is merely the province of dilettantes, who have little of substance on offer. Until then, we are better off investing our time in studying permutations of the nation-state and how it is expressed in the anarchic international state system, since there is at least an extant body of scholarship undergirding this context for planetary affairs.Konstantin Yuon, “New Planet” (1921)CuriousFind out what others have already figured out.

Is beauty really subjective?,https://medium.com/@abhishekyadav8105/the-philosophy-of-beauty-6d516a4e104?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"Philosophy,Philosopher,Beauty,Political,Political Science","Image by: morhamedufmgIs a red rose as beautiful to you as it is to me? Is a messy room beautiful to you? Do you find a hillside sunrise attractive? How do we predispose ourselves to embrace whether “beauty” is universal?From the ancient Greek philosophers like Plato and Aristotle to Shaftesbury, Hume, and Kant, almost all the philosophers have engaged with the questions above. While the meaning of “beauty” has been contended on various premises like aesthetics vs. ethics, love and longing, classical vs. idealist conceptions, I will primarily focus on the objectivity vs. subjectivity of beauty and how different philosophers, through their works, have made a stance in the literary debate.One of the most common narratives or the theory of beauty is whether beauty is subjective- located “in the eye of the beholder.” On the other hand, the objectivity of love, too, is not unheard of or unread of in the philosophical history. In fact, most ancient and medieval accounts, for the most part, located beauty outside of anyone’s particular experiences. However, the subjective narrative of beauty has been commonplace since the time of sophists. By the eighteenth century, Hume could write in his accounts:Beauty is no quality in things themselves: It exists merely in the mind which contemplates them; and each mind perceives a different beauty. One person may even perceive deformity, where another is sensible of beauty; and every individual ought to acquiesce in his own sentiment, without pretending to regulate those of others. (Hume 1757, 136)However, if we base the entire meaning of beauty on the subjective consciousness, the word itself loses all the importance, for we are not communicating anything when we call something beautiful except perhaps a positive personal attitude. Furthermore, although our judgments of things differ, isn’t it incredible how our appraisals coincide with appreciating the beauty of a perfect red rose, or a dramatic sunrise/sunset on a hillside? Any deviation in appreciating the beauty in these cases would often look perverse. Do we find the sunrise/sunset beautiful because they are truly beautiful or because the people around us have collectively and conventionally defined them as beautiful? Such sights do give us some pleasure. However, do we find pleasure in them because they are beautiful, or are they beautiful because we find pleasure in them? Augustine asks explicitly in De Veritate Religione: Are things beautiful because they give delight, or whether they give delight because they are beautiful? He emphatically chooses the second (Augustine, 247). Augustine’s objective explanation of beauty is complemented by the works of Plato and Plotinus in the Symposium and Enneads, respectively. They associate beauty to a response of love and desire but locate beauty itself in the realm of the Forms. Both of them in their works have clearly defined different forms that a “beautiful” object can take.Photo by: M PAlthough Plato and Aristotle disagree in other facets of beauty, they both regard the objectivity of beauty in the sense that it is not localized in the beholder’s response. The classic conception treats beauty as a matter of instantiating definite proportions among parts, sometimes expressed in mathematical ratios, like the “golden section.” One of such illustrations is in the work of Polykleitos. He adopted a specific proportion while sculpting ‘The Canon.’ In ancient philosophy, it is considered that one has to adopt the objective proportion to reproduce any beautiful price of art. Yet, the old convention does attribute some of the normative of beauty to the pleasurable experiences. For instance, Plotinus has:“This is the spirit that Beauty must ever induce: wonderment and a delicious trouble, longing, and love and a trembling that is all delight” (Plotinus 23, [Ennead 1, 3]).While the classic philosophers directed the pleasurable experience as an inadvertent outcome of beauty, the eighteenth-century philosophers regarded pleasure as not an effect but the origin of beauty. This diversion somewhat fueled the subjective narrative of beauty. Locke and other likeminded empiricists treated color (which is an essential locus of beauty), as a ‘phantasm’ of the mind, as a set of qualities dependent on a subjective response, located in the perceiving mind rather than of the world outside the mind. Without the perceivers, in this case, the beauty of an object would diminish in value. This was significantly substantiated by the argument that the beauty of a hillside sunrise/sunset is of no value for a blind person. Even the beauty of a specific object can change when viewed in the daytime or at night. Such variations are conspicuous in experiences of beauty as well.While the ancient and medieval works of literature often tend to make polarized arguments while defining beauty, the relatively modern literature often opt for a marriage of both the art and the philosophy of beauty. They appreciate both the objectivity and the subjectivity of it. For instance, G.E. Moore writes:“To say that a thing is beautiful is to say, not indeed that it is itself good, but that it is a necessary element in something which is: to prove that a thing is truly beautiful is to prove that a whole, to which it bears a particular relation as a part, is truly good” (Moore 1903, 201).Moore tries to explain the importance of the situation in which the object and the person experiencing are both ingrained. In line with the similar thought, Crispin Startwell, in his book Six Names of Beauty (2004), attributes beauty neither exclusively to the object nor the observer. He argues the beauty that we assign to the night sky is not solely because of the pleasure we derive from it. The presence of the night sky itself is pivotal in the creation of beauty. On the contrary, beauty would lose all its value in the absence of the perceiver. Hence, beauty is not merely created in the eyes of the beholder, nor is it inherently a characteristic of the object; the beauty is created through the juxtaposition and connection of the perceiver and the object.Please let me know your thoughts and feedback through comments!

Our conversation is reprinted below, edited only for clarity and space.JC: Hello, Fire Monkey. Thanks for agreeing to chat. Why don’t you explain a little bit about what you do.FM: Fyre MonkeJC: Excuse me?FM: It’s pronounced Fyre Monke.JC: That’s what I said.FM: No you said “Fire Monkey”, which is an allusion to a cousin of mine from Chinese mythology, more commonly known as “The Monkey King” aka Sun Wukong aka Son Goku. That’s cultural appropriation, and if you do it again I’m leaving the interview.JC: Umm…deepest apologies. Well, Fyre Monke, can you explain a little bit about what you do?FM: No problem, Joshua. Some of your readers may already be familiar with me, but to any newcomers who might be suffering under the poor fortune of not having been blessed with the knowledge of my grandeur, allow me to introduce myself. It is I, the illustrious Fyre Monke, destroyer of worlds, patron saint of lost causes, the chaos-bringer, lover of anarchy and justice, ardent supporter of those who struggle in the streets against tyranny. Also ardent supporter of those who struggle in the street against inconvenience. Alright, ardent supporter of people struggling in the streets for just about anything as long they’re not assholes or fascists. Well, sometimes assholes too, but that depends highly on context. Here, take my card.JC: Wow, you really wrote all that on a card…is that a picture of the Monkey King Sun Wukong on the back? I thought….FM: Look, let’s not get caught up in details. I believe you had some questions about policy and social issues?JC: Right, yes, let’s get to it. 2019 was a year of record civil unrest, and 2020 is following in that path. Some experts…FM: YES! IT’S BEAUTIFUL!JC: Err…did you just shoot flames out of your eyes?FM: Of course not, Please continue.JC: Some experts predict that 2021 will be even more fraught with social uprisings as the impacts of COVID-19 become more apparent and nations lift preventative lockdown measures. What do you think can be done to help prevent widespread unrest?FM: I’m sorry I don’t understand the question.JC: …FM:…JC:…FM: These roasted plantains are quite good. Thank you for inviting me here today.JC: Right. Next question. A global rise in populism and widespread growth of both conspiracy theories and disinformation networks have been an important topic of conversation in culture and media lately. Do you see this as a widespread problem preventing the encouragement and development of democracy in global society?FM: No.JC: I’m sorry, can you elaborate? Why not?FM: Look, information, dis-information, what’s the difference really when we get down to the bottom of the issue? I’m not concerned about “facts” and all this ‘blah blah blah’ you windbag journalists are always going on about. Democracy is simple, you smash the tyrannical hierarchy and then you let people live their lives. The details will sort themselves out.JC: Ah ok, so you would consider yourself a minarchist then?FM: Hell no. Labels and teams are for only suckers and windbags like you. I focus on the important bit, liberation and the creation of truly free peoples. Does this cafe serve tea?JC: Just herbal tea.FM: Perfect, i don’t believe in the existence of proper tea anyway. It’s a construct of an unjust society. Mind if I order a cup? You said you’re picking up the tab, no? I don’t carry money. I find it to be annoying.JC: Yes, of course, please. What would you say to people who posit that as these global social movements emerge and create connections and communications networks between one-another, forming what some refer and transnational solidarity, it becomes harder for States to to discredit them or lie about conditions on the ground?FM: Look, computers seem neat. They make cool glowy images and I quite like pornography, but technology is just silly toys humans made to feel better about themselves if you take a step back and really look at it. I mean, don’t get me wrong, there are some exceptions- fireworks for example, I like fireworks. And really really fast spaceships seem pretty neat. It would be cool to burn shit down on Mars. I would like to do that someday.What’s important here is smashing the tyrannical hierarchy. It’s like the people who are always telling me to read Peter Alex CroBumpkin..JC: I’m sorry do you mean Pyotr Alexeyevich Kropotkin?FM: That’s what I said, yes. anyway. All this “theory” is just rules, man. I dislike rules. I get to like page two and I want to reply, Sir, have you even considered burning shit down? I consider myself a monkey of action. You humans talk too much. More flame, less lame, that’s what I always say.JC: Fair enough. Final question: do you think it’s possible to solve the problem of scarcity inherent in market-based economies, or do you think that a better solution would be to try and build a society more focused on people than capital, and a follow-up. Do you think that hierarchies will still naturally emerge even in a stateless society?FM: OH MY GOD YOU’RE SO BORING! This is why you don’t have a girlfriend. Look, Joshua. Burn shit down. Just burn shit down. It’s simple. Freedom. Action. Anyway thanks for the chat, I have to get going though. I have a tindr date with a cute “mona” here in Bogota this evening.Luck with your boring ‘blah blah blah’ article. Chao!Joshua Collins is a freelance journalist and photographer based in Colombia.

Do Leftists Want Joe Biden to Lose?,https://medium.com/discourse/do-leftists-want-joe-biden-to-lose-756bf33f15e6?source=tag_archive---------5-----------------------,"Politics,Government,History,Political Science,2020 Presidential Race","Kyle Kylanski is arguably the most influential leftist with millions of followers between Twitter and YouTube.When it comes to current events, many leftist arguments originate with him. One of Kyle Kylanski’s central arguments is that he will not vote for Joe Biden because Joe Biden doesn’t support at least one-of-his-top-five-positions: “Medicare for All, free college, living wage, ending the wars, and UBI.” If Joe Biden supported one of those positions then Kyle Kylanski said he’d vote for him in 2020.Kyle Kylanski’s view is that he doesn’t want to keep rewarding the Democratic party with his vote because it signals to the party that they can continue to ignore leftist demands while taking leftist support for granted.But what is better? If Joe Biden gave 10%, 10%, 10%, 10%, 100% on each of those positions, or if he gave 50%, 50%, 50%, 50%, 50%?With the latter, leftists are getting more of their agenda through even though Joe Biden fails their ideological purity test on each issue.The truth is that Joe Biden is overall the most leftist Democratic nominee in American history with a running mate who has a Senate voting record further left than Bernie Sanders therefore many centrist Democrats believe they have moved far enough left to satisfy the leftist wing of the party.After all, some of the things Biden/Harris are running on are a $15 minimum wage, free public college for families making under $125,000, a universal housing voucher program, a public option, a $2 trillion dollar green energy plan, a $775 billion plan for caregiving, and a $700 billion “made in America” plan. Biden’s plans come to at least $10 trillion, which is three times the cost of what Hillary Clinton proposed in 2016.“You know what, Joe Biden will become the most progressive president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt. And that, in this moment, is what we need.” — Bernie SandersBut a lot of leftists who are persuaded by that platform still won’t vote for Joe Biden, somewhat paradoxically to Kyle Kylanski’s desire, because they feel he compromises too much!It’s not good enough he holds those positions today he should have held them 10 years ago! This is why even if Joe Biden did support Medicare-for-All there are still many on the left who wouldn’t vote for him because they don’t think he’d actually fight for it. I think this is a fair critique given that in Joe Biden’s previous presidential runs and throughout his long Senatorial career he was known more of as a centrist bipartisan backslapper by supporting such policies as a federal spending freeze and a balanced budget amendment.Ultimately, many leftists believe time is on their side.If Joe Biden wins in 2020 he’ll either seek reelection or have VP Kamala Harris take the ball from there, which could arguably stall the leftist agenda, but if Joe Biden loses then not only will it be easier for democratic socialists to get the nomination in 2024, but it’ll also be easier for them to win the presidency as it is the political norm for the country to change parties in the White House after 8 years.And not only that, but after 8 years of Trump and a more diverse electorate, leftists could be set for a landslide victory in 2024 and be able to push much more of their agenda through in a way that could be difficult with a non-democratic-socialist in the White House and a more evenly divided Senate.From a leftist perspective wouldn’t it, therefore, be better to wait until 2024 instead of Joe Biden making marginal gains now? During radical times, moderate success can be a liability. If Joe Biden wins, Republicans will be in a better position in 2024 to run the “change” candidate, i.e. somebody whose younger, more charismatic, more ideologically-pure, more ethnic, and more anti-establishment, such as the increasingly popular 2016 Republican runner-up Ted Cruz who currently has the #1 podcast in the country.Of course, it’s a big gamble to bet on 2024 (even for disillusioned conservatives in the reverse case) because if 2016 has taught us anything it’s that a lot can happen from now till then.And so although many leftists are not actively cheerleading for Trump to win in order to create their dream 2024 scenario because there are so many ways that Machevillian strategy could backfire it’s enough of a hope for many leftists to keep their pom poms at home.Dialogue & DiscourseNews and ideas worthy of discourse.Follow194 6 PoliticsGovernmentHistoryPolitical Science2020 Presidential Race194 claps194 claps6 responsesWritten byAnthony GalliFollowsocio-political polemic and essayist | www.AnthonyGalli.comFollowDialogue & DiscourseFollowNews and ideas worthy of discourse.

"<strong class=""bz"">MY FIRST NYC VOTER REGISTRATION CASE</strong>",https://medium.com/3streams/my-first-nyc-voter-registration-case-21c142ef938e?source=tag_archive---------6-----------------------,"Voting Rights,Voter Suppression Laws,New York Election,Political Science,Elections","By: KEN SHERRILLToday is National Voter Registration Day.Photo by Elliott Stallion on UnsplashThis reminds me of my first experience as an expert witness at a trial. In the spring of 1969 — my second year at Hunter College in New York City — my colleague Blanche Blank came up to me in the hallway outside the department office and asked me if I did the kind of statistical analysis that could be useful in a voter registration case. I replied that Profs. Don Matthews and Jim Prothro, my University of North Carolina dissertation advisors, had testified in many voter registration cases, usually about barriers to Black registration in the South, and that I thought that I could do the same sort of work. After all, I thought that was something that political scientists routinely did.Blanche told me that a friend of hers, Burt Neuborne of the ACLU National, was working on a case about New York’s bizarre voter registration laws and that he needed someone like me as an expert witness. I was excited by the idea of doing it. I thought it was another rite of passage into being a real political scientist, a part of growing up as a professional.New York’s system at the time was truly bizarre.Anyone who met the age, residency, and literacy test requirements could go to their county Board of Elections — one in each borough in a city of 8,000,000 people — and register to vote until about Labor Day. After that, voter registration took place at local polling places, but only for three days in early October. After that, it was impossible to register to vote. Surely, that system had the effect of depressing the vote, of denying many citizens of their right to vote. I was really excited about having the chance to tear that stupid barrier down.The plan was very simple.All I needed to do was to get each state’s deadline for voter registration and each state’s turnout rate. Then I analyzed the turnout rate in comparison with the number of days between the close of registration and Election Day. That allowed me to estimate the percent of additional voters that came with each additional day of registration. (This was quite a learning experience for me. I had no idea that some states had same-day registration.) Anyway, I computed the percent of voting age citizens who would be added to the rolls if there were no September shutdown and the percent of additional citizens who would be enfranchised if we were to extend voter registration by a week or two.The results were quite substantial.Other than asserting that the state had the power to set the deadlines whenever it wanted, New York’s only defense was that the Board of Elections needed the downtime in order to process the registration forms. Ultimately, the state’s only defense was bureaucratic incompetence. Fortunately, the ACLU had an ace up its sleeve. David Dinkins, who would go on to become Mayor, chaired the New York City Board of Elections and he eloquently testified that the Board would have no difficulty processing the additional registration forms. The judge ruled in our favor and thousands more New Yorkers were registered to vote.Doing this testimony turned out to be much more than a professional rite of passage. Most political scientists never have the experience of using their professional skills to do some real good for the public at large. The thrill that comes from doing this is immeasurable. I went on to do another voter registration case in New York with Burt Neuborne and David Dinkins and I became friends. I went on to work with the ACLU and Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund on LGBTQ rights cases culminating with a Supreme Court victory in Romer v. Evans. Those cases will be the subject of later postings.Addendum on a 1970 failureThe next year, Blanche, Burt, and I were back in federal court to attack another crazy aspect of New York’s election law. At the time, enrolled voters were allowed to cast absentee ballots in the general election but not in nominating primaries.Our plaintiff was a soldier on duty in Vietnam who wanted to vote for Al Lowenstein, who was running for the Democratic congressional nomination as an anti-war candidate against a machine-backed incumbent who was a supporter of the war. I was prepared to testify about why enrolled members of a political party’s right to vote in party primaries were entitled to the same protections as enrolled voters in general elections.The judge may or may not have had any connections to the Brooklyn machine, but he threw the case out and I wasn’t allowed to testify. I haven’t been able to take a “win some/lose some” approach to people being denied their fundamental rights. I think that the issue was resolved by legislative action in later years. If that soldier survived the war, still lived in New York, and still was an enrolled Democrat, he’d be able to vote absentee in Democratic primaries fifty years later.3StreamsA blog about politics, policy, and ideasFollow5 Voting RightsVoter Suppression LawsNew York ElectionPolitical ScienceElections5 claps5 clapsWritten byKenneth SherrillFollowProfessor Emeritus of political science at Hunter College, CUNY and Graduate School, CUNY.

Science,International Relations,Power","在上一篇文中我們稍微透過三個陷阱定律來暸解中國目前的處境和地位，如果還沒有看過的可以點選連結：兩大強權的角力下，臺灣該怎麼做？（上）來觀看。本篇文會聚焦在中美的關係以及臺灣可行的做法來進行探討。Photo by Vladislav Klapin on Unsplash前言近期逢迪士尼電影〈花木蘭〉在臺灣各大電影院上映，其中女主角劉亦菲挺港警的言論頗受爭議，引起社會上紛紛出現抵制觀看〈花木蘭〉的聲音，要與港人站在同一陣線，拒絕中國的大外宣；另外在該片結尾致謝中也出現「中國共產黨新疆維吾爾自治委員會宣傳部門」此極具爭議性的組織，該組織曾被指控對維吾爾族進行強迫勞動和絕育等恐造成族群滅絕和文化消失的手段，更興起了大眾對於中國大外宣的注意和反感，但諷刺的是，目前〈花木蘭〉在台灣的票房已達約3800萬元，票房排名高居世界第二，說明了諸如此類的抵制、拒看等消極性的被動手段，無法有效的阻擋中國的大外宣政策。更不用說年初的總統大選所受到各種網路滲透、攻擊等威脅國家安全的案件層出不窮，以及時常聽到個資洩漏的資安問題，這些有關「資訊」的議題也許是我們現在都應該要有所警覺和提防的，以下我們會進行討論。中美戰爭？直接戰爭？超限戰？Photo by Kevin Ku on Unsplah首先，我想先來探討「資訊」所帶來的影響與威脅。根據中國軍旅作家喬良和人民解放軍空軍大校王湘穗所著的《超限戰》一書，未來的戰爭模式很有可能導向超限戰的局勢。超限戰即意味著超越傳統範圍手段的新型戰爭形式，包括資訊戰、貿易戰、新恐怖主義、科技戰以及生態戰。超限戰是可以透過不流血手段來達到傳統戰爭可以達到的效果，強調「軍事技術」、「科技發展」在未來戰爭的地位是不可取代的。除此之外，喬良也指出「戰爭泛化」是必然的：網路戰、資源戰、媒體戰、金融戰、文化戰等領域都是未來的重點戰場，戰爭範圍已經遠遠超出傳統軍人的能力範疇。這本書不僅精準預測美國九一一攻擊事件的發生，在恐攻發生後掀起一波討論的浪潮，也證實了現在臺灣和美國正面臨到的問題：媒體戰與資訊戰的攻防早就開始。我們把時間拉回到2016年的11月8號，當天正舉辦美國第58屆的總統選舉，並且由共和黨的川普和其搭檔彭斯以306張選舉人票贏過希拉蕊和凱恩的232票，成為美國總統。這樣的結果令美國主流媒體一時之間難以置信，堂堂美國總統竟然是由非典型政治人物出身的川普當選，怎麼會這樣呢？我們再把時間拉到2018年的11月24號，這天是臺灣第7次的直轄市長和縣市長選舉，由國民黨所派出的候選人韓國瑜以89萬票贏下長年綠色執政的高雄市，終結民進黨在高雄20年的連續執政。同樣的非典型政治人物，同樣的贏得了一場出人意表的選戰，也許你會覺得可能就是人民覺得日子過得太苦了，想要換一個做做看；或是這些候選人的口才好，把未來美好願景講得極具吸引力；又或是他們的政策真的略勝其他候選人一籌，但我個人認為，比起上述的幾個理由，這些選戰結果跟選民所接收到的「資訊」有著更深層的連結。為什麼這麼說呢？一個很顯而易見的理由就是：你會每天關注候選人的政見發表或是造勢場合說過的話嗎？當然一定會有些許政治效能感極高的人定期暸解這些候選人的消息，但很明顯的是這種人在社會上並不佔多數，人民更傾向於每天瀏覽社群軟體：臉書、推特、Instagram和各種網路新聞平台，從自己既有的舒適圈和朋友圈中獲取相關消息，需要注意的是，這容易產生在社會心理學上所謂「團體激化」以及「團體迷思」的問題發生，前者意謂著團體討論傾向強化最強勢的意見，使得最後的決定比原本的決定更為偏頗；後者則說明團體內過度在意共識，犧牲了批判思考的精神，這會導致人們對於接收資訊的光譜將越來越窄，越來越難以得到不同觀點的看法，尤其是演算法進步神速，逐漸能夠區分出更細微的團體差異，並投遞更加精確的廣告，讓人們去相信他們所看到的狹小框架內就是社會上的主流趨勢，引發「同溫層效應」。所以真正讓人們去認識和認同某一候選人，我認為多半是靠著社群網絡的媒介來獲取的，這也使得資訊的地位在近年來逐漸提升，並成為各國在軍事上的主要佈局議題。再者，我想針對中美直接戰爭的可能性來進行探討。我認為中美在未來不會有直接且全面性的軍事衝突，其原因可以分為以下四點：第一，地理位置來看，美中為處於太平洋的兩端，兩國在領土、海洋上沒有衝突因子，發生軍事衝突的機率較低，在這邊我們只單純討論國土的問題，不考慮代理人戰爭的情況，兩國在邊界上沒有交集的地區，較不容易產生近期在中印邊界拉達克主權爭議區的「班公錯」（Pangong Tso）南側高地的衝突情況，；第二，由自然資源觀點來看，兩國均屬擁有相當豐富的天然資源蘊藏量，因此兩國較不易因為資源匱乏而產生衝突，川普也在競選期間不段強調美國將會致力於開發頁岩油田，確保國家石油穩定提供；第三，根據金德爾伯格（Charles P．Kindleberger）的霸權穩定論一說，霸權的運作必須建立在提供霸權公共財之上，包含提供開放市場、長期借貸、維持匯率穩定以及確保世界總體經濟政策協調，若無法維持這些共同利益，則此霸權將衰弱而被另一興起的霸權取代之。根據〈2049百年馬拉松：中國稱霸全球的祕密戰略〉一書中可以得知中國顯然有心於成為繼美國之後的另一霸權，但由人民幣在世界的流通率仍遠低於美國可見，中國目前要能夠持續提供霸權公共財的能力還有待商榷。因此在整體經濟實力超越美國時，中國取代美國霸權的地位才較有勝算，但目前看來原本就已經脆弱的中國經濟體加上新冠肺炎疫情的肆虐，此一前景在短期之內應該無法看見；第四，各國的武器科技越發先進、致命，在中美皆有核彈頭的處境下，承襲了冷戰以來相互毀滅保證的嚇阻效果，避免雙方在軍事上的輕舉妄動。綜合上述四個理由，我認為在中美爆發直接戰爭的可能性在近期內還是偏低的。然而這並不代表中美兩大世界強權就不會有所較勁，自2018年起的中美貿易戰就可以很明顯地看到兩國在經濟上的斡旋與交火，一直到近期世界衛生組織在疫情處理的失職引起川普不滿並宣布將停止世衛組織的金援，中國旋即跳出來表示將承接資金的援助，同樣也能看到兩國在國際組織地位上的爭奪戰。我們再將鏡頭拉到這兩個月來臺海的緊張情勢，共軍9月10號在西南海域舉行聯合軍演，並遭到臺灣軍方指控其軍機多次跨越西南防空識別區的界線，具有挑性意味且威脅臺灣安全；而美國艦隊在南海也集結了強大軍力，在今年6月也進行羅斯福號(USS Theodore Roosevelt CVN-71)及尼米茲號(USS Nimitz CVN-68)雙航母的軍事演習，向中國傳達其在臺海附近的強大實力，具有威懾意義。由此可見臺海或將成為新的代理人戰場也說不定，這是我們在今明兩年需要非常注意的地方。綜合上述，我認為中國與美國的全面性戰爭的機會較低，兩國的主戰場將會轉往超限戰的範疇邁進，尤其是以資訊戰的形式展開機會較大；又或是進行在第三地作戰的代理人戰爭，避免本國國土的直接傷亡。但無可否認的是，中國做為一新興的霸權挑戰者，它對於現今霸權－美國的權力抗衡，在未來仍有許多斡旋和衝突的空間與可能性；又或是中國內部掉入塔西佗陷阱，進而引發轉移注意力戰爭，種種的情況也值得我們更深入的思考。臺灣的因應方式？討論完了中國內部情況以及中美關係後，我們將探討臺灣在具體的因應方式上有什麼做法。臺灣自國民政府遷台以來，一直處於中國和美國兩大強權的關注焦點，現今國內兩大黨也各自被視為兩國在臺灣的代理人：民進黨親美；國民黨親中，而臺灣的民意也粗略可以分為這兩派。在本節我將以三個面向討論臺灣在未來可以因應的方式：分別為「中美貿易戰下的戰略調整」、「資訊戰的防禦」以及「外交型態的改變」。（一）中美貿易戰下的戰略調整2019年底，聯合國在11月5日公布一研究報告，提到了中美貿易戰下臺灣是最大受益者，因為美國從中國減少進口的350億美元的產品，其中210億被臺灣、墨西哥、歐盟等國家的出口所替代，可以看出台灣的產業在國際具有極高的競爭力，尤以7月時英特爾宣布採取其他廠商的晶圓消息一出，台積電的股價隨即亮燈漲停，說明臺積電在世界晶圓製造與研發的地位向上攀升，但在中美貿易戰情勢尚未明朗之時，加上新冠肺炎疫情重挫世界經濟，引起全球經濟的不確定性，臺灣可以有以下幾點的策略參考：第一，政府應該更加留意新台幣匯率的穩定，讓臺灣中小型企業能夠有效降低出口的匯率損失風險，畢竟臺灣仍是屬於中小型企業較多的國家；第二，政府應該協助業者強化以臺灣為核心的全球佈局，提供臺商回流的獎勵機制，穩固臺灣在科技產業的地位；第三，政府應結合新南向政策，鼓勵業者增加與東南亞市場的連結和合作，經營東亞產業鍊；第四，政府可提供優良的國內投資環境和法令規範，吸引海外臺商和外國產業對臺投資。（二）資訊戰的防禦資訊戰屬於混合戰（Hybrid war）的一環，其特色在於難以被歸責或追究，行動者傾向採取難以取證，或是刻意混淆的手法，目的是為了被追究時方便否認，具有「易否性」（Plausible Deniability）。從俄羅斯運用混合戰攻下克里米亞，以及俄羅斯介入美國大選，分裂美國社會等事件看出資訊戰的威力甚於以往的常規戰。中國也同樣運用其大外宣政策，利用武器化的公關戰攻擊臺灣今年年初的總統選舉，許多中國公司會利用社交網站和收購的媒體，即所謂的內容農場，進行一次又一次的炒作與散播，逐步改變群眾的看法，甚至有新聞媒體高調宣傳和平統一。臺灣正處在中國資訊戰的最前線，我國應正視資訊戰的問題，更積極地採取防禦措施和反攻之道，以下三點策略可供參考：一、詳盡研究資訊的流通，建立數位鑑識系統，釐清對方攻擊的策略和戰術；二、強化民眾資安意識，加強相關法規，保護個人隱私資料不被竊取；三、強化人民的媒體識讀能力，深化民主人權思維，養成思辨與查證的能力，這是最為長遠的目標，但卻也是最重要的，因為中國資訊戰並不會停止，我們必須要學會分辨真假消息的能力，才不會被風向帶著走。（三）外交型態的改變適逢新冠肺炎疫情的衝擊，讓臺灣完善的醫療體系以及優秀的防疫成績被世界所關注，許多國家紛紛效仿臺灣在抗疫上的作法，我國也順勢推行口罩外交，並分享防疫經驗，與世界各國合作促進全人類的健康安全。除了在抗疫上臺灣受到國際媒體關注，使得加入世界衛生組織的議題有英、美、德、法、日等國支持，重新進入國際組織的目標變得較為明朗時，我們仍應該放眼未來，積極建立國與國之間的關係，強化國家安全。目前的可行方法有二：一為「數位外交」，透過社群媒體的倡議活動，替臺灣和不同國家的人民搭起友誼的橋樑，屬於公民外交的一種；第二，巧外交（Smart Diplomacy），跳脫傳統外交「國與國」的思維，以更包容性的國際合作發展思維，整合外交、教育、科技、經貿、醫療與人權等各部會資源，以及結合官方與民間資源，針對不同開發中國家需求，量身打造跨部門合作的國際發展策略，才能使臺灣擺脫外交困境，創造以人為本的自由民主價值，成為全人類發展過程的重要角色。總結最近國際事件頻傳，很多與臺灣息息相關的事件我們都應該多加關注，然而我認為臺灣目前的主流媒體對於國際世界的著墨並不多，國人不容易接收到相關資訊，在社會上的討論度也不高，這是相當危險也相當可惜的事，身為長期與中美雙方保持高度的經濟合作，並面對中國武力威脅的第一線國家，如何認知到臺灣在國際的地位並保護自己是很重要的，我們並不如以色列具有非常強烈的民族意識和對美影響力，這也使得如何發揮臺灣的長處贏得國際認同顯得更為重要，這也是我在寫文章搜集資料時希望可以去暸解的，強迫自己透過國際事件來認識臺灣，如果我們自己都不願意認識自己生長的土地，不願意去認同我們的國家，那你還期望誰會來認同呢？總結來說，我認為認知到臺灣在國際的地位和長處，並與國際接軌，是我們必須要做的事，不應該一直處於被動的地位，被其他國家牽著鼻子走，不論是親中或是親美都一定各有優劣，完全認知自己的國家才能有一個較為宏觀的判斷；才不會因為兩黨的執政輪替導致對外政策不斷改變、移轉；才能有一個能夠走得長遠的路，也因為這樣才有機會找到我們真正的定位。如果有任何問題或是不完善的地方也請讀到這裡的大家不吝給予指教，希望未來在寫作上可以持續的進步！參考文獻臺灣國際合作發展概念書－台灣海外援助發展聯盟倡議（林子倫，2016）霸權穩定論與歐巴馬政府的亞太戰略發展（賴榮偉，2013）臺灣面臨新型態資訊戰，不僅是「網軍」那麼簡單（林雨蒼，2019）資訊戰，然後呢？《台灣產業因應之道》美中貿易戰對台灣產業的影響與機會《操弄：劍橋分析事件大揭祕》：身為歐巴馬鐵粉，我卻掌握了川普新帝國的鑰匙「劍橋分析」事件是什麼？一文搞懂免費心理測驗背後的故事班公錯肉搏戰：印中邊境二度衝突，印度軍「藏族流亡戰士」陣亡Written

We know Trump is racist. But can we empirically prove it?,https://medium.com/@batadaisy/we-know-trump-is-racist-but-can-we-empirically-prove-it-8d92992cabf0?source=tag_archive---------8-----------------------,"Trump,Racism,Twitter,Political Science,Discourse Analysis","Trump’s Racist Twitter: A discourse analysis of the construction of the ‘dangerous’ immigrant and Trump as America’s saviour“In moments of crisis, people are willing to hand over great deals of power to anyone who claims to have a magic cure.” — Naomi Klein, The Shock DoctrineThe North American relationship with immigration has never been an easy one. Founded by immigrants and built by slaves, public discourse on immigration has always lent itself to a more conservative angle. There has always been a steady stream of migration in and out of the U.S., from all over the world, but from the 1960s onwards that number has been enlarging, with what is sometimes referred to as increased ‘browning’ of society, referring to more migration from Asia, Africa and the Middle East, in contrast to the White of European-Christian cultural heritage majority of the country. In the 2016 election, immigration had somehow taken a large role in Republican nominee’s campaigns. Whether through blatant xenophobic language (“they’re rapists”, Presidential Announcement speech June 16th, 2015) or veiled metaphorical constructions (“some, I assume, are good people”, ibid.), the successful Republican nominee Donald J. Trump put anti-immigration rhetoric, and his ‘Border Wall’, centre stage.Trump’s Border Wall was first mentioned in his Presidential announcement speech as a way to stop what he posited as immigrants “flooding” into the country on the southern border between the U.S. and Mexico. And when he was elected President, many of his most controversial policies were related to immigration. The administration, for example, has been criticised for Executive Order 13769, titled Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States, commonly dubbed as the ‘Muslim Ban’, in which countries of majority Muslim populations were temporarily banned from entering the U.S. Family separations on the border have been widely criticised, as have Trump supporters, who chanted “send her back” (July 17th, 2019, Greenville, North Carolina) in response to Trump’s ongoing conflict with Ilhan Omar, the first Muslim-identifying congresswoman of Minnesota’s fifth district.In his Presidential Announcement speech on June 16th, 2015, Trump conflated immigration with criminality, saying that “when Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best […] They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. […] It’s coming from more than Mexico. It’s coming from all over South and Latin America, and it’s coming probably — probably — from the Middle East.” And from that day on has persisted with a narrative that immigration (specifically from “shithole countries” (Dawsey, 2018)) poses an immediate danger to the lives and livelihoods of Americans.Populism, a shift in the Overton Window, a rise in the ‘alt-right’ or a reaction to the Obama Presidency are all spurious elements in the relationship between the Trump administration and anti-immigrant policies. Trump, like other Presidents before him, has stoked uncertainty, fear and anxiety around immigration through his rhetoric. This research analyses how Trump uses anti-immigrant discourse on Trump’s Twitter feed, @realDonaldTrump, to answer the question of why he might do so. It looks at instances of inflammatory language with words such as ‘aliens’, ‘anchor babies’ and ‘illegals’, and metaphorical constructions of instances of fear-mongering and constructions of immigration as a threat to an American way of life, in conjunction with the construction of Trump as the only person willing and/or able to address this (unproven) crisis.Trump has existed within the public eye throughout most of his life. In 1971 he took over the family’s real estate business, re-naming it The Trump Organisation, and subsequently produced several televised beauty pageants and became best known for his book The Art of the Deal and hosting reality tv show The Apprentice. He is the sole President to have reached office without first serving either in any public office or in the military, but was instead a celebrity before his inauguration, making his relationship to social media and to the public a particularly unique phenomenon to investigate.Twitter presents a unique angle on Trump’s rhetoric, as expanded upon in the Literature Review: his tweets seem to be unfiltered by speech writers, coming directly from him; tweets force the user to be concise, being limited to 280 characters (previously 140) and thus allows us to avoid the rambling nature of his speeches and public appearances; they are regularly the subject of extensive news coverage; and Trump is an experienced Twitter user, having posted frequently since joining in 2009. The influence of social media in the 2016 election has since come under intense scrutiny after allegations that Cambridge Analytica harvested the data of over 50 million Facebook users in order to better their marketing research for the Trump Presidential campaign (Rosenberg, Confessore & Cadwalldr, 2018), although the nature of the influence of Twitter on public opinion is still unclear, making research into social media all the more pressing.A dialogue on Trump will always, inevitably, lead to a discussion of populism. It has been found that anger is a significant driver in support for populism (Rico, Guinjoan, Anduiza, 2016). Populism has also been found to define national identity by a process of negation, naming a threat (recently more frequently immigration) or what is wrong with those outside of the ideology, forming sovereign identity on the determination that ‘we’ are not like ‘them’ (Gimenez & Schwartz, 2016). This research investigates whether Trump harnesses anger and anxiety in combination with the creation of a sovereign homogenous group, toward immigration and ‘outsiders’.It is clear that increasing support for the right globally has had an influence on the discourse of immigration and the nature of nationality and nationalism. What this research hopes to clarify is whether anti-immigrant rhetoric from Trump is solely playing to this trend or if it functions as a catalyst for feelings of insecurity in the electorate, reinforcing the ‘need’ for harsher immigration control and thus a candidate or President willing to implement it.Trump’s tweets have been the subject of quantitative scholarly enquiry, but this will be one of the earlier studies of his tweets through discourse and qualitative analysis (Pain & Chen, 2019). Much of the scholarly analysis of Trump’s Twitter has been focussed on the form of the tweets (Gross, 2016; Pain & Chen, 2019; et al.) or predicting voting patterns, opinion and sentiment (Tumasjan et al. 2010). This research finds a carefully constructed and maintained effort to create an adversary in the form of those migrating to America, positioning Trump as “the lone outsider who can save the country” (Pain & Chen, 2019) and deliberately employing positive self-representation and negative other-presentation (Kreis, 2017). Theoretically, we draw on Van Dijk’s method of discourse analysis for the research, and investigate previous research on Twitter in the literature review (Pain & Chen, Hong & Nadler et al.), plus theories of disaster capitalism (Klein) and collective, biological and economic insecurity (Lorey & Butler) in the discussion as to theorising the why of the research question.We start by reviewing research on Twitter’s relationship to democracy, populism and politics in general, in combination with previous research on Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric and the nature of Trump’s Twitter discourse. We also review theories of discourse analysis in relation to social media. We then present the expectations and theories of the research, before mapping the methods used and the results. In the discussion we theorise on the paper’s limitations and possible future avenues, as well as the implications for the research and touch upon theories on the results.1.1 Coded Language on TwitterPrevious scholarly research has been heavily focussed on how Trump has used Twitter in aggressive, clumsy and/or absurd ways (Franck, 2019), whether that is through taunts and tirades (Gross et al., 2016), spelling mistakes such as the infamous “covfefe” incident (@realDonaldTrump, May 31st, 2017, 12:06) or how he consistently ends tweets with an emotive word or phrase, such as “sad!” (@realDonaldTrump, May 7th, 2019, 20:15). Very little scholarly attention has been paid to the theory that Trump may use Twitter more prepensely. The paper thus theorises that initially Trump created an “expert language” (Pain & Chen, 2018) that invited many Americans who felt ignored, shunned or forgotten into his inner circle by ‘speaking’ to them through Twitter.Research using social media is increasingly popular among social scientists (Fiesler, 2019). However, studying information from a social media platform like Twitter comes with methodological and conceptual challenges, such as sampling biases arising or vague or unrepresentative sampling frames, as Zeynep Tufekci notes, “the socio-cultural complexity of user behaviour aimed at algorithmic invisibility (such as subtweeting, mock-retweeting, use of “screen captures” for text, etc.) further complicate interpretation of big data social media.” (Tufekci, 2014, p.1). This, combined with analysis of a public figure whose tweets are frequently posted by campaign or administration staff (and thus cannot be wholly assigned to Trump himself) make quantitative analysis of Twitter complex. Therefore, this research, while using some quantitative analysis in order to extract patters within large sums of data, mainly focusses on a qualitative analysis.Twitter has been instrumental in creating a new kind of discourse — a situation in which users speak not directly to each other (unless through responding to each others tweets on a ‘thread’ or via direct, private messages) but broadcasting their speech to their followers and to the wider world in general — as if someone were standing in the street, announcing their opinions. Users are limited to 280 characters (previously 140) within which they must express themselves. Using the “@“ symbol, users can tag or mention other users, and the “#” symbol creates a link to a thread, so that every mention of the hash-tagged word is connected. The hashtag has been especially prolific in marketing and campaigning, in that it reduces a meme to a bitesize hashtag, already connected to a wider context or discussion. For example, the hashtag #LockHerUp is recognisable as a reference to Trump’s ongoing criticism of the handling of the Hillary Clinton email scandal in which 20,000 documents were hacked from John Podesta, Clinton’s campaign chair (Wikileaks, 2016) and his insistence that she should be in jail, regardless of the assurance by James Comey, former FBI Director, that there had been no criminal act (Yuhas et al., 2016).1.2 Truth, Lies and the TwitterscapeTweets have been found to be a form of “discourse which help to create and reproduce systems of social meaning” (Fran Tonkiss, 1998, p.245). There is, on Twitter and in a wider social context, a social construction of discourse specific to members of social circles. In the same way that youths from London have a different language of slang than youths from Manchester, so do members of political spheres on Twitter. Neo-nazis have developed a coded language online that involves meanings behind the use of symbols, for example using an ‘echo’ or triple parentheses, “((( )))” to draw attention to a Jewish name (Hess, 2016). The paper argues that Trump also creates a system of coded language through his tweets, and that he continues to do so successfully; “Crooked Hillary” for example, is a phrase that has been repeated 334 times on Twitter as of the writing of this paper (TrumpTwitterArchive.com). In regard to this conceptual phrase, it is irrelevant if Hillary Clinton is actually “crooked” — followers understand that the phrase is linked to the narrative that Clinton is too close to Wall Street, and thus the same as every other politician before her, except, supposedly, Trump. Consistently associating Clinton’s name with the concept of being “crooked” thus tries to serve multiple purposes; cementing Trump as a populist, ‘anti-big government’ politician; undermining her credibility; and reinforcing the concept that is, fundamentally, just Trump’s opinion, as a socially accepted truth. It is through the development of a coded system that Trump has created his own expert language, the function of which is threefold: “It marks out a field of knowledge; it confers membership; and it bestows authority” (Tonkiss, 1998, p.247).In 2016 the Rand Corporation published an article titled The Russian “Firehose of Falsehood” Propaganda Model. In it, they theorise that President Vladimir Putin and others use a technique of repeatedly and unashamedly lying to the public in order to convince them that these lies were true. They found that not only did it not matter whether a lie contradicted objective reality, repeating a lie forces the viewer to engage in its existence and thus provide it with validity, reducing the concept of ‘truth’ to opinion. It has been found that subjects attitudes towards the target of a lie got worse even after the lie was debunked (Thorson, 2013) and that a falsehood is considered more ethical to tell if it aligns with the subject’s political preferences (Effron, 2018). Trump is quoted on July 25th, 2018 at the Veterans of Foreign Wars National Convention in Kansas City, Missouri as saying “just remember, what you’re seeing and what you’re reading is not what’s happening. Just stick with us, don’t believe that crap that you’re seeing with these people, the fake news”. This paper thus approaches anti-immigrant rhetoric in Trump’s Twitter with skepticism, choosing to let the numbers indicated by research speak as to the situation of immigration in the U.S. rather than solely information disseminated by the Trump administration.It can be theorised that Trump’s falsehoods serve as a filter for loyalty, interchangeable with a sense of ‘faith’; or that followers blindly trust him; or that they are indifferent to falsehoods as they believe every politician lies. When Trump has targeted something, it does not matter what evidence he uses to back himself up and whether this evidence is in fact debunked — the persistent attitude toward the subject remains the same for his followers (Effron, 2018). In discourse analysis, “language is seen not simply as a neutral medium for communicating information, but as a domain in which our knowledge of the social world is actively shaped.” (Tonkiss, 1998, p.245) It deconstructs language to understand it not as a way to transparently present the truth, but a way to construct and organise social reality, in a manner in which “social identities are formed” (Tonkiss, 1998, p.246). Thus, the analysis of his Twitter feed is not an exercise in fact-checking but rather an exercise in noticing trends and patterns that shape the narrative of focus — immigration. His Twitter feed can be seen as a culmination of all that he says in public; ideas and concepts perhaps taking form as and when he says them, the most pertinent (or those which garner the most applause) being reinforced through tweets.1.3 Twitter, Democracy and TransparencyTwitter can be used as an instrument for increased participation and democracy (Pain & Chen, 2019), but has not thus far been proven to shape public opinion, either positively or negatively (Hong & Nadler, 2011). Whether Twitter is causal or transformative in participatory democracy is still up for debate (Pain & Chen, 2019), and its influence on public feeling (whether it incites or encourages anti-immigrant sentiment, for example) has been hard to study up until the presidency of Trump, in which his tweets are not only consumed by his followers but widely disseminated by the media on both the left and the right (Gross & Johnson, 2016), functioning firstly as free advertising and secondly as news-stories within themselves (Pain & Chen, 2019; Gross & Johnson, 2016; Kreis, 2017).Twitter seems to create a space within which political figures can communicate closely with users, without the middle-woman of the press or media (Kreis, 2019). It has been found that Twitter has been used by Presidents and presidential candidates other than Trump as a means through which to spread information and opinion (Ross & Rivers, 2018) rather than to engage with other users or colleagues.Trump’s use of Twitter has been found to use an informal, direct and provocative style to construct the concept of a homogenous people and homeland threatened by immigration (Kreis, 2017). It allows Trump to appear unfiltered (Pain & Chen, 2019), and it is this idea that is key in understanding Trump’s larger discourse. In line with populist tradition, Trump has bolstered an image of himself as a man of the people (Canovan, 1999), claiming to be a businessman who worked his way to become the most powerful person in the country. Arguably it is his history as a public persona and tv personality that has helped justify alleged efforts to “drain the swamp” (October 17th 2016, Trump campaign press release, since deleted) of the political elite, being the first President who has served neither in public office nor the military before serving as President.His tweets have been found to be mainly conversational; he does not often cite reputable news sources, facts or figures and consistently uses language of “incivility” by consistently writing in capital letters or personally attacking others (Pain & Chen, 2019), with a more personal approach than those of other public officials, up until he announced his candidacy, at which point fellow candidates changed their approaches to reflect his (Gross et al. 2016). His manner on and off social media consistently appeared unfiltered; it seemed clear that he handled his own Twitter rather than campaign staff; he frequently went off script when speaking in public; and repeatedly derides efforts to maintain a professional dialogue, insisting that he doesn’t “have time for total political correctness” (Trump, GOP Primary Debate, Cleveland, August 6th, 2015). It is this last element that is the most divisive — and for which his supporters have the clearest rebuttal. They would rather a candidate or President who was unfiltered, and by implication, trustworthy, than a President who only shows a public image and keeps the rest of their thoughts and actions private. This is not to say that Trump is actually trustworthy, but rather that his unfiltered discourse only serves to reinforce his image of a man of the people and thus outside of the political elites.As much as negative and provocative language may produce results and therefore be considered a conscious strategy by politicians, it is also likely to be a product of intuition and prior experience (Gross & Johnson, 2016). This is where the gap in the literature lies in that campaign tone and discourse on Twitter have previously been treated in scholarly research as explanatory variables rather than investigating the driving factors to use said discourses and/or rhetoric (Gross & Johnson, 2016). This research aims to dissect how Trump uses anti-immigrant discourse on Twitter in order to shed light on why he might do so.1.4 The Good ImmigrantAnti-immigration rhetoric centred on the conflation of immigrant status with criminality has been widely debunked. Incarcerated Immigrants in 2016: Their numbers, demographics and Countries of Origin by Michelangelo Landgrave and Alex Nowrasteh uses American Community Survey data from the U.S. census bureau to analyse incarcerated people and their immigrant or native status. They find evidence that shows immigrant status (whether legal or not) actually reduces the likelihood of criminal behaviour in relation to their share of the population. Nonetheless, it has been theorised that from the moment that Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act that conservative whites have been leaving the Democratic Party (Favreau, 2018) and that politics has become increasingly more racialised, up to and including the Trump administration. Former President Barrack Obama’s campaign and administration was, with the help of Trump, constantly discussed in relation to his race; his father being Muslim, the “birther” theories (as of the writing of this paper Trump had tweeted about Obama’s birth certificate 22 times, TrumpTwitterArchive.com), his middle name being Hussein etc. The majority of white people in the U.S. voted against Obama in both elections (Favreau, 2018) including in blue states like California. It has been theorised then, that racial bigotry has always existed within American politics; but Trump has willingly “poured gasoline” (Favreau, 2018) on an issue that other politicians have avoided. Even so, immigration is repeatedly and consistently conflated with criminality and more than that, the concept of “line-cutting” (Edsall, 2016) in which white Americans feel unjustly neglected for the sake of affirmative action, in which immigrants, women, people of colour and other minorities supposedly jump ahead of them in the queue for the American dream (Inglehart & Norris, 2016), moving voters away from the post-materialist boom post World War II (Inglehart & Norris, 2017) and towards populist politics in favour of nationalism. This paper thus takes anti-immigration discourse to be ill-informed and largely false.2 Research design/MethodologyThis research looked at a total of 11,406 tweets from the Twitter account @realDonaldTrump from the day that Donald Trump announced his candidacy for the Presidency on June 16th, 2015 up until the 16th of August 2019, when this research was closed, as collected by Brendan Brown at TrumpTwitterArchive.com. This included 25 sent from a Blackberry mobile device between June 16th, 2015 and July 11th, 2015; 2,118 from an Android mobile device between June 16th, 2015 and March 25th, 2017; and 11,406 tweets from an iPhone mobile device between June 16th 2015 and August 16th 2019 (see Table 1). These tweets were filtered to removed retweets and direct messages to other users using the “.@“ function, so as to remove potential interference of irrelevant data. It was also important to note that not all tweets can be proven to be written by Trump himself as he has had multiple people in his campaign and administration with access to his account. Thus all tweets from the three main devices he allegedly used were collected to avoid bias by researcher selection, using Twitter metadata, as research has shown that Trump tweeted from his personal Android before the inauguration, with one staffer having access to his account, and moving to a mandated government iPhone after (Rosenberg & Haberman, 2018; Newman, 2017; Feinberg, 2017). It is, however, virtually impossible to know for certain. The dataset used is a combination of the archived tweets from the TrumpTwitterArchive, analysed in Atlas.ti. This archive is used rather than the metadata straight from Twitter as it includes tweets that have later been deleted. It was important in this study to include tweets that were deleted as it most closely reflects Trump’s use of Twitter.First the relevant tweets were imported into Atlas.ti with their corresponding dates and coded as “true” of “false” as to whether they were a retweet. Each tweet was imported as a case. Retweets were then removed from the study, leaving the total of 11,406 (Table 1). All 11,406 tweets were then read manually by the researcher. During this initial reading, common themes were noted, as well as expectations that had been met and those that were incorrect. In the second reading, key words and phrases were noted in relation to the research question.The tweets were then analysed quantitatively. First, tweets were analysed in Atlas.ti as to the most common words. All tweets were then coded with words related to immigration and Trump’s specific language on the topic, as noted in the initial readings. Each of these words was manually and then automatically analysed as to find the highest cooccurring word in relation to it, in order to observe trends. Significant words were then selected from the initial analysis for further exploration.Further tweets that warranted further analysis on an individual basis were noted in the first and second readings of the tweets.Quantitative analysis is useful for counting tweets and finding textual patterns — which words are used in concurrence with words such as ‘immigrant’ or ‘danger’, for example. This must also be reinforced by qualitative analysis of the discourse, to remove researcher bias in qualitative analysis and to avoid missing patterns that may be lost in quantitative analysis. For example, when coding a word such as “illegal”, it was necessary to manually read each code within this group so as to differentiate between tweets referring to illegal immigrants and discourse on Hillary Clinton or the Mueller investigation. By diving the tweets into code groups, it was easier to then separate tweets that were relevant to the research and those that weren’t.It is clear that the researcher will always have bias. The intention of manually reading all 11,406 tweets was to try and remove as much of this bias as possible — for the research to have, to the best of it’s ability, interpreted the data as a whole before moving into the specifics of discourse around immigration.3 Analysis/ResultsIn regard to creating an “expert language” within which subtext is understood from those familiar with Trump’s rhetoric, there were trends. It was found that he often capitalises words within a concept or idea that he wishes to emphasise: for example, “Rigged Witch Hunt” (@realDonaldTrump, August 14, 2018) or “Crooked Hillary” (@realDonaldTrump, Oct 16, 2017). He sometimes capitalises full words or sentences, giving the impression that he is shouting, or emphasising what he is saying — although it is less frequent than expected. A certain style is clearly apparent, and can easily divide tweets into categories, for example, a statement is usually ended with one word that rounds off the sentiment, for example; “sad” which is used 64 times at the end of a tweet, or “bad” which ends a tweet 44 times.It was expected that much of the discourse on Trump’s Twitter feed would be slanderous or critical of his opponents: there was a significant chunk of the tweets that were of this nature, but contrary to expectations the nature of the tweets were more positive than negative. For example, he congratulated others in 258 different tweets. When referring to opponents, his critics or people he simply does not seem to like, he will frequently use derogative language that dehumanised them: “Good work by General Kelly for firing that dog” (@realDonaldTrump, August 14th, 2018). He uses the phrase “Animal Assad” in three tweets (@realDonaldTrump, twice on the 8th April 2018, and once on the third of November 2017).The most frequent use of Twitter for Trump appears to be for gossip or interjection into public discourse. On initial reading it was found that he spent a large portion of time either endorsing or congratulating people, or injecting his own opinion into a public discussion, such as directly tweeting at American television show Fox and Friends; or criticising opponents, whether through personal snipes or prolonged, multi-tweet threads of what essentially appears as ranting. All of this discourse can be catalogued as reactionary tweeting: tweets that respond to perceived successes or failures of his peers and/or responses to news stories about himself. This is the bulk of the discourse on his feed, contrary to our expectations.There is a subtext to most of the discourse on immigration, which is that the rhetoric is in relation to people of colour. This is not explicitly said but through further research it seems to be inherent in the discourse. The majority of the time that Trump is discussing immigration he is either referring to immigrants from Mexico, or (explicitly) Syrians. Occasionally he lets the reader make this connection themselves, by using phrases like “certain people” (12 times in relation to immigration) with a wink and a nod that you know what he means. Trump has denounced implications of racism, for example by tweeting “I am the least racist person” (@realDonaldTrump, August 6th, 2019, 05:57) and yet, announcements of (unproven) statistics on African-American and minority unemployment levels still seemed to sit uneasily within the narrative.We theorised that those tweets referring to African-American and minority unemployment levels reveal a subtext within themselves. At no point does Trump refer to overall unemployment levels in the U.S. — he specifically references unemployment in minorities. Although it is not specifically stated, this can be interpreted as more of a coded discourse than initially apparent; rather than celebrating (again, unproven) lower levels of unemployment, it seems more likely to feed into racial stereotyping — mainly, the deeply offensive and racist misconception that people of colour are unemployed because they are avoiding work. And thus, through this discourse, he is not in actual fact misinforming his followers about false unemployment numbers, but reassuring his followers that he is making people work. This may seem like a bit of a reach — but in the context of other public actions in which he interacts with people of colour, he has repeatedly shown himself to be bigoted (buying the NFL players KFC when they came to the white house; publicly criticising Colin Kaepernick for taking the knee at basketball games to protest police violence; infamously failing to criticise nazi protestors after the death of a protestor in Charlottesville and later saying in a speech that there were “some very fine people on both sides” (Press Conference at Trump Tower on August 15th, 2017); or allegedly referring to countries with majority people of colour as “shithole countries” and implying that the US needed migrants from places such as Norway, a majority white country (Beckwith, 2018)).As expected, the overall tone of the discourse was informal. Trump rarely uses complicated language, although this might just be a reflection of the way he speaks, rather than a conscious choice to appeal to as wide an audience as possible.4.1 Immigration as a direct threatNoticeably references to immigration and anti-immigrant rhetoric were less frequent than expected. Through the initial analysis of keywords it was discovered that mentions of immigration specifically were relatively small. However, when these references were made, there was a clear pattern. Immigration was not tweeted about in a positive light in a single case. It was when looking at the highest cooccurring words (Table 4) that patterns became clearest. 66% of the instances in which “aliens” were mentioned it was in cooccurrence with the word “illegal” and “criminal”. The next most cooccurring words were “border” with a 41% rate, and “violent” with a 12% rate. In not a single tweet that included the word “aliens” was the discourse positive. This trend repeated with the word “immigrant”, with the highest cooccurring word “illegal” at a frequency of 86%, and border at 44%; and with “illegals”, a slang word used in reference to immigrants used 277 times by Trump in the analysis, the highest cooccurrence was with the word “border” with 71% and “Mexico” with 47%. These words and phrases create almost a loop in this analysis, where a mention of one of these key words inevitably led back to another. Rather than the conversation on immigration having a broad range, there is a specific narrative that arises. The narrative groups together most, if not all, immigrants with the label of “illegal” and “aliens”.Analysis of tweets containing the words “immigrant”, “aliens” and “illegals”, can thus all be used almost interchangeably with little difference in surrounding discourse. Immigration is consistently discussed as a large, impending crisis. “Pouring” was frequently used alongside “big flow”, “caravan”, “invaded”, “surge” and “large numbers”. This subtext of an imagined wave or ‘pouring in’ of people was supported by more explicit language, such as “South Carolina needs strength as illegals and Syrians pour in” (@realDonaldTrump, 20th February, 2016, 17:02), and “tens of thousands of illegals are being apprehended (captured)” (@realDonaldTrump, 3rd September, 2019, 22:13). The nature of the immigrants was also made clear — or at least, Trump’s opinion of them. Most noticeably, more than discourse on the economy or alleged “line-cutting” was the implication (or more frequently statement) that immigrants were dangerous: which supports our second hypothesis, Trump’s discourse on Twitter is expected to have positioned immigrants as a direct threat to American citizens. Frequently immigrants were described as “criminal”, “violent”, “dangerous”, “guilty”, “offenders” who were trading in “drugs” and “human trafficking”. Immigrants were accused of being “set free to prey on innocent Americans” (@realDonaldTrump, March 13th, 2018, 10:27); they were frequently accused of committing violent crimes without citation or evidence, for example in one tweet “five people killed in Washington State by a middle eastern immigrant” (@realDonaldTrump, September 25th, 2016, 07:18).It was further suggested that stronger border security (and by extension, less immigration) would “save american lives” (@realDonaldTrump, November 4th, 2016, 01:46), with frequent hyperbole that suggested a “National Emergency at the Southern Border” (@realDonaldTrump, March 17th, 2019, 03:58), or that “this is a public safety crisis” (@realDonaldTrump, April 17th, 2018, 04:34).4.2 Trump as America’s SaviourThere were 32 instances in which he explicitly says that he is the only person capable of solving key issues, two of which were directly related to immigration, “Our southern border is unsecure[sic]. I am the only one that can fix it” (@realDonaldTrump, July 3rd, 2015) and “Such a big problem for our country-I can solve” (@realDonaldTrump, August 26th, 2016); and one which explicitly conflates ISIS and border security, and by proxy, immigration, “5,000 ISIS fighters have infiltrated Europe.Also,many in U.S. I TOLD YOU SO! I alone can fix this problem!” (@realDonaldTrump, March 24th, 2016). An expected and clear narrative that Trump created was a criticism of the handling of immigration from the Obama administration; and the attitudes of Democrats who were allegedly “protecting MS-13 thugs” (@realDonaldTrump, May 26th, 2018). Frequently when he endorsed a fellow Republican it was in the context of their attitudes toward border security, and disparagements of Democrats was consistency in relation to their seemingly poor immigration policies. This leads us to the third hypothesis, Trump is expected to present himself as the only person capable of managing an alleged migrant crisis. Our research found that Trump presents himself as the only person capable of mentioning anything — not just immigration. When referring to himself he frequently uses words such as “best”, “only”, “win” or “winning” and “great”. One particularly insightful tweet reads “Nobody will protect our Nation like Donald J. Trump. Our military will be greatly strengthened and our borders will be strong. Illegals out!” (@realDonaldTrump, March 26th 2016).4.3 America Against the WorldMuch of the analysis tacitly infers results as to the first hypothesis, Trump is likely to create a discourse on the subject of immigration that pits Americans against immigrants in an ‘us’ vs. ‘them’ rhetoric. An ‘us’ vs. ‘them’ narrative is thus more implied than explicit, contrary to what we expected. This may come from the sense that Trump is consistently tweeting to his loyal fanbase and followers — the ‘us’ does not require creating as it is implicit within the narrative. The techniques and language used on Twitter creates the sense that Trump is conversing with his friends; letting you in on the truth, revealing what is ‘really’ happening.In conjunction with this implicit creation of the communal ‘us’ together with Trump, the idea of immigrants as outsiders is a given. Trump does not need to state that immigrants are not ‘like us’ — he knows who his audience is, and his platform from the beginning has been one of othering immigrants and even the ‘dreamers’ or children who were born in the U.S. to immigrant parents. This narrative is thus not as explicitly clear in the research. Although we could reach a conclusion on the narrative of ‘us’ vs. ‘them’, it would be hard to reach without researcher bias interfering with the results. Inferring from the language used does create some expectations, but these are left largely down to the individual’s interpretation.ConclusionsIt has been said that every great President has his war. And if there is no literal war, incumbent Presidents repeatedly have been found to find a new threat to combat in order to project an image of themselves and their administration as necessary in order to combat said threat. Examples include former President Bill Clinton’s “war on drugs” (which disproportionately incarcerated African-American men on petty drug charges), or former President George Bush and former Prime Minister of England Tony Blair’s “war on terror” (in which a desire to control Middle-Eastern oil supplies was hidden under the guise of a threat of nuclear weapons). We can also see examples of this at mid-term elections, dubbed the “October Surprise”, in which public or social ‘surprise’ crises are levied to garner support from opposing prospective or incumbent candidates. Examples of this include the Ebola crisis in 2014; the Clinton email scandal in 2016; the Osama bin Laden tape in 2004; and Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Each of these cases have even cited in Naomi Klein’s theory of “disaster capitalism” (2007). She posits that economic, climate or terrorist crises or threats are exploited by politicians in order to profit from the fear created by such events. This theory can be applied to examples of election scandals that capitalise on fear in the American voters in order to sway their votes directly before an election. Extensive research has been conducted into how crises affect voting patterns and Presidential support, such as Voting After the Bombings: A Natural Experiment on the Effect of Terrorist Attacks on Democratic Elections by Jose G.Montalvo, and Are Voters Sensitive to Terrorism? Direct Evidence from the Israeli Electorate by Claude Berrebi and Estban F Klor.The biggest question that arises from this research is why Trump has such a strong anti-immigrant narrative in his discourse. We draw upon Naomi Klein’s The Shock Doctrine and Isabell Lorey’s State of Insecurity to theorise that Trump creates a sense of insecurity and cultural vulnerability that he then exploits in order to be necessary to the American electorate. If he is the only one talking about a crisis, then by implication he is the only one willing to solve it. He then reinforces the narrative that he can solve this crisis explicitly, whilst positing the concept that he is the most capable. These two books address similar themes; the effects of collective trauma on governance, politics and power.Klein’s work first looks at the effects of shock treatment on the individual. She looks at research undertaken by the CIA in the 1950s that discovered a new form of torture in order to get the subject into a state where they would be malleable enough to submit to authority; shocking them into a state where they regressed into a childlike fear, in which they are more inclined to do what they are told and trust what they are told. She shows that these techniques don’t just work on individuals, but whole societies too. In the aftermath of terrorist attacks, climate or economic crises, civil wars or dictatorships, societies are left in a state of collective shock and uncertainty, making them vulnerable to collective manipulation; “countries are shocked — by wars, terror attacks, coup d’état and natural disasters. And then they are shocked again — by corporations and politicians who exploit the fear and disorientation of this first shock to push through economic shock therapy” (Klein, 2007, p.26–27). She tracks how Milton Friedman developed this technique and advised politicians around the world on how and when to take advantage of the state of shock that societies are left in after these crises, by pushing through reforms or austerity measures that citizens might otherwise have resisted.Isabell Lorey states “just as the discourse of ‘financial crisis’ can and does work to sore up the need for greater managerial control of the market […], so the discourse of ‘precarity’ consolidates power among those who wield the power to alternately promise its alleviation and threaten its continuation.” The paper theorises that Trump is creating his own war, and his own shock in which to leave Americans in a state of uncertainty, requiring a saviour who will offer them a magic cure — and that that is exactly what he does, through self-congratulatory rhetoric and populist nationalism that pits the American people against a common enemy — in this case, the traumatic assault of an influx of “criminal” immigrants.By Daisy Bata, originally written as a Master’s Thesis on the Political Science Master’s at the Universitat Autónoma de Barcelona in August 2019ReferencesKlein, Naomi.
