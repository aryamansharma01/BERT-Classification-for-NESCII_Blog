A robótica por elas,https://medium.com/stemparaminas/a-rob%C3%B3tica-por-elas-db83808bebdb?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Robotics,Women In Tech,STEM,Women in STEM,Competition","Ilustração por Evelyn CorreiaSe eu pudesse descrever a robótica em uma palavra, seria oportunidade, afinal trata-se do contato com a ciência e a tecnologia, além da aprendizagem de conceitos de Matemática, Física e Engenharia. Existem muitas modalidades de robótica, cada uma com sua especialidade e objetivo, porém o que todas têm em comum é incentivar cada vez mais os jovens a desenvolverem projetos e programarem robôs. Esses conhecimentos adquiridos não são somente para competição, pois nela desenvolvem habilidades para o resto da vida. A oportunidade que a robótica oferece vai além de robôs, se trata do futuro, do incentivo e do amor por STEM.A robótica incentiva jovens a seguirem carreira na ciência por encorajar o protagonismo feminino na ciência. Em uma pesquisa com meninas que participam de torneios de robótica promovidos pela FIRST Lego League, um programa internacional estadunidense sem fins lucrativos que desafia os estudantes a buscarem soluções para problemas da sociedade moderna e desenvolverem competências científicas, concluiu-se que mais de 80% das entrevistadas foram encorajadas a seguirem carreiras na ciência graças ao contato com a robótica e todas elas acreditam que a robótica pode incentivar o protagonismo feminino na ciência. Segundo a mesma pesquisa, até mesmo as que não pretendem seguir carreira na ciência foram impactadas e viram esses projetos como uma força feminina.Uma das entrevistadas relatou que participar de torneios a inseriu no mundo científico e despertou seu desejo de seguir astronomia, graças a temporada Into Orbit, que tratava sobre projetos espaciais. A robótica vem abrindo portas para ideias e incentivando o amor pela ciência, uma das meninas relatou: “Na minha equipe de robótica haviam 6 meninas e 1 menino, existia um enorme estímulo da prática de atividades científicas, fomos encorajadas e sempre apoiadas.”Porém, temos que destacar que há diferentes realidades como a presenciada por outra entrevistada: “Fui a primeira menina da minha escola a passar na seletiva, assim como a única menina da equipe que passou para o nacional, o que me traz um certo orgulho e uma tristeza por não ter mais mulheres na equipe podendo ter a mesma experiência que eu. Espero, profundamente, que nas próximas gerações, hajam meninas tão apaixonadas e encorajadas quanto eu.”Quando há incentivo, há mudanças e, felizmente, cada vez mais meninas sentem-se inspiradas a seguirem, sem medo, os sonhos científicos. Paulo Mol, o diretor de operações do SESI Nacional, a organização que promove os torneios de robótica no Brasil, disse em uma entrevista que o número de inscrições femininas nos torneios aumentaram significativamente nos últimos anos e a divulgação da robótica tem sido a principal responsável.Dos mais de cinco mil estudantes participantes do torneio de robótica SESI FIRST LEGO League, 43% são meninas. Esse dado aponta que com o passar do tempo as mulheres foram ganhando espaço nas áreas científicas. Ver programadoras, meninas, desenvolverem projetos incríveis ao lado de meninos, sem preconceito e sim com respeito, consideração, valorização e, principalmente, representatividade é um dos maiores ganhos que poderíamos ter.A jovem Ana Carolina Queiroz é um grande exemplo de inspiração, afinal, com 18 anos, ela participou do congresso Summit Girls na China, que reúne meninas ao redor do mundo para discutir sobre o empoderamento feminino e o engajamento econômico, e a estudante brasileira decidiu realizar um projeto de incentivo feminino no ramo da robótica. Outra iniciativa incrível é a página FIRST LEGO Girls. Em conversa com uma das fundadoras, Victória Vilela Nogaroto, ela disse: “O propósito da FIRST Lego Girls é empoderar a próxima geração de garotas na área da ciência e da tecnologia, queremos que mais garotas tenham a oportunidade de participar do mundo STEM, nós queremos ser ouvidas, queremos ser representadas e o mais importante, queremos ser transformadoras do hoje para tornar o amanhã um lugar melhor.”São projetos como esses que inspiram a participação de mais meninas na robótica. Há um longo caminho até alcançar a igualdade de gênero, entretanto, com pequenas ações podemos quebrar o estereótipo de que apenas garotos podem estar nesse meio.A robótica pode mudar vidas. Na mesma entrevista com a Victória, ela conta: “Foi na robótica que eu descobri meu amor pela área STEM, adorava como as peças se encaixavam, como se um mundo de possibilidades estivesse bem ali na minha frente e com tantos conceitos físicos e matemáticos não poderia ter escolhido outra graduação para fazer que não fosse engenharia mecatrônica.”Com isso conclui-se que a robótica vem dando espaço ao protagonismo feminino e à representatividade, mas ainda temos uma longa trajetória pela frente. Por fim, vale enfatizar que as garotas na robótica não adquirem somente a preparação para o mercado de trabalho e o contato com a ciência. Além disso, nos torneios é possível fazer amizades, desenvolver maturidade, aprender, compartilhar e conquistar o nosso espaço: o espaço das mulheres, a nossa liberdade e igualdade na robótica, na ciência e na vida.Por Bianca Gajardoni.Bianca é uma menina de 15 anos que mora em Birigui, uma cidade localizada no interior do estado de São Paulo. Pretende estudar Relações Internacionais ou História, atualmente está cursando o primeiro ano do ensino médio, participa de uma equipe de robótica, é programadora e com isso pode aprender diversos conceitos físicos e matemáticos, além de desenvolver projetos científicos e viu o STEM para as mina como uma oportunidade de escrever sobre a importância do incentivo ao protagonismo feminino na ciência.Bibliografia:MELLO, Marina.

"<strong class=""bt"">Industry 4.0- Now &amp; Future: A Bird’s Eye View</strong>",https://medium.com/@RAPIDD_Academy/industry-4-0-now-future-a-birds-eye-view-38cf0d67ab89?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Industry 4 0,Process Improvement,Process Automation,Artificial Intelligence,Robotics","We are not unfamiliar with the term Industry 4.0. Some define it as the 4th industrial revolution. Is it so? To get in-depth knowledge, RAPIDD Academy held a webinar on 13th July 2020. We invited Shri Anand Deshpande to give us a bird’s eye view of Industry 4.0 and share his real-life experiences with us.Our Keynote Speaker, Shri Anand DeshpandeAnand ji has 30+ years of experience as an operational excellence leader in manufacturing and financial services. He is a Six Sigma Certified Black Belt who has helped to reduce the cost of product manufacturing and improve the product quality at Toyota and Ford. Shri Deshpande has led multiple projects on process improvement using Lean Six Sigma techniques.We were honoured to have him with us. The audience, fresh graduates and postgraduates of engineering and other disciplines were greatly rewarded. Here’s a tour of the webinar.The Industrial Revolution: A Journey - Then & NowMan and machines are now inseparable from each other. This is the era of smart innovations and speedy improvements to the existing versions. It took centuries to build the foundation of the first industrial revolution. The journey of industrialisation until now is not less fascinating than science fiction novels and movies. Take a look at the following figure depicting the journey of industrialisation:Shri Deshpande took us to time travel spanning through centuries that gave us a different view of the world of machines. Here is the gist:Industry 1.0: Perhaps the most revolutionary stage of industrialisation, machines of the 1800s were powered by water and steam. Mankind was taking baby steps towards process automation. Some economic historians term it as the biggest transition since the time when men learned to domesticate animals.Industry 2.0: The second wave of innovations in machinery began after 1870. Automation in mass production and assembly lines went along with further advancement in machinery used in steam-run manufacturing industries.Industry 3.0: It took mankind an entire century to usher in the third industrial revolution. From 1970 onwards, computers, automated processes and robotics took the front seat in the next stage of advancement.Industry 4.0: “Industrie 4.0” is the German equivalent of the 4th industrial revolution. The world was introduced with it in 2011. Initially, it was adopted as a government policy to give Germany a competitive edge in the manufacturing industry. Now, Canada, Japan, Australia, Singapore, Austria and Switzerland are also leading the tempo.The most striking feature is the fast advancement of Cyber Physical Systems or CPS. This includes smart machines propelled by the Internet of Things or IoT, autonomous production facilities and hi-tech storage systems like the Cloud. The following state-of-the-art technologies are spearheading this transition:Artificial Intelligence or AIMachine Learning or MLBig DataAugmented Reality or ARVirtual Reality or VRCyber SecurityAnandji explained how these technologies are revolutionising industrial production. The following figure depicts the technologies which are impacting smart industries the most:Autonomous Robots: Robots used in manufacturing industries work in tandem with humans. For example, they are used to transport manufactured goods to warehouses and vice versa. Easy set-up, operation and control give them an edge over even the automated guided vehicles or AGVs. The cost to build autonomous robots will further reduce with continuous R&D.Simulation: Simulated models of people, things and processes offer a complete overview of intricate operational stages in industries. It is also known as digital twin technology. Simulation has a vast scope of benefits. For example, with simulated process-models, we can have a clear picture of how the successful Six Sigma projects can increase the bottom-line financial benefits of industries.The following figure depicts how simulation is transforming healthcare industry:image source: https://bit.ly/390iHwtHorizontal & Vertical System Integration: Production hierarchies of smart factories are inter-connected with IoT technology. Unlike traditional hierarchies, they interact horizontally and vertically.In the horizontal system, smart machines, equipment and production units network through the internet. The horizontal system integration ensures that machinery, devices and processes seamlessly operate together.In the vertical system, different shop floors and processes network via the internet. The vertical system integration ensures that horizontally interconnected units and systems like ERPs seamlessly communicate together.The Industrial Internet of Things: There are many reasons why consumers buy IoT devices. On many occasions, current fads may also influence buying decisions. However, the decision to implement the Industrial Internet of Things or IIoT is very different from that of consumer IoT.Recommenders of IIoT analyse business cases to assess the benefits. Management board members review such recommendations and make business-driven decisions.image source: https://bit.ly/2WmEZn7Cybersecurity: Industry 4.0 is about IIoT, the Cloud, autonomous robots and Big Data. All these devices and technologies deal with data storage and transfer. Naturally, cybersecurity is an integral aspect of Industry 4.0.image source: https://bit.ly/2Xo86XQCybersecurity guidelines address a wide audience. These guidelines include cybersecurity best practices, measures and recommendations. For example, IIoT vendors and IIoT device operators should consult the guidelines to verify the security setups of their Industry 4.0 solutions and services.The Cloud: Industry 4.0 and the Cloud is a winning combination of digitisation and operations of digitised manufacturing units. For example, industries can choose data storage or cybersecurity services, among others from Cloud service providers. They can scale services based on changing requirements. The latter greatly depends on market demand, cost control and ROI.image source: https://bit.ly/3ftCgzOAdditive Manufacturing: AM or Additive Manufacturing techniques are completely changing the traditional manufacturing ecosystem. One fine example is the CAD or computer-aided design method. Final products are fabricated from separate layers or parts obtained from CAD files. The latter improves complex product designs, keeps meticulous documentation files for the ease of communication, creates databases and enhances the productivity levels of designers.image source: https://bit.ly/2Wmp4FwAugmented Reality: Augmented Reality or AR is the technology that adds extra dimensions to the real world by overlaying texts, images, videos and sound clips. We get an enhanced experience of the real world with which we can also interact digitally. For example, operators can get a real-time view of production plants through AR-driven smart glasses.AR has a vast scope of application in the Industrial 4.0 environment. AR is used in manufacturing, logistics, support and maintenance, sales and presales and work safety.image source: https://bit.ly/3fvXWeMBig Data & Analytics: Data is the lifeblood of smart industries. Data is a business asset. Big data is nothing but an enormous amount of data. Analytics methods are used to optimise the use of Big Data for the sustainable development of smart industries. Big Data Analytics is extensively used in the R&D departments of industries.Technology is one of the building blocks of Industry 4.0. The rest of the blocks are process and organisation. Three of them are completely transforming traditional manufacturing relationships.Anand ji took us to a short tour of a day in his professional life that gave us a glimpse of how in real life the whole transformation is taking shape.Some Real-life ExamplesWe’ve already read about 9 technologies and how they are transforming traditional manufacturing relationships. Shri Deshpande shared survey-report statistics and interesting examples in this regard.Industrial Robots at Automotive OEM UnitsFord is using industrial robots at their auto assembly plants located in North-America and Europe. According to reports published by the Robotic Industries Association (RIA), 22,598 industrial robots were sold in 2012 only in North-America. The automotive industry is one of the biggest consumers of industrial robots. Since 2011, there has been a 47% rise in the sale of industrial robots at automotive original equipment manufacturing (OEM) units in North-America. Also, the sale has recorded a 16% rise at automotive component supply units.AI in Automotive PaintingIn 2019, Lamborghini had implemented AI in one of its newly opened automotive painting units in Northern Italy. The automobile giant has introduced Industry 4.0 technology to paint the bodies of its Urus Super SUV models.The aim is to meet the high-quality painting demands and the unit’s flexibility for products and the painting process. For example, AI painting enables the application of multi-layer paints on car bodies which has simplified the process of customisation.Virtual Hand Gestures to Record DataInspired by the gaming industry, BMW has applied the virtual hand gesture detection technique for quality testing of bumpers at its Landshut plant. Earlier, technicians would document data and feed them to PCs. Sometimes they had to go to different workstations to collect data. They also had to keep in memory the intricate details of faults detected during quality testing. This would cost valuable production time of technicians. Also, the chances of error were high.Now, BMW has installed the gesture detection system which has made quality testing more flawless and less time consuming. Specific gestures have specific meanings. For example, if technicians signal a wiping gesture across bumpers, it marks them as perfect. 3D cameras with sensors record these gestures. These data are stored into integrated databases and evaluated according to the checklists.The gesture detection system is so easy to understand and work with that BMW didn’t have to run separate training sessions for technicians. Also, technicians don’t need special devices like microphones or smart glasses to record data.Industries of all sizes can implement Industry 4.0 practices. There are parameters to assess Industry 4.0 readiness. Shri Deshpande gave us further insights on this.16 Dimensions of Assessment3 foundational pillars of Industry 4.0 are process, technology and organisation. To maximise the benefits of Industry 4.0, manufacturers should apply its best practices on all these 3 pillars. Smart Industry Readiness Index or SIRI and the rest of other accompanying matrices help such visionary manufacturers to assess their facilities against Industry 4.0 readiness.There are 8 sub-pillars which represent critical aspects of an industry which need immediate focus in the transformation journey. The mapping of the 3 pillars and 8 sub-pillars take place in 16 dimensions. These are 16 areas of assessment.Image Source: https://bit.ly/3epjPLdManufacturers can use tools to fragment each of the 16 dimensions to get a clear picture of the steps they should take to match Industry 4.0 standards.The Assessment Matrix: It’s a self-diagnostic tool for manufacturers that guide them to start, nurture, scale and sustain the Industry 4.0 transformation-process. The Assessment Matrix tool simplifies the assessment process by breaking down each SIRI dimension into 6 improving bands of maturity. For example, manufacturers can assess the technological maturity of their industries, compare the results with the scores earned by their competitors and detect the problems behind the gaps with the help of this tool.The Prioritisation Matrix: It’s a management planner tool for manufacturers to identify the high-priority SIRI dimensions which need the biggest transformation process to deliver most impacting and long-term results.The audience got a clear picture of Industry 4.0 from Shri Deshpande. He also shared with us some valuable tips to get the best results from A3 problem-solving method, developed by Toyota. Stay tuned with us to know more about how irrespective of industry sectors, A3 problem-solving and Lean Six Sigma methods can continuously improve operations and minimise wasteful practices.Written byRAPIDD AcademyFollow6 6 6 Industry 4 0Process ImprovementProcess AutomationArtificial IntelligenceRoboticsMore from RAPIDD AcademyFollowMore From MediumCivic Tech takes on a pandemicLorin Camargo in Code for AllWhy Did Sony partner with Microsoft in Cloud Gaming?Michael Tauberg in The StartupLithium-Air Batteries Could Give Electric Vehicles a 1,000 Mile RangeTim Ventura in PredictApple Agrees to Pay $25 Per iPhone Ensnared in ‘Batterygate’ SlowdownsPCMag in PC Magazine3 Reasons Firefox Quantum Is the Best Browser for AndroidGadget HacksWho’s Using Your Face?

Nusret36x: The big idea for Robotic Sous Chefs,https://medium.com/@eltonjtd/nusret36x-the-big-idea-for-robotic-sous-chefs-90db7721872f?source=tag_archive---------2-----------------------,"Robotics,Alexa,Food,Restaurant,IoT","Designing Robotic Sous Chef for restaurantsAn example of Cobots deployed as Robotic chefsFor several years through my high school and undergrad studies I have been developing Robots as part of my interest and fascination ranging from Battle bots, Martial Rover Prototypes, Bionics, Robot that moves like a squirrel and the very popular robotic manipulator arms. By being immersed in this sector I have come to realize that the 21st century is the age of Collaborative Robots or Cobots as we generally call it. We might not have seen them around us as much because most of them are being deployed inside large industries, or space projects or OT’s for tele surgeries but they surely are assisting us, humans, with our jobs.Now, what makes Cobots fascinating?… Well, the fact that they can talk, listen, understand, and work around humans in an extremely safe and comfortable manner. In this blog, I will take you through the evolution and use of Cobots as chefs, yes, robots that work in kitchens. I will also walk through a few characteristics that I think make Cobots very useful and probably even better than humans at performing physical tasks. By the way- the idea of kitchen robots is not new. The 1989’s Back To The Future 2 featured Master-Cook, a robot with a screen and two arms for helping to cook.Snapshot from the 1989 film ’ Back To The Future 2' showing the Cobot ‘Master-Cook’ in the backgroundSo how does a Cobot Sous Chef look like? If you imagine human arm like looking two machine hands that chop-chop-chop and saute-saute-saute; you are definitely right, but these are very high-fi and are designed for deluxe domestic home use, the best one I’ve seen is being developed by Moley Robotics. But this blog is intended to show you the kind of Robotic Chefs that can cook in large restaurants. They might not quite look exactly like two human hands but their functions are pretty much with the same distinction and agility, in fact, faster and can cover a larger workspace too.Some of these robots I have seen are generally capable of a 6 D.O.F (degree of freedom) movement and have abilities limited to making just salads, or sandwiches and setting up your ice cream, one such example is Alfred by Dexai with whom I personally had a chance to interact with. But on the other hand, these types of Robots are suitable for doing fast, complex, and bulk tasks in large-sized restaurant kitchens, and sensing this very potential I thought of a few characteristics in a Robotic Sous that can rock it in a restaurant kitchen.Let me introduce you to Nusret36x, named after the most celebrated chef Nusret Golce (a.k.a SaltBae). Nusret36x is a robotic sous chef, it is inchoate in its prototype development yet, but I would like to express my design views as follows.A snapshot from the early development of Nusret36xUseful Redundancy: Redundancy is generally avoided while designing robots, however, I feel that ‘useful’ redundancy features of Nusret36x make it capable of mimicking human chef like styles and methods of cooking. This feature also equips Nusret with the liberty to perform a task in several different ways; just like we humans do.Usable Waist: Generally, robots and in this case even Robotic Chefs are serial link manipulators, this makes them immobile and limits its working agility and reachability i.e. it can cater to many kitchen tables. Nusret is designed to have a base that enables the complete robot to stir about multiple places on the restaurant floor quickly and precisely. This base is a parallel manipulator, and technically Nusret deems to be a Hybrid Serial-Parallel robot. This waist is thought to mimic the waist of a human chef and hence by inherence, we can understand the level of agility Nusret can demonstrate.Minimum Singularities: Singularities in any robot are the areas of the workspace where the robot acts crazy or stuck. In simple language, a singularity is an area in the workspace where the robot cannot perform any task properly. Designing a minimum singularity Robot like Nusret36x is a tricky job, and it has a lot to do with the shape, sizing of the links and joints, and the configuration.In my final opinion, a successful Robotic Sous chef is the one that can cook faster than a usual human chef ;I mean that’s we invented robots right? while adding a personalized touch to its taste, just like a human chef.A pictorial depiction of integrating Alexa with Nusret36x to enhance cooking automation and dining experienceExploring possibilities with popular technologies like IoT and Voice technology to leverage the wonders Robotic Sous Chefs can pull, I am conceptualizing a restaurant situation where Alexa takes your orders and communicates with Nusret while it cooks for you. This also allows the customer to describe specifics in flavor, the quantity of ingredients, etc. Wouldn’t it be a classic experience? Let me know in the comments.Written byElton D'souzaInventor and Entrepreneur who is currently working on Devising Open innovation and Co-creation methods for brands | Visit me at eltondsouza.comFollow55 Some rights reserved55 55 RoboticsAlexaFoodRestaurantIoTMore from Elton D'souzaFollowInventor and Entrepreneur who is currently working on Devising Open innovation and Co-creation methods for brands | Visit me at eltondsouza.comMore From MediumIs There Such a Thing as a Dumb User?Akshayta Rao in The StartupPutting UX in Context with Contextual InquiriesJustin Morales in Thinking DesignTesla Cybertruck: When Design Goes ExtraterrestrialSohan Choudhury in BOOSTHow to complete a UX writing challenge during the interview processUX Writers Collective in UX Writers CollectiveSize MattersJeffrey Alan Henderson in GoodThin.gsFive great free online tools for designersMay NingBehind the Design: Xbox ControllerJoline Tang in Microsoft DesignThe Technology Behind Scratch and Sniff StickersDaniel Ganninger in Knowledge StewAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Perseverance: Search for Life Continues…,https://medium.com/@eraiitk/perseverance-search-for-life-continues-774571a27b14?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"Space,Robotics,Perseverance,Rover,NASA","At the beginning of our time, legends of flying men soared. And today, we have transformed those legends into a reality. The Prospect of alien life has daunted humanity since Darwin, but our evolution has been an impetus in our pursuit of greatness. New frontiers of discovery expand our understanding, from the tiny atom to the majesty of outer space. Mysteries long tolerated, are today, closer than ever to reveal their deepest secrets as human ingenuity continues to infringe earlier bounds. Here we stand, as Perseverance proceeds to join curiosity on the quest to find life.In this blog post, we take you on a journey around the perseverance rover. Arguably, the greatest robot of 2020.Mars Perseverance Rover, 3D Model - NASA's Mars Exploration ProgramEdit descriptionmars.nasa.govThe Body: Structural DetailsThe Perseverance rover’s body is a robust outer layer covering that carries and protects the rover’s on-board computer, electronics, and other hardware instruments.The rover’s body is called the Warm Electronics Box (WEB). The rover body thus protects the vital electronics of the rover and keeps the temperature in control. The warm electronics box is closed on the top by a piece called the Rover Equipment Deck, which facilitates the rover mast and cameras to take clear shots of the terrain in the Martian atmosphere as the rover travels.The rover is 3 meters long, 2.7 meters wide, and has a height of 2.2 meters. The weight of the rover is 1,025 kilograms. The chassis frame forms the bottom and sides of the rover; the Equipment deck its back; Belly pan is its bottom. Perseverance also has a coring drill to collect samples, which is different from previous rovers designed.Wheel Assembly :The Perseverance rover has six wheels, each with its own individual motor.The steering motors attached with the front two and rear two wheels enable the rover drive in 360 degrees. It uses the “Rocker-Bogie” suspension system having — — three main components:Differential: Connects to the left and right rockers and to the rover body by a pivot in the center of the rover’s top deck.Rocker: One each on the left and right side of the rover. Connects the front wheel to the differential and the bogie in the rear.Bogie: Connects the middle and rear wheels to the rocker.Legs of the rover are made of Titanium tubing with the same capabilities as of common mountain bike frames. These legs enable the rover to drive over knee-high rocks as tall as 40-centimeters.Wheels of the rover are made up of Aluminium, with curved Titanium spokes for springy support. Each wheel is 52.2 centimeters in diameter and can cover a distance of 1.65 meters in one full turn without slipping. The rover is designed to withstand a tilt of 45 degrees in any direction without tipping over. It consumes less than 200-watts. For comparison, your mobile phone charger outputs a power up to 60 watts!The Turret: Structure and SpecificationsThe 7-foot-long robotic arm on Perseverance is designed to have maximum flexibility with five Degrees of Freedom. The five degrees of freedom are the shoulder azimuth joint, shoulder elevation joint, elbow joint, wrist joint, and turret joint.“Turret” is the hand of the rover, present at the end of the robotic arm, carries scientific cameras, mineral, and chemical analyzers for studying the past habitability of Mars and choosing the most scientifically valuable sample cache.The various tools that will assist the rover in studying Martian terrain are SHERLOC and WATSON, PIXL, GDRT (Gaseous Dust Removal Tool), Ground Contact Sensor, and Drill.Now let us take a look at the instruments aboard the rover.SHERLOC- SpectrometerThe Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman Luminescence for Organics & Chemicals. Mounted on the rover’s robotic arm, SHERLOC uses spectrometers, a laser, and a camera to search for organics and minerals that have been altered by watery environments and may be signs of past microbial life. It is a noncontact instrument capable of operating at a distance of 5 cm from the target surface.RIMFAX- RadarFor subsurface observations, the Perseverance rover is using a modified Radar ranging instrument on its lower back end. The radar has a maximum range of 10 meters with a resolution of around 15cm. It is the first radar tool sent to the surface of MarsMOXIE — Mini TreeMoxie is one of the most important instruments aboard the Perseverance. Carbon dioxide makes up ~96% of the gas in Mars’ atmosphere. Oxygen is only 0.13%, compared to 21% in Earth’s atmosphere. MOXIE generates atmospheric oxygen using carbon dioxide, in order to facilitate future missions and possible human landings on Mars. although the current payload can only produce up to 10 grams oxygen per hour, it is a proof of concept for future large scale missions.MEDA- Environment analyzerMEDA — the Mars Environmental Dynamics Analyzer makes weather measurements including wind speed and direction, temperature, and humidity, and also measures the amount and size of dust particles in the Martian atmosphere. It consists of the following sensors:Air temperature sensorsRadiation and dust sensorsRelative humidity sensorThermal infrared sensorWind sensorsPressure sensorMastcam-ZFor Perseverance, the camera of choice is Mastcam Z, a stereo camera setup. Mastcam-Z has cameras that can zoom in, focus, and take 3D pictures and video at high speed to allow detailed examination of distant objects.Sample Handling:The Perseverance rover will gather samples from Martian rocks and soil using its drill and store them in sample tubes on the Martian surface. This entire process is called “Sample Caching.” Mars 2020 Perseverance rover is the first of its kind to have such sample collection and storing capability. The three significant steps in sample handling are:Step1: Collecting SamplesThe belly of the rover contains a rotating drill carousel, a wheel containing different kinds of drill bits. When the sample collecting site is finalized, the rover’s robotic arm reaches out to drill out the sample. Then a small robotic arm inside the rover belly picks up new sample tubes to the drill and transfer filled sample tubes into space where they are sealed and stored.Step2: Storing OnboardAfter the sample is collected in the tube, it is moved to inspection and sealing stations. Once the container is hermetically sealed, nothing can enter or leave it. The tubes are stored in the rover belly until the team decides on the time and place to drop the samples off on the surface.Step3: Depositing Samples on the SurfaceThe team will choose the time and place to drop off the sample tubes collected on the surface. The spot on the surface of Mars, where the samples will be dropped, will be known as “sample cache depot.” The depot location will be well-documented by both local landmarks, and precise coordinates form orbital measurements. The samples will be collected by future missions to potentially return to Earth.Written byERA-IITKFollow98 98 98 SpaceRoboticsPerseveranceRoverNASAMore from ERA-IITKFollowMore From MediumGeneral Relativity and The Black Hole Information ParadoxAlec FurrierWhy Astronomers Are Not a Huge Fan of Elon MuskAreeba Merriam in The StartupAsk Ethan: Do Neutrinos Always Travel At Nearly The Speed Of Light?Ethan Siegel in Starts With A Bang!Memories of Space: Before and After the ChallengerSeth BloomGas Giants Bounce Around — and Collide — in Alien Solar SystemsJames Maynard in The Cosmic CompanionThe Magic of a Shuttle LaunchThom Booth in SciSciEtyFrom Mezzotint to the MultiverseI Love Typography in The StartupThe Black Hole’s Wall of FireElla Alderson in PredictAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
"<strong class=""bt"">Integration of PEGA PDC with ServiceNow</strong>",https://medium.com/@mahiprashanth866/integration-of-pega-pdc-with-servicenow-1e41e0e4ff86?source=tag_archive---------4-----------------------,"Pega Training,Pegasystems,Education,Technology,Robotics","The integration of PEGA (Predictive Diagnostic Cloud™) PDC with ServiceNow is useful to track and manage the resolution of problems identified by the PDC in the systems. After configuring this unification, we can build ServiceNow incidents and events by splitting PDC cases. And also we can send several PDC notifications directly to ServiceNow.Configuring integration with ServiceNowThe configuration of this service requires the below things to perform;First, we need to Log in to PDC as a Manager.In the PDC header, click on the Properties button, and select Integrations > Integrations.Next, open the ServiceNow account’s URLNow, enter the user name and password here.Later, within the Target Table section, select the items need to create in Service Now by sharing a case: an Event.Finally, click the Submit button.If you are interested to Learn Pega You can enroll for free live demo Pega Online TrainingEnabling notifications to ServiceNowPDC automatically develops ServiceNow events/incidents by sending the selected event-based notification to ServiceNow directly. Now, we will look into how to maintain notifications in PEGA PDC.It needs to inform PEGA PDC users regarding system health and several events by setting up daily abstracts and event-based notifications. Moreover, we need to keep all or specific users updated with a complete refinement plan. It includes a list of up to the five most necessary items from different affected areas, a periodic abstract of new cases, and incident notifications.Adding a new notificationHere, we try to create a notification subscription.— Go to PDC header > now click the Properties button > do select Notifications> Manage notifications.Within the Manage notifications page click on New notification.Selecting types of notificationChoose between daily synopsis and incident-based notifications.To get a notification while a specific incident appears on the system; click on — Event-based notifications.Within the System field, select a monitored system.Now, go to Notification name field > you need to select the notification for that you want to create a subscription.To get a complete Refinement Plan from time to time, you may need the five most urgent items or an abstract of the latest cases > click Daily digest notifications.Go to the System field > select a monitored system.Next within the Notification name field, select the notification required to create a subscription.Later, within the Schedule section > select the specific days to send the notifications frequently.Optional: Setting the frequency of event-based notificationsAs a default, the PDC sends an event-based or incident-based notification in case an event occurs at least once in five mins. The users have the option to limit the number of notifications. Such as, if you expect that a particular problem might appear hundreds of times within a short time, and you want to shun producing un-important network traffic.Now go to the Notify when section > click on Event appeared at least <number> time(s) in the previous <time period>.In the text field, enter the least number of incidents, and in the drop-down list, select the period. Let’s enter 5 and 15 mins respectively to only get a notification in case the event occurs at least 5 times in 15 mins; for example.Learn for more Pega TrainingAdding recipientsDefine the recipients of the latest notification.Under the Notification method section, select the names you want to send notifications:To send notifications to a particular email address, go through the below steps:Select > Email checkbox from the menuTo add each recipient, click on> Add new, and then enter the recipient’s Email address in the specific field.Optional method: To send the hand-picked daily abstract to the selected recipients immediately, click on > Send now.To send event-based notifications to particular phone numbers choose the below steps:Select > SMS check box from menu.To add each recipient you want to, click > Add new, and later, in the Country prefix field and the Mobile number field, fill the recipient’s details.To create a ServiceNow event for every phenomenon of the selected event-based notification, use the below steps:Go to the ServiceNow checkbox > Select it.Under the Target table list > select the type of item that you want to build within ServiceNow.Muting notificationsYou can mute notification for the time being. Suppose; you are working on resolving a known issue and want to keep away unnecessary network traffic.Follow the below steps;PDC header > Properties icon > Select Notifications > there select -Manage notifications.Now, to mute notifications > click on the Click to Mute button.Unmuting notificationsActivate a notification that has been muted earlier.Again, go to > PDC header > click on Properties button > then select Notifications > click- Manage notifications button.To unmute/resume a notification > click on the Unmute button, next to the notification.Removing integration with a project management tool from PEGA PDCWe have an option to remove an integration that we no longer need under PEGA PDC.Again, Log in as a manager into PDC.Go to PDC header & click on the Properties button — and select the Integrations -> Integrations.Within the Configured Integrations section -> click the Delete button to remove the integration.Thus, other than ServiceNow, many other project management tools use PEGA PDC to track issues.Tools to monitor PEGA PDC system resourcesThere are several tools available to monitor system resources within PEGA PDC. Within system resources, we can find statistics and complete information regarding the usage and condition of our database, Elasticsearch, job schedulers, agents, listeners, the system’s resources, etc.Under the > System Resources > section the following landing pages comes in:DatabaseNodesResource UtilizationElasticsearchJob SchedulerAgentsListenersAgent queuesQueue ProcessorLet us discuss a few of them in detail.DatabaseIt is useful to check the use, statistics, and complete information regarding the status of the databases.Moreover, the following types of information found on the Database landing page;MetricsTablesQuery StatsNodesThese are useful to check the usage stats and all the information about the status of our nodes. We get the following information on the Nodes landing page:The total number of nodes within the systemThe number of nodes in the below conditions:RunningOfflineUnknownFor each node within our system, we can check the below details;Node health indicatorsNode infoBuild infoJVM infoJVM argumentsConfiguration setting infoAgentsThis is useful to check the usage, stats, and whole information about the status of our agents.We find the following information on the Agents landing page:Total number of agents within our systemThe number of agents in the following conditions:RunningStoppedExceptionMoreover, for each agent in the system, we can verify the below details:Node details, other agent details, and Historical agent data.ElasticsearchThis is useful to check the statistics, complete info & usage about the status of Elasticsearch.The following type of information is found on its landing page:Summary of MetricsDefault indexes detailsAnd the Search index host node detailsSimilarly, Job Scheduler, Listeners, Agent queues, Queue Processor & Resource Utilization are useful to check the usage, stats & all the details on their status.ConclusionThus, we reach to conclusion in this article.

Are we in the era of medicine revolution?,https://medium.com/@ansabali555/are-we-in-the-era-of-medicine-revolution-9ae9efddb6fb?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"Artificial Intelligence,Robotics,Machine Learning,Medicine,Medical Diagnosis","A patient with a footsore got admitted to the hospital and stayed there for 22 days, in a day or 2 she got mild phenomena doctors started the treatment after 4 days she was found to have un even heart rhythm (tachycardia) the heart starts beating faster. After a day she has trouble in breathing then had septic shock it was a clear indication of sepsis ( response to vital organ infection) she was admitted to ICU there her kidneys failed and on 22nd day she died. The sepsis is really hard to diagnose and it’s really confusing the deaths due to sepsis is more the breast cancer+ prostate cancer. The fault why she and most of the patients die is because the diagnoses are very difficult and the most of treatment cannot be executed prior to symptoms. Harvard study showed that 93 leading doctors were given cases of sepsis to diagnose all of them was confused while diagnosing.Two get rid of this problem many scientists are working hard to make a technique to make the diagnoses; some of them is find the way out by implementing machine learning. Targeted real time early warning system (TREWS) is the system designed by AI experts to unlock the doors to evolution of medicine, as the robot works on the AI and we human teach them via language (code) and also robot learn on their on by interacting with environment. Like the example of robot TREWS work on the same strategy it collects the data of hundreds and thousands of patients died due to sepsis and take the current data of patient on which it is doing the diagnoses and drive the result on the bases of this report doctors are saving lives of many patients. When TREWS given the task of miss manie who died of sepsis it diagnose her sepsis 12 hours earlier then doctors and best time of TREWS is 24 hours which means this system provide doctors to have large window to treat patient and save lives.This is the future of medicine system like TREWS gets batter which more data it works on big data it can be implemented batter when the data around the world is saved electronically and shared for free with this system. This is not only restricted sepsis but also the other deadly disease like HIV and cancer and be diagnosed prior to symptom and can be treated in time.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj2YSLPn6OYWritten byAnsabaliFollowArtificial IntelligenceRoboticsMachine LearningMedicineMedical DiagnosisMore from AnsabaliFollowAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

Trying to control these invasive fish species is incredibly challenging because native fish species and the wildlife that depends on them have very few options for survival.Researchers believe that robotic fish could be an invaluable tool in this fight¹. They think that these robotic predator fish will be especially effective against the world’s most destructive invasive species — the mosquitofish.Here Are 7 Inventors That Died From Their Own CreationsThey believed that progress was worth the riskmedium.comNative fish and also amphibians have been decimated by expansive mosquitofish populations within freshwater rivers and lakes throughout the world. Since traps and toxicants are the only tools available, past attempts to control these invasive fish have either failed or harmed local wildlife.Researchers discovered that these robotic predators induced fear and stress-related changes into the mosquitofish. A replica of the largemouth bass was used because it is the primary predator of mosquitofish. They believe that these stress-related responses will translate into lower reproduction rates.Autonomous Weeding RobotFarmWise, which is San Francisco-based startup, has developed an autonomous weeding robot for farmers². These marvelous robots allow farmers to significantly reduce their dependence on chemical weed killers.6 Remarkable Ways that Artificial Intelligence Has Fascinated the WorldThink of the things that AI will create in the futuremedium.comFarmers face increasing pressure these days from consumers to use fewer chemicals. Using fewer chemicals will also help maintain and preserve the integrity and quality of their soil. Additionally, weeds are also becoming most resistant to herbicides, which has made weed management much more challenging.This weeding robot utilizes a perception system that is driven by deep learning to analyze and capture real-time plant images. It then employs the latest embedded computers available.After these images have been processed, the unit knows exactly where the weeds are located, and mechanically remove them without using any herbicide.Robotic ChemistArtificial intelligence has been quite active in the drug industry. It has been used to rapidly increase the constant search for new drugs. Not only this, but it could also discover a new material that could significantly improve current technologies. While the majority of this work is being done either through simulation or by sifting through databases, there is still a lot of lab work required.5 Weaknesses of the Internet That Could Create a Hostile Global WarFuture wars will likely take place in Cyberspacemedium.comEnter the robotic chemist³. This new edition is proving to be a real asset to automation in the laboratory.

And it is even capable of making time-sensitive decisions regarding which experiments need to be conducted next according to previous results.Tiny Pollinating RobotsBelieve it or not, we are on the verge of having an insect apocalypse⁴. This is the combined result of global warming, pesticide use, and habitat loss. While this news may delight those of us who think bugs are creepy, it is actually a disaster for the world’s food supply. Approximately one-third of the world’s crops depend on the pollination process performed by various insects.These Are 7 Ways the Internet Is Becoming More HostileWhile we all love the Internet, it can bite the hell out of us.

Its wings beat 17 times per second, and it can hover and easily change directions and can travel at 15 miles per hour. It was created by Delft University of Technology, located in the Netherlands. And the creators are hopeful that one day this tiny flying robot will pollinate plants to feel this increasing demand.Researchers envision this little robot buzzing around agricultural warehouses and greenhouses, as they are small and light — posing no risk at all to humans that would work alongside them. While they would help maintain food production if insects keep disappearing, there are other potential applications for them as well.[1]: Sam Francis. (January 7, 2019).

"<strong class=""bt"">Better Than Human: Contextualized Automated Vehicle Intelligent Control</strong>",https://medium.com/@rwilliams09876/better-than-human-contextualized-automated-vehicle-intelligent-control-b23583178b3b?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Artificial Intelligence,Self Driving Cars,Robotics,Deep Learning,Machine Learning","AbstractThe following is a brief description of an artificial intelligence control design pattern that can potentially contribute to the development of robustly safe high-performance autonomous automobiles in the near-term. A functional element, referred to herein as a Deep Context Network (DCN), is presented as a fundamental technology in the proposed design pattern. A recurrent neural network architecture is considered for mapping vehicle context events to driver actions.IntroductionBased on reported outcomes and published works [1–5], a high level characterization of the current common automated vehicle (AV) control approach is illustrated in Figure 1, where Perception components provide input to Decision components which provide inputs to Control components.Figure 1. Functional Flow of Automated Vehicle Intelligent ControlIn such AV control framework defined in Figure 1, novel observations (i.e. unknown perception events) are incompatible with predictable control outcomes. However, verifiably safe operations require that control outcomes be predictable, at least in theory. As a result, engineers and scientists have heavily invested resources in the advancement of perception technologies, techniques, and supportive databases. Nevertheless, it is impossible to anticipate all future perception events that may occur on roadways and streets in the general public domain. Therefore, such control flow as defined by Figure 1 is inherently brittle, particularly concerning the sprawling, highly populated cities where the demand for personal transportation is high.A more robust design pattern is required. Such is presented in Figure 2, where Context has replaced the Perception component of Figure 1.Figure 2. Proposed Robust Functional Flow for Automated Vehicle Intelligent ControlIn such proposed robust design pattern, Context is informed by Perception components (Figure 3), but abstracts it away from the AI control flow, eliminating the introduction of brittle (i.e. unpredictable) behavior. Moreover, Context components can provide persistent information on a closed, well-understood domain that is defined by engineers during control system development to essentially score vehicle situational and performance qualities including, situational awareness, operational expectations, vehicle readiness, safety prioritization and margin, and other qualities.Figure 3. Context Represented as a Higher Abstraction Relationship to PerceptionThis article introduces an AV control flow that incorporates such contextualized information flow, referred to herein as Contextualized Automated Vehicle Intelligent Controller (CAVIC) (Figure 4). In the CAVIC concept, Context is generated by a Driving Context State Estimator and mapped to driving control decisions by a recurrent neural network.Figure 4. Contextualized Automated Vehicle Intelligent ControllerThe remainder of this article presents the components of the CAVIC concept and brief remarks of how the incorporated neural networks are trained. Also, included are remarks on how CAVIC integrates with current AV technology.Deep Context NetworkNeural networks (NN) can be utilized to learn and establish a deeply layered and complex tapestry of context from observed information patterns. In Figure 5 a deep context network (DCN) derived from image streams is illustrated. Here each layer of labels and associated data feed into processors that produce higher level labels and data. The labels are Contexts inferred from the producing processor’s inputs and the data is the result of computations that transform and enrich the information flow used by subsequent processors. As processing moves forward in the network, the developed Contexts become less granular and more nuanced.In general, each processor can be a NN, a traditional computer code program (i.e. C/C++ code), or combinations of such functionalities. The labels are qualitative abstractions that tend toward human interpretation and can generally be associated with an ordinal or Boolean behavior that defines relative membership or intensity. The developed data associated with the labels is generally quantitative and is generated to provide the sufficient input to higher layer processors for the production of useful higher level context (labels). Such quantitative information can include direct measurements. In Figure 5, nodes A and B are other processors, computer programs, static sources, or measurements.Figure 5. Deep Context NetworkDriving Context State GenerationFigure 6 provides an example high-level template for establishing continuous Driving Context States (DCS) related to the safe performance of an autonomous automobile. The illustrated network, a DCN comprised of smaller domain specific DCNs, is referred to herein as a Driving Context State Estimator (DCSE).Figure 6. Example Connectivity of a Safety Context State Generator in a Self-Driving CarThe Perception blocks are inputs to the DCSE, providing direct information to select domain specific DCNs. Domain specific DCNs are functionally referred to as Driving Context State (DCS) blocks. Each of the DCS blocks produces two classes of outputs. One class of output is input to DCS blocks that occur later in the context flow. The second class of DCS block output is a Context state vector provided, at time k, to a recurrent neural that generates automobile driving control actions for time k+1.In many cases, a first principal basis for the mapping of inputs to outputs may be known for the DCS processors and designers may utilize C++ (or other) code blocks to represent the DCS processors. Generally, driving data may be generated by simulated, robotic (i.e. State of the Art AV), and human expert drivers performing on progressive envelops of driving challenges. The driving datasets should be analyzed by the software engineering team to determine appropriate outputs of the DCS blocks. The Context outputs of DCS blocks can be considered analogous to human emotions, intuition, and judgement related to safety, damage mitigation, and other performance priorities. Therefore, the software development team may need to form a consensus concerning DCS block expected outputs and practice configuration control concerning the evolution of such design decisions. It should be noted that the experience of loss of perception data, or of poorly understood or sparse perception data, can be represented in the context states. After training, the DCS block outputs can be considered a generalization of what the designers consider the appropriate feeling (that a car should have) at each time record of the driving experience.Driver Action State GenerationFigure 7 illustrates the information flow for the generation of Driving Action States (DAS). Such states are coded information that map to human driver actions. Such driver actions are not sequences, but are discrete combinations of inputs that are defined on the scope of inputs available to command the control systems (i.e. the downstream parts that use differential equations to govern mechanical actuators) of an autonomous automobile. In the figure, driver actions are processed via a NN structure, or other Processor, to generate the coded DAS that will be used by the CAVIC. In cases where the Processor is a NN, then the Processor may be generated from NN supervised learning.For NN learning, as with the development of the DCS blocks, driver actions that generate the Action Codes datasets can be performed by simulated, robotic, and human expert drivers performing on progressive envelops of driving challenge. Ideally, the trained CAVIC will perform with response patterns and tendencies that are indicative of the drivers that generate the training datasets.Figure 7. Illustration of Driver Actions Used to Generate Coded Driver Action StatesContextualized Automated Vehicle Intelligent ControlThe training of the DCSE (as required) occurs prior to the training of the CAVIC’s RNN, which we will refer to herein as the Driving Action State Estimator (DASE). A general example of a potentially useful RNN architecture for the DASE is suggested in Figure 8, where the input vectors, so-called action-context vectors, are compositions of DCS and DAS outputs (Figure 9). Training datasets are developed progressively by simulated, robotic, and human expert drivers executing maneuvers on a performance envelope which should include passive and aggressive driving maneuvers. DASE training datasets should comprise DCS and DAS outputs at time k and DAS outputs at time k+1.Figure 8. Driving Action State Estimator Training Context Based Self-Driving AutomobileFigure 9. Functional Depiction of an Action-Context VectorIntegrations with the Current State of the ArtThe current state of the art AV technology can integrate with the CAVIC approach through the generation of the baseline driving datasets for the initial training of the CAVIC components. Such integration is ideal, providing practical baseline driving performance datasets on credible and practical performance driving envelopes and potentially leveraging datasets derived from repositories of recorded experiences and simulations.ConclusionsA novel intelligent control system design pattern for autonomous vehicles is introduced and presented as a potential path forward for achieving safe and nuanced autonomous driving performance in the general public domain.The introduced intelligent control design pattern, termed herein Contextualized Automated Vehicle Intelligent Controller (CAVIC), abstracts vehicle perception outputs into a network of layered dynamical Context states. Such Context states are designed and cultivated by engineers, during CAVIC development, to correspond to human interpretable nuanced dynamical response patterns to vehicle and environmental circumstances, priorities, and constraints.The aggregate of such Context states generated at time k are mapped to driver control actions at time k+1 by a recurrent neural network. Driver control actions can be learned directly from human expert drivers performing maneuvers, where such maneuvers can range from highly conservative to highly aggressive.CAVIC development is likely to be challenging and require substantial inventive engineering. However, its proposed translation of Context states to action states has roots in natural language processing, which may provide some comfort concerning its feasibility. Also, the payoff for incremental successes are large, portending autonomous vehicle intelligent control systems that can correlate complex environmental experiences with nuanced human safety priorities, and through learned generalizations by neural networks outperform even the best of their human teachers.References1.

L’humanoïde fait référence à la saga japonaise éponyme des années 80, et plus particulièrement au robot habité fictif RX-78–2. Ce Gundam est construit à taille réelle, soit 18 mètres de hauteur, depuis plusieurs mois dans la ville portuaire de Yokohama au sud de Tokyo.En juillet, les roboticiens en charge du projet ont publié une vidéo de tests de mouvements : le robot peut bouger ses membres, et se pencher. Il devrait également pouvoir se déplacer librement sur 24 degrés et ses “mains”, grandes de 2 mètres, ont des doigts totalement articulés. Pour la conception, les équipes étaient soumises à des restrictions de poids afin de ne pas construire une machine trop lourde et encombrante. Sans ce choix de machinerie et de matériaux plus légers, on estime que ce Gundam aurait pesé 3 fois plus lourd que ses 25 tonnes actuelles.Le robot aurait dû être présenté cet été, mais la pandémie mondiale a retardé l’événement au 1er octobre. Le Gundam de Yokohama surplombera le port pendant une année entière, et fera l’objet d’une exposition où les visiteurs en apprendront davantage sur la conception, la structure et le mécanisme de la machine. Les développeurs et fans de robots pourront également participer au développement du système à travers une plateforme dédiée et en open source et ainsi imaginer de multiples fonctionnalités.Actuellement, d’autres Gundam sont installés sur l’archipel mais ce ne sont que des statues. La ville de Shanghai a passé commande à son tour, sans préciser si elle souhaitait le modèle robotisé ou non.Découvrez notre fonds d’investissement spécialisé dans le secteur de la robotique : TRECENTO ROBOTIQUE ISR.Les performances passées ne préjugent pas des performances futures.

AirLab to present oral paper for Visual Interestingness at ECCV 2020,https://medium.com/airlabcmu/air-lab-to-present-oral-paper-for-visual-interestingness-at-eccv-2020-35bef2d5283b?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"Eccv 2020,Robotics,Carnegie Mellon,Air Lab,Darpa Challenge","The AirLab has one oral paper accepted by ECCV 2020 which will be held on 23–28 August this year. ECCV is one of the top conferences in computer vision and only has 2% acceptance rate for oral papers.The problem of visual interestingness detection is crucial for many practical applications such as search and rescue. Although prior research is able to detect significant objects or scenes, it is not able to adapt in real-time and loses interest over time after repeatedly observing the same objects or exploring the same scenes.This figure shows several examples of both uninteresting and interesting scenes in the SubTF dataset taken by the Team Explorer who won first place in the DARPA SubT Challenge tunnel circuit. The height of the green strip located at the right of each image indicates the interestingness level predicted by our unsupervised online learning algorithm when it sees the scene for the first time.To enable such behaviors for robots, the researchers argue that a learning system should have both a life-time human-like experience learned from a large amount of unlabeled data and a short-term learning capability for limited negative labeled data. This is because robots normally only know uninteresting objects before a mission and have to change their interests during a mission.The visual interestingness with different writing rates for drone video footage. As indicated by the arrows, a larger writing rate results in a faster loss of interest for new objects during online learning.To this end, they introduce an unsupervised learning model with a memory mechanism, which is able to train in real-time without back-propagation, resulting in much faster learning speed.The interestingness map detected for a mine tunnel (red marked).The experiments show that, although implemented on a single machine, the approach is still able to learn online and find meaningful objects for a practical search task in mine tunnels.Detected interesting scenesThis work is developed by the AirLab members including Chen Wang, Wenshan Wang, Yuheng Qiu, Yafei Hu, and Sebastian Scherer. It was sponsored by the ONR grant #N0014-19-1-2266 and use data from the DARPA Subterranean Challenge.AirLabCMUThe AirLab at Carnegie Mellon University (RI, CMU)FollowEccv 2020RoboticsCarnegie MellonAir LabDarpa Challenge1 clap1 clapWritten byChen WangFollowFollowAirLabCMUFollowThe AirLab at Carnegie Mellon University (RI, CMU)FollowWritten byChen WangFollowAirLabCMUFollowThe AirLab at Carnegie Mellon University (RI, CMU)More From MediumWhy Workers Need a ‘Digital New Deal’ to Protect Against AIThe Financial Times in Financial TimesYour Minimum Viable AlgorithmErik van der Pluijm in WRKSHPProgress in Artificial Intelligence Requires DiversityJennifer Harrison in Education ReportThe Birth of Wetwarealissa.greenberg in NEO.LIFEBuild a chatbot with Rasa stack — The Beginners GuideSoumya MukherjeeXAI: Explainable A.I. by Justification and IntrospectionGulfaraz Rahman in Just A.I.Human-Centered AI For Better Health OutcomesDavid Yakobovitch in Towards AIA.I.

You thought coding is only for geeks! Not anymore!,https://medium.com/turing-ninjas/you-thought-coding-is-only-for-geeks-not-anymore-f2ff6f29877e?source=tag_archive---------4-----------------------,"Digital Age,Artificial Intelligence,Robotics,Automation,Coding","Ever felt that your child can be the best at two things and not just one? Maybe he/she is interested in computer programming but you feel it is a very narrow and packed industry. Or maybe it’s the other way around and learning Programming is the safest route there is and they’re just mistaking an interest in drawings to be a passion in architecture. Either way, let us put your mind to rest and show you ways in which one can blend their training in computer coding to excel in other entirely non-technical fields.Automotive IndustryAutomotive engineering and programming have learnt to progress hand-in-hand owing to the trend of smarter cars turning into a standard. The blinking red “Check Engine” light is now considered ages old. Every newly designed car needs a touch-screen and voice activated interface. AI has also been introduced as more of a travel companion than the tool in cars like MG Hector with their #ItsAHumanThing.As such, Programming and Cloud Integration with regards to automobiles have been pushed into the spotlight these past years and we now find tons of opportunities and more interest to seek admission into the Automotive field with a background in coding.Medicine and PharmaceuticalsMedicine is an enormous field. It has very many subfields under it. Most relevant of these to our article are surgery, pathology, and genetic engineering.In the subfield of Surgery, technology plays a key role because precision is the name of the game. Human hands, unfortunately, are flawed sometimes and that leads to problems where delicate surgery has to be done. Enter Robotic Surgery, a way for us to go beyond human limitations. It is a very promising area for any programmer and has quite the competition as well.Pathology is the field of medicine focused on understanding the reasons behind the problem rather than the solution. AI driven pathology is the path to the future with the forever-updating database and a lot of space to grow.Genetic Engineering doesn’t directly deal with patients. It is the overarching field that helps make super-babies. Well, not just yet but it does help in making chemicals like Insulin for those who cannot produce it on their own. Programming systems that can read, simulate and possibly create new genetics are the biggest trend in the field currently.The Pharmaceutical field is rich in diversity and volume. Everyday, thousands of innovations are being made with the mixing of different chemicals and substances to create miracle drugs. Most of this work is being done by software. This is because, as we mentioned before, it is much faster and more efficient at simulating and coming up with viable solutions to problems.ArchitectureArchitects design modern marvels through their structures. But there’s only so much you can design on a Rolled Bond Paper. Thinking in 3D is imperative but being able to present the ideas in 3D is also important.This is where your expertise with programming comes in. You can channel the abstract thoughts into a CAD/CADD(Computer-Aided Design and Drafting) using applications like AutoCAD or QCAD and come up with innovative designs that weren’t possible before.Even things like scheduling the project can be automated with your knowledge leaving you space for creative thinking. One of the best parts about an architect having programming experience is that you can leave the most tedious thing to the software- Calculations! No need to break your flow getting stuck on one corner of the design.So get those old Blueprints out and finish them and if you erect a building be sure to give us credit.EducationDid you know that the first “Smart” class was made in 1995? It was a class with just a podium, a clicker, and surround speakers — considered to be “Smart” technology back then.Research into a computer-integrated whiteboard and technological aids resurfaced and boomed back in 2004 again by a company named EDUCOM. From then on, numerous organisations have come up which are trying to bring their own methods and resources to the field. Whether it’s creating educational games, platforms for online learning, Course Management Systems, Online learning tools or algorithms that are used for adaptive learning lessons, it seems as though there are no bad ideas for this field.If you ever felt that you had a great idea for a teaching-based program, now is one of the best times to realise that dream and help thousands of students while you’re at it.FashionEver doodle a person wearing a great dress or a sleek tux and think “Huh, should’ve gone into the glamorous world of Fashion” as you go back to the monitor? The fashion industry may seem like a place where graphic designers work at salt mines as the fashion designer overlords whip them into doing their bidding. But the reality is quite more fun.Remember CAD from when we were discussing Architecture? Turns out, designing clothing and buildings is very similar.When designing a fabric, people who work with CAD can manifest their ideas into virtual 3D and 2D models which gives them an edge over those who need to draw up their designs and take time to make adjustments for conversion into 3D. Using CAD also allows you to play with colors without having to change your drawing board every time.Graphic designers have become the backbone of any fashion company and are one of the most important employees. So let that inner Coco Chanel, Karl Lagerfeld or Manish Malhotra out and dominate the competition.AgricultureFarming is usually either seen as a job with only instruments and basic tools or fully automated and advanced technology and no human element. The truth lies somewhere in between. While the human touch is a necessity in the fields, programmers have brought great advancements in agriculture.Pest recognition technology which is similar to face recognition technology is being used to identify plant diseases. Factors such as weather, plant susceptibility, and knowledge from other farmers being fed into AI helps farmers everywhere by substituting years of a single farmer’s experience with knowledge from hundreds of them.LegalDo you like following the rules and regulations set by the government? Do you like watching Law and Order, Suits, or Better Call Saul? Did you want to become a lawyer but couldn’t go through with the studies?Well now’s your chance to set forth a step into legal work. Document review, an important step in fighting any case, is the examination of the data and documents provided to see whether they are relevant or not. This is usually done manually by many firms but through technological advancements, many are trying to make the process virtual using eDiscovery programs.Legal documentation costs a lot of time and money to be outsourced, but it can be freely and instantly availed on the internet, thanks to the programmers-who have developed service platforms that are accurate and can work without pay.Many Law firms are looking for programmers that can help build their Virtual presence and make lawyer-client interaction virtual and faster to make work effortless.SalesLast but not the least, if you’re interested in sales and have a knack for it, then you will be happy to know this is also an industry where your skills in programming will come in handy.Tech-integrated sales have blossomed since the beginning of the century with more and more businesses accepting software to manual work. A programmer who knows his applications through and through becomes a valuable asset to any sales team he is part of.Even if you don’t want to deal with customers directly, Data analysis and processing algorithms are a fine way to take into the industry.The bottom line is that a programmer who feels restricted to developing solely in the technology sector has just not explored enough. You don’t have to give up your passion just because you didn’t specifically get educated in that field. A Programmer is like a jack of all trades; you just have to put your mind to it and you will definitely find applications for your knowledge in your passion.Turing NinjasBlog on kids, coding, and skills needed in the digital age.Follow32 Digital AgeArtificial IntelligenceRoboticsAutomationCoding32 claps32 clapsWritten byTuring NinjasFollowCode to the future!FollowTuring NinjasFollowBlog on kids, coding, and skills needed in the digital age.FollowWritten byTuring NinjasFollowCode to the future!Turing NinjasFollowBlog on kids, coding, and skills needed in the digital age.More From MediumHow to Make Your Website Themeable With CSS VariablesAli Kamalizade in Better ProgrammingThe ‘Poetry’ of RubyYoichi NaganoNew! 10x more awesome ways to write JSON configuration using Jsonnet.Gourav Kumar in ServianHow To Migrate SQL Server Jobs From One SQL Server Instance To Another{coding}SightMicroservice Architecture with Azure Spring CloudAnil Kumar GOTTAMBuild a Scalable Data Pipeline with AWS Kinesis, AWS Lambda, and Google BigQueryHeather Fan in The StartupLearning to Code is Like Learning to Play an InstrumentTyler Harris in An Idea (by Ingenious Piece)Functional Algorithms In ScalaMuse MekuriaLearn more.Medium is an open platform where 170 million readers come to find insightful and dynamic thinking."
It’s Alive! Researchers Find Roombas Have A Personality.,https://medium.com/@alison-escalante/its-alive-researchers-find-roombas-have-a-personality-46b59a8b53b?source=tag_archive---------5-----------------------,"Personality,AI,Body Language,Robotics,Innovation","Roombas do more than vacuum, they also delight us with personality. Photo: @jankolario on twitter/UnsplashHave you ever suspected that your Roomba is alive? You are not alone. New research confirms that people can tell what kind of personality a robot vacuum has, just by the way it moves. Even better, people correctly guessed which of Snow White’s Seven Dwarves the robot was mimicking. And that’s the kind of delightful finding that makes me happy.It’s nothing new for people to fall in love with their robot vacuum. There’s your coworker, who shares stories of the cute things their Roomba did last night. Or the beloved DJ Roomba episodes on Parks and Recreation. Even twitter is peppered with entertaining moments in human robot vacuum relationships.Pets also love RoombaAll of those Roomba owners seem a little crazy, until you get your own. Suddenly you too are convinced that the little disc shaped robot who lives off dirt has a relationship with you. You are not imagining things; scientists agree with you.Robot vacuum researchRobot vacuum research is nothing new, and neither is research into human robot relations. Researchers want to know how humans relate to robots, especially when it comes to what makes us trust them. You read that correctly: a huge goal in robot development is to build trust with people.In the past, research has shown that people who are lonely can relate to their Roomba like a friend, especially if it looks like it’s smiling. And people’s sense of connection with robots may be intensified by high pressure situations. In another study, highly trained soldiers who worked with robots to disarm bombs appeared to form an emotional attachment. The soldiers knew it was a tool, but still interacted with it more like a pet. If a robot became disabled, they might say, ‘poor little guy,’ or even have a funeral for it.Robot vacuums with personalities.In a new study, researchers wanted to know how people perceived the movement patterns of robot vacuums. That’s because the way someone moves tells us a lot about their mood.The team used an ‘expressive autonomous motion generation system’ to program Neato Botvacs with movement patterns. Using path shape, acceleration, and movement toward or away from people, the robots imitated three of the Seven Dwarves.According to Heather Knight, assistant professor of computer science at Oregon State University, “The Happy robot sought people out with smooth motions at moderate speed. The Sleepy robot also sought people out, but with delays and slower accelerations. The Grumpy robot avoided people while using erratic motions and a range of velocities. Those simple variations told the people a lot.”Study participants were indeed able to correctly identify whether the robot vacuums was Happy, Grumpy or Sleepy, just based on their movement. They also rated their politeness, friendliness and intelligence. Participants found Grumpy impolite and unfriendly, while they rated Happy as friendly and intelligent.If it moves, we ask if it’s alive.Our brain developed patterns of recognition in a world where most of what moved was alive. We learned that other creatures’ movement revealed their intentions. When we react to a robot, we are providing a window into how our own minds developed.But also, these little guys are just fun. If one of the key factors in our happiness is whether we have regular opportunities for fun, then maybe we should all think about getting a Roomba.Grab a copy of The Ultimate Parenting Checklist.

"Kenalan sama Machine Learning , yuk!",https://medium.com/@imeldaazahraa/kenalan-sama-machine-learning-yuk-eecdd516e431?source=tag_archive---------6-----------------------,"Kecerdasan Buatan,Artificial Intelligence,Machine Learning,Robotics,Deep Learning","Pasti sering dengerkan tentang teknologi yang lagi naik daun seiring dengan perkembangan teknologi yang semakin pesat, siapa lagi kalo bukan si Kecerdasan Buatan atau Artificial Intelligence ? Nah singkatnya, kecerdasan buatan itu adalah sebuah sistem yang membuat komputer bisa punya kemampuan yang umumnya dimiliki sama manusia. Dengan ML, komputer akan belajar dari data. Antar tiap data bisa aja sama, tapi pendekatan dan algoritmanya bisa aja berbeda untuk mendapatkan hasil yang optimal. Pada machine learning, data adalah makanan pokok yang wajib kita punya. Data terbagi menjadi 2 yaitu data training dan data testing. Data training nantinya akan melatih komputer untuk dapat mengetest dan mendapatkan model tertentu yang selanjutnya akan didapat di tahapan testing.Kecerdasan buatan sering banget kita temui di kehidupan sehari-hari. Misalnya pada robot, finger print, face detector, asisten virtual, sampe beranda youtube yang muncul sesuai apa yang sering kita cari. Wah keren banget ya ??Nah, jadi Machine learning (ML) ini adalah salah satu cabang dari Artificial Intelligence (Kecerdasan Buatan). Singkatnya, ML memiliki arti yang lebih spesifik daripada AI yaitu menggunakan metode statistika tertentu untuk membuat komputer dapat mempelajari model pola tertentu terhadap data. ML memanfaatkan data untuk meningkatkan performa dari model tersebut.Jenis-Jenis Machine Learning1. Supervised LearningPada jenis ini sudah tersedia data test dan variabel yang sudah dilabelkan. Misalnya, kita punya sebuah kucing persia, Ia memiliki atribut badan kecil, berat 1kg, bulu halus dan gigi tidak tajam. Kucing persia ini nantinya kita kenal dengan label “Kucing Persia”. Dengan kata lain, kita mengelompkkkan sebuah data ke data yang sudah ada. Supervised learning dapat didefinisikan sebagai robot yang berusaha secara mandiri menjawab pertanyaan sesuai jawaban yang umumnya manusia tau tanpa si robot dikasih jawaban sama manusia. Beberapa teknik supervised yaitu classification, decision tree, regression, naive bayes classifier, random forest, support vector machine.2. Unsupervised LearningPada jenis ini tidak terdapat data test dan tidak punya label. ML jenis ini akan belajar sendiri untuk membuat suatu label dan mengeompokkan data menjadi beberapa bagian. Beberapa teknik Unsupervised learning ada clustering, elbow, recommendation, dimensionality reduction, K-means, DBSCAN, Self-Organizing Map, Fuzzy C-Means, Hierarchical Clusster.3. Semi-Supervised LearningNah kalo jenis ini, nama nya juga “semi” jadi diantara iya dan tidak! ML jenis ini akan dilatih berdasarkan campuran data yang udah ada labelnya maupun data yang gak berlabel. Jadi dia ini gabungan Supervised learning dan Unsupervised learning.4. Reinforcement LearningPada jenis ini komputer akan belajar hal baru dari tanpa bantuan manusia. Jadi prosesnya kaya game, Ia akan bekerja mempelajari sebuah data untuk bisa bekerja sendiri. Namun, dalam proses pembelajarannya Ia membutuhkan waktu yang tidak pasti (terkadang lama euy). Metode ini diterapkan pada model cerdas agar Ia dapat menyesuaikan dengan kondisi lingkungannya.Oke, setelah ini kita langsung latihan ke salah satu pengimplementasian tiap teknik-teknik nya aja ya biar bisa langsung paham! :)Pembahasan “Membuat Model Linear Regression (Supervised Learning — ML)” klik https://link.medium.com/uQUtw8FDY8Semangat belajar data ya untuk bisa ML^^Written byImelda Zahra Tungga DewiJust a simple girl who loves the earth🌍🍃 I'm interest in electronics, instrumentation, data science and some things related to computational science💹Follow1 1 1 Kecerdasan BuatanArtificial IntelligenceMachine LearningRoboticsDeep LearningMore from Imelda Zahra Tungga DewiFollowJust a simple girl who loves the earth🌍🍃 I'm interest in electronics, instrumentation, data science and some things related to computational science💹More From MediumHow to implement an Adam Optimizer from ScratchEnoch Kan in Towards Data ScienceWhat we learn vs. what we knowWalid Saba, PhD in OntoLogikA Deep Conceptual Guide to Mutual InformationSean McClureGraph classification by computer visionInsaf Ashrapov in Towards Data ScienceDonald Trump Won, No Matter What Happens NextJessica Wildfire in The Apeiron Blog(Why) There Was no Biden Landslideumair haque in Eudaimonia and CoThe Election Should Never Have Been This Closeumair haque in Eudaimonia and Co20 Things Most People Learn Too Late In LifeNicolas Cole in Better AdviceAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Programming a robot to navigate and detect obstacles,https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/programming-a-home-robot-vector-to-navigate-and-detect-obstacles-a2a46d140bc5?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Deep Learning,Machine Learning,Robotics,Computer Science,Programming","In this post, we will see how to make a tiny home robot to behave like a self-driving car using its camera and distance sensor to detect obstacles and navigate.I recently bought Vector, a tiny home robot that can be programmed using its dedicated SDK. Out of curiosity, I wanted to test its sensors, and so I programmed it a bit. It is a basic code, where Vector detects obstacles using its distance sensor and then calls the object detector to identify what it detected. To be noted, this part is very important for self-driving cars, where it needs to identify the types of obstacles and take the necessary decision. Here, Vector takes a decision by stoping itself after detecting an obstacle, and then it tries to identify it before changing its direction.I have made a video of Vector after programming which you can check in the link below:Object Detector and Anki Distance SensorObject Detector in Vector: The detector network consists of a ResNet with a Region proposal network and can detect more than 600 object categories. That means the Vector will be able to identify a large number of objects.A sample image of objects detected by the robot.Anki Vector Distance Sensor Proximity Commands:We will use the following two commands to get Infra-Red (IR) readings to estimate the distance of obstacles in front of the Vector.robot.proximity.last_sensor_reading.distance (To get the distance)getting distance_mm and distance_inch (Change distance to mm or inch)Dependencies: The main dependencies are based on my testing platform using python 3.6, but you can change them according to the machine in which you will be implementing.Tensorflow — 1.12.0 (you can install both CPU or GPU version)Keras-2.2.4OpenCV3Vector SDKDownloading and Installing the ModuleInstall Vector SDK: The Vector SDK gives access to various capabilities of this robot, such as computer vision, Artificial intelligence and navigation. You can design your programs to make this robot imbibed with certain AI capabilities. Before running the module, install the vector SDK by following the information on this page: https://developer.anki.com/vector/docs/index.html.Please clone or download this repository into your local machine following the instructions mentioned there. After downloading, you need to authenticate the vector robot so that the SDK can interact with Vector. To authenticate with the robot, type the following into the Terminal window.python3 -m anki_vector.configurePlease note that the robot and your computer should be connected to the same network. Now, you will be asked to enter your robot’s name, IP address and serial number, which you can find in the robot itself. Also, You will be asked for your Anki login and password which you used to set up your Vector. After following these steps, you will be provided with a certificate, and you can use it for further programming.3. IF you see “SUCCESS!” then your robot is connected to your computer, and you can see the Vector in action. Now, You can open a Jupyter notebook and run the commands as follows, or download the VectorNavigation.ipynb (Link below)https://github.com/surajitsaikia27/Vector_robot_ObjectDetection/blob/master/VectorNavigation.ipynbA: Let's start by importing the librariesimport timefrom main.model.detect_odr import object_detectionfrom PIL import Imageimport anki_vectorfrom anki_vector.util import degreesimport anki_vector.camerafrom anki_vector.util import degrees, distance_mm, speed_mmpsimport collectionsimage_name = ""detect.jpg""B: Next, we define the function which calls the object detector to obtain the labels of objects in front of the robot.def get_classnames(image_path):    """"""    This function calls the object detection library to detect 600 objects    :param image_path:    :return: class labels    """"""    try:        classes = object_detection(image_path)        if len(classes) == 0:            return 'no objects'        class_list = []        for class_names in classes:           class_list.append(class_names)        return ', '.join(class_list)    except:        return 'no objects'C: Create a Deque to store the last three sensor readings to avoid noises.# Create a deque to store last three distance values to deal with random noisesdeq = collections.deque([15, 15, 15],3)D: Navigate Vector:Note: This is a basic code, where I just tried to check the sensors and camera feed of the robot.

Bu makalede ise Rehabilitasyon mühendisliğinde kullanılan robotik teknolojilerden bahsedeceğim.Rehabilitasyon hastalık ve yaralanma nedeniyle fiziksel, duyuşsal ve zihinsel yeteneklerini kaybetmiş hastalara bu yeteneklerin geri kazandırılmasını ve tıbben tedavi edilemeyen eksikliklerinin yerini doldurmayı amaçlar [1].Omurilik (spinal cord) yaralanmaları, kısmî veya tam felç, kaslarla ilgili ameliyat ve diz artroplastisi gibi cerrahi operasyonlardan sonra hastalar hareket yeteneklerini (mobilizasyon) iyileştirmek için rehabilitasyona ihtiyaç duyarlar [2].Yine bir önceki makalede ayrıntılarından bahsettiğim gibi rehabilitasyona ihtiyaç duyanların sayısı her geçen gün artmaktadır. Buna paralel olarak rehabilitasyon alanında kullanılan ekipmanlar ve teknikler de gelişmektedir.Öte yandan biyomedikal mühendisliği; makine, elektrik-elektronik, bilgisayar ve tıp bilimlerinin birleşiminden oluşan disiplinler arası bir daldır. Biyomedikalin önemli uygulama alanlarından biri de rehabilitasyondur. Özellikle rehabilitasyon işleminde fiziksel egzersizler, hareket desteği, hasta hareketliliği (mobilizasyon) ve günlük yaşam aktiviteleri ile ilgili konularda önemli ölçüde yarar sağlamaktadır.Biyomekanik, biyomedikalin bir alt çalışma konusudur. (Daha ayrıntılı bilgi için biyomekanik üzerine yazdığım makaleyi gözden geçirmenizde fayda var.)Biyomekanik, insan vücut fonksiyonlarının düzgün şekilde işlemesine yardımcı olan veya bu fonksiyonların tamamen yerini alan mekanik sistemlerin geliştirilmesini amaçlar.Bir biyomekanik sistem beş üniteden meydana gelir:MekanizmaTahrik elemanı (aktüatör = eyleyici)Denetleyici (kontrolör)Mekanik algılayıcılar (mekanosensörler)Biyolojik algılayıcılar (biyosensörler)Mekanizma, sistemin mekanik yapısıdır. Makine mühendisliğinin konusu olup uygun şekilde tasarlanması ve uygun malzemeden imal edilmesi gerekir.Tahrik elemanları, mekanizmalara hareket veren elemanlardır. Motorlar, hidrolik ve pnömatik sistemler bunlara örnek olarak verilebilir. Örneğin tahrik elemanı, bir robot mekanizmasında yapay kas görevini yapar ve insan vücudunun doğal fonksiyonlarının yerini almak ya da bu fonksiyonlara yardımcı olmak için kuvvet veya hareket üretirler [3].Denetleyici, biyomekanik sistemin denetlenmesinden (kontrol) sorumludur. Tüm üniteler arasındaki haberleşmeyi sağlar. Günümüzde denetleyici olarak mikroişlemciler, mikrodenetleyiciler, gömülü sistemler vb cihazlar kullanılmaktadır. Sistem yazılımı denetleyici bünyesinde koşturulur.Mekanik algılayıcılar(mekanosensörler), sistemdeki mekanik parametreleri ölçer. Bu parametrelere örnek olarak konum, kuvvet, hız, basınç veya tork verilebilir.Biyolojik algılayıcılar(biyosensörler), insan vücudundan alınan geri besleme bilgilerini elektriksel işaretlere dönüştürür. Bu geri besleme bilgisi kan basıncı, insülin seviyesi, kas veya beyin aktivasyon sinyali gibi sinyaller olabilir.Rehabilitasyon robotları biyomekaniğin önemli uygulama alanlarından biridir. Özellikle son on beş yılda, rehabilitasyon robot çalışmalarının sayısı, tahrik elemanları, sensörler, bilgisayar ve sinyal işleme teknolojilerindeki gelişmelere paralel olarak artmıştır.Rehabilitasyonda robotların kullanımının bazı önemli nedenleri şunlardır:Robotlar, rehabilitasyondaki periyodik hareketleri kolaylıkla, aynı şartlarda, istenildiği kadar gerçekleştirebilir.Robotlar, ön tanımlı kuvvetleri oluşturabilir ve bu kuvvetlerin kontrolünü kararlılığı sürekli kılarak gerçekleştirebilir.Robotlar aynı terapi koşullarını bir rehabilitasyon uzmanına göre daha kesin ve doğru yerine getirebilir.Robotlar bir insana göre sensörleri sayesinde daha nesnel (objektif) ölçüm yapabilir.Robotlar sayesinde, bir uzman gözetiminde birden fazla hasta tedavi imkânı bulabilir.Gelişen internet alt yapıları kullanılarak, uzaktan programlanabilen robotlar sayesinde hastalar evlerinde tedavi imkanı bulabilirler.Rehabilitasyon robotları dört ana grupta incelenebilir:Destekleyici (Yardımcı) Rehabilitasyon Robotiği: Engelli insanlara günlük yaşamsal aktivitelerinde bedensel ve zihinsel destek olurlar.Ortez ve protezler: Tedavi sürecinde eklem rahatlatırlar veya uzuvların yerine geçerler.Terapatik egzersiz robotları: Hastalara terapatik egzersizleri yaptırırlar.Kognitif (zihinsel) robotik: Yaşlı ve çocuklara zihinsel destek ve moral desteği verirler.Buraya kadar rehabilitasyon robotiğine kısa bir giriş yaptık. Bir sonraki yazıda rehabilitasyon robotlarını daha detaylı tanıtacak, gerçekleştirilen rehabilitasyon robot çalışma örnekleri üzerinden yukarıda yapılan sınıflamaya göre rehabilitasyon robotiğini açıklayacağım.Kaynakça:[1] http://www.ehendrick.org/healthy, Haziran 2010[2] Bradly et al., 2000; Inal, 2000; Metrailler et al., 2007; Okada et al., 2000; Reinkensmeyer, 2003 and http://www.manchesterneurophysio.co.uk, Kasım 2010[3] http://www.ece.ncsu.edu/research/bee/biomd, NDWritten byDeniz AkBiomedical Engineer | www.linkedin.com/in/denizakFollow50 50 50 RoboticsRobotik RehabilitasyonRehabilitasyonRobotikBiyomedikal MühendisliğiMore from Deniz AkFollowBiomedical Engineer | www.linkedin.com/in/denizakMore From MediumDonald Trump Won, No Matter What Happens NextJessica Wildfire in The Apeiron Blog(Why) There Was no Biden Landslideumair haque in Eudaimonia and Co20 Things Most People Learn Too Late In LifeNicolas Cole in Better AdviceThe Election Should Never Have Been This Closeumair haque in Eudaimonia and Co“Anyone but Bernie”, They Said.Lauren Martinchek in Dialogue & DiscourseI Worked the Polls in Trump Country — and Left More Confused Than EverAaron Gell in GENThe Democrats Were Suckered Into Mail-In VotingDavid Leibowitz in Dialogue & DiscourseThis Is ‘I Wish a Motherf*cker Would’ Week for Black PeopleMarley K. in ZORAAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
"<strong class=""dk"">What Is a Workhorse Robot?</strong>",https://medium.com/thawtspot/what-is-a-workhorse-robot-ca747f44e085?source=tag_archive---------2-----------------------,"Amr,Agv,Robotics,Robots,Autonomous Vehicles","Toro NewsroomOver the years, robots have been sliced and diced into many categories: industrial, personal/consumer, autonomous vehicles (AVs), drones, educational, entertainment, medical, humanoid, underwater … and the list goes on. While people imagine the future having robots in many aspects of life, historically, they have had most traction in manufacturing logistics. In this area, these are the common categories of robots:Industrial robot: This robot is generally fixed to the floor of manufacturing plants or warehouses. A classic example is the manufacturing arm, in which robots were manually preprogrammed to perform repetitive tasks with no sensing of the environment around them. With recent innovations in computer vision and haptic sensors, industrial robots are becoming smarter.Automated guided vehicle (AGV): Like the industrial robot, the AGV also commonly operated on manufacturing and warehouse floors with little embedded intelligence. It requires some type of guidance system in a perfectly controlled environment — for example, a painted line that it follows or a buried wire.Autonomous mobile robot (AMR): This newer, smarter vehicle operates in similar environments as the AGV. The AMR uses sensors that allow it to better perceive its surrounding environment, thereby allowing the AMR to operate in more dynamic environments and better collaborate with humans.I don’t know about you, but I find these categories pretty confusing. Why is an industrial robot always thought of as fixed versus being mobile? And now that everything from your toaster to your car is becoming smarter, AMR is an extremely vague definition for a robot.It might help to take a look at the history of robots to understand how we got here.While the term “robot” has been around for the last 100 years (the term was first used in a 1921 play called “Rossum’s Universal Robots”), it was not until the 1980s that robots moved from science fiction to actually being used in industry. This is when the first wave of robot arms began being used in manufacturing plants. This kicked off the category of industrial robots: manually programmed robots that had few, if any, sensors for environmental input. At the time, industrial robots had little intelligence and mindlessly repeated the actions they were programmed to accomplish. Interestingly, at the same time, university research was started in leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to enable self-driving cars. In 1986, Carnegie Mellon University launched NavLab, one of the first “cars” designed to be driven by a computer. It actually was a large van packed with five racks of computers, including a Warp supercomputer.It was at this time that AGVs also showed up on manufacturing floors — the mobile counterpart to the fixed industrial robot. Other than these two industrial use cases, for the next 20 years, robots stayed in the university labs. One small exception to this was toy robots, but they represented a small percentage of the robot market.Through the 1990s and early 2000s, there were incremental improvements to industrial robots and AGVs but no significant change in how they worked. In the last decade, AGVs started to be replaced with AMRs — named to indicate they were mobile — and instead of simply being guided, they had the ability to sense and autonomously interact with more dynamic environments compared to their simple-minded AGV predecessors. So, as you can see, much of the context around the differences between industrial robots, AGVs and AMRs is based on the history of this equipment being used in manufacturing logistics.Now that AI and computer-vision-driven perception is being used to guide all sorts of equipment and vehicles — mobile robots in warehouses, delivery robots on sidewalks, robot boats, self-driving cars, autonomous drones, etc. — terms like AV, primarily used for cars, and AMR, primarily used for smart mobile logistics robots, are sloppy category names. I instead propose that we use a broader label — “smart things” — to define all vehicles, equipment or other things that leverage sensors, AI and other processing to perceive and interact with the world around them. Smart things include robots and can be nicely mapped across these two dimensions: fixed versus mobile and work/task oriented versus social/entertainment oriented. See the following diagram.In this diagram, the green items are more consumer oriented, while the other colors are more business oriented. The green items are all terms that are in use today. The distinction between autonomous trucks and autonomous cars should be self-explanatory. Industrial robots are the descendants of the dumb, fixed industrial robots of the 1980s, which will continue to incorporate evermore increasing sensing and intelligence. Workhorse robots, in red, is the newest term.A workhorse robot is a fully autonomous, skill-specific vehicle that leverages much of the AI and computer vision technology historically driven by self-driving car research. These robots are the next-generation AMRs, built to cover tasks that extend way beyond the traditional logistics space that AMRs previously operated in. I predict some of the most interesting business opportunities over the next several years will be in workhorse robots. As the cost of perception technology shrinks enough to support mass adoption, the economics of these robots will support all sorts of tasks never before possible to machine automateA workhorse robot is a fully autonomous, skill-specific vehicle that leverages much of the AI and computer vision technology historically driven by self-driving car research.I believe that all the categories of robots and other smart things can fall into one of the bubbles in the diagram, but let’s take a deeper dive into the types of solutions that can fall under workhorse robots.Agriculture: GPS-guided tractors have been available for years; now, robots can help with more advanced tasks in the field from weeding to plant health inspection.Construction: Robots can aid in repetitive but somewhat complex tasks from digging and moving materials around outside to building walls and structures for real estate construction.Retail/customer service: Retail solutions include tasks such as stock inspection, restocking and even helping customers as mobile information kiosks.Cleaning: This category has exploded in popularity with the COVID-19 pandemic. Robots disinfect surfaces in plants and retail stores or sweep or mop floors, parking lots and sidewalks.Inspection, surveying and security: These robots can inspect and survey areas that are dangerous or difficult for humans to access. Robots lead to more accuracy because they can repeat tasks more reliably, operate for long periods of time without breaks and provide more comprehensive coverage.Logistics and delivery: More intelligent workhorse robots can help with logistics and delivery tasks in much more dynamic environments than their AGV predecessors. As the cost and complexity of operating these robots decrease, the more efficiencies can be gained.Medical: These robots perform tasks in hospitals and other health care facilities. They can perform delivery tasks, administer medication and monitor patients’ status. They can operate longer with more precision and fewer mistakes than humans doing similar tasks. They also can operate with less risk of disease or other infection transmissions.Military and field: These robots can be used in combat or military reconnaissance or be sent to locations difficult for humans to get to for exploration tasks (for example, space and other planets, deep-ocean exploration or extremely remote locations).While these vertical solutions are primarily described from a business viewpoint — there are also consumer versions of workhorse robots. For example, consumer agriculture solutions include lawn mowing; consumer cleaning includes robot vacuums and window washers.To conclude, my hope is defining this new space of smart things, in addition to the category and sub-categories of workhorse robots, helps to provide a better framework for talking about the progression of robots and smart equipment and how they will impact our lives. It’s time to move beyond the more ambiguous terminology developed from the historical robot evolution in the manufacturing logistics space.Leo is the chief innovation officer at DataTribe, a cybersecurity and AI/ML startup foundry: “A place where the world’s best come to build dominant companies.”ThawtSpotInsights on Technology, Innovation & StartupsFollowAmrAgvRoboticsRobotsAutonomous VehiclesWritten byLeo The CTOFollowTechnologist, Entrepreneur, Innovation EnthusiastFollowThawtSpotFollowA spot to share thoughts about technology, innovation and startups.FollowWritten byLeo The CTOFollowTechnologist, Entrepreneur, Innovation EnthusiastThawtSpotFollowA spot to share thoughts about technology, innovation and startups.More From MediumNLP Bias Against People with DisabilitiesCatherine Yeo in Fair BytesThe simplest explanation of machine learning you’ll ever readCassie Kozyrkov in HackerNoon.com#AIpower Episode 1: Myths & Realities of AISégolène Husson in Earthcube StoriesAutomated Live Chat Agents Are Going To Take Our Jobs.

Deskbot Part 3: 3D Modelling,https://medium.com/meseta-robots/deskbot-part-3-3d-modelling-578386f6c965?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"Robotics,Cad,Sketchup,Python,Arduino","In order to do proper path planning and collision checking, any robotics stack needs to have an understanding of the geometry and arrangement of joints in a robot. Also, to help with design, it’s also helpful to have a visual representation of the robot as well so that we can compare what we’re seeing in the real world with what’s going on in the robot’s stack easier.To achieve this, I will model up the robot in 3D, and export two models — a visual representation of the part to help me, the human, do debugging. And a simplified blocky representation of the robot that will be used for collision calculations. This collision model should be simple to reduce computational complexity.The software: SketchUp free versionThe software I will use for this is Sketchup’s free online version. I’ve been a long-time Sketchup user, as a relatively simple and free tool for 3D printing. It’s not quite parametric like other CAD software, but it suits my purposes just fine. I’ve used various CAD tools in the past owing to my previous work as an engineer working with motors, but I can’t say no to Free.At some point in 2018 or 2019, Sketchup pulled support for their free downloaded product, and went full-time online. I had initial reservations for this, never before having used an online version of desktop software that was any good. But surprisingly, Sketchup’s online version is quite close in functionality to their downloaded version. Aside from slight niggling of the smaller toolbox hiding more tool options in hover menus that make it slower to switch tools, it does mostly the same thing as before.The modelling processI checked for some engineering drawings or existing CAD for this robot online, and there seems to be multiple versions of it, with slightly varying dimensions. I’ve checked the dimensions of those online versions against the robot and they don’t all match, so I’m guessing this design has been widely copied and varied across manufacturers, and unless I can get the actual CAD this particular manufacturer I use, there’s always going to be some uncertainty.Therefore, I’m going to just reproduce the robot from measurements myself.I also have to reproduce the MG996R servos, which again, are supposed to be a standard size, but vary slightly. So I’ve measured the ones I have and have produced a model for them. It’s nice to be able to put the two parts together in CAD, and then measure clearances and distances between the geometries, and validate that they are what they are in real life — it means I’ve reasonably accurately measured and reproduced the model.Here’s a quick timelapse of creating a part. It doesn’t take too long to do once measurements are taken. As you can see, with Sketchup not being parametric, a lot of the modelling process involves dropping guides out to the correct distances first, and punching in numerical values (note the input box in the bottom right, this is how you usually get exact measurements in Sketchup). This makes editing parts later a bit more challenging, but again, for a simple project like this, it serves the purpose fine.The completed partsThe parts are completed. For the gripper, I went with a simplified model, since this was for visual appearances only. The interesting thing about the gripper is that it’s a somewhat complex mechanism, that is meant to be in collision sometimes, so I’m keeping it modelled in its fully open position for now.Also note that I haven’t modelled in any of the screws, but I have modelled in the holes. The reason for this is that the holes can be used to help align the parts when assembled, but the screws are just an unnecessary additional level of detail. The screws do stick out slightly and should be factored in in the collision model, but this can be done by just expanding the bounding box a little.The parts can now be put together in their assemblies, and grouped together by the parts that are rigidly connected, so that they can be exported as groups.CollisionsTo model the collisions, for each group, I make an approximate blocky representation, trying to keep to mostly blocks. Each block is a little bigger than the model they contain. The most important part is that the blocks are correctly sized so that they don’t overlap at the joints, otherwise the robot will complain that it is always in self-collision and fail to make any moves.Note that none of the wires are correctly modelled. This is sometimes a problem, but flexible parts like wires are notoriously difficult to deal with, and the best option has been to manage the cables in a way that they won’t easily become tangled in the robot or the environment. Ideally robots have internal cables, but a simple robot like this, I’ll mostly be using a method of “hope it doesn’t happen, and when it does, apply more zipties and duct tape”With all the modelling completed, I will export as .stl files and in the next part I’ll start constructing the robot’s URDF to put these models into the robot workspace.Meseta builds RobotsMeseta builds some robots and blogs about themFollowRoboticsCadSketchupPythonArduinoWritten byYuan Gao (Meseta)Follow🤖 Build robots, code in python.

Deskbot: Part 2 — Assembly,https://medium.com/meseta-robots/deskbot-part-2-assembly-f7a2e60513bc?source=tag_archive---------4-----------------------,"Robotics,Automation,Electronics,Python,Arduino","My order of parts has arrived. The frame and gripper are made of cut and bent aluminium (I suspect it’s water-jet cut rather than laser) and has quite a nice matte finish on it. Everything is held together by M3 machine screws, and the nuts are plain and not locking except on the gripper. I expect to have to periodically tighten them.The gripper part came pre-assembled. It has an interesting linkage that keeps the gripper jaws parallel while opening and closing, and is actuated by one servo. However, all the joints are just screws. Unfortunately this means that it’s necessary to get the screw tightness just right to avoid seizing up the joint, but not too loose so that the joint rattles around.Once installed, I was able to use the servo control board’s software to move the servos around.This is when I realised that USB power alone wasn’t going to cut it, and that I’d need to get a better power supply for when I start using the robot for real. I ordered one from Amazon, which turned out to come with an eye-searingly bright display.Bench supplies are excellent supplies for projects due to their variable output, and over-current/constant-current protection. I’m much more willing to possibly short out a bench supply, which can easily protect itself and also show me the problem, than a regular power brick which could silently die/melt/explode.With a proper supply, I put together the rest of the robotThe windows-based servo control tool that came with the board lets me record and play back stored moves, so even with this rudimentary set up it was possible to do some fun things.But we’re just getting started here. Playing back pre-recorded servo moves is just the start.However, as the video shows, there’s a significant amount of wobble in the design. The whole thing sits on a single servo in the base, so as you go up the arm, each servo is progressively carrying more and more load, until you get to the base servo, which carries the entire load of the arm on its axle, surely not a good option for any kind of load-carrying work. It feels like the whole arm can easily snap off the servo at this point, and is likely to need to be reinforced somehow. I would be far more comfortable if the arm sat on a turntable with appropriately wide thrust bearings, and with the servo only providing the torque for turning.Furthermore, the shoulder servo, the next one up from the base, is carrying a lot of torque of the arm when out-stretched. This servo is likely to need to be the highest torque rated servo in the robot. I’m currently using the inexpensive servos rated at 12kg/cm torque. 12kg seems high, but the arm extends to over 24cm long, meaning actual load-carrying capability of the robot when fully outstretched is just 0.5kg which if you factor in the weight of the robot itself, means it would only be able to lift maybe 200g of load, and that’s assuming the motors are actually able to generate this torque. So in the worst case, we would want to up-rate the shoulder servo. The other servos like the elbow are much less impacted as it only has half the moment arm, and also less load, so its torque requirements are much lower.Incidentally, having assembled this robot, I’ve started seeing it everywhere, like on the homepage of Coursera, or some blog about robotics in medicine.In the next part, I’ll start doing some 3D modelling so that I can put an accurate representation of the robot into ROS so that I can do proper self-collision detection and path planning.Meseta builds RobotsMeseta builds some robots and blogs about themFollowRoboticsAutomationElectronicsPythonArduinoWritten byYuan Gao (Meseta)Follow🤖 Build robots, code in python.

Il est capable de trotter, de bondir vers l’avant ou l’arrière, d’encaisser des chutes ou encore d’escalader des murs. HAMR-Jr se déplace aussi bien vers la droite, que vers la gauche. Pour le concevoir, les chercheurs ont utilisé le même procédé que pour les origamis : ils ont découpé le châssis du robot dans une feuille de fibre de carbone en 2D (dans laquelle sont gravés les systèmes microélectromécaniques à circuits imprimés), qu’ils ont ensuite replié pour obtenir une structure 3D.À terme, l’équipe d’ingénieurs espère que les micro-robots puissent aider à la surveillance de zones inaccessibles aux humains dans lesquelles ils pourraient se déplacer facilement de part leur petit gabarit.Découvrez notre fonds d’investissement spécialisé dans le secteur de la robotique : TRECENTO ROBOTIQUE ISR.Les performances passées ne préjugent pas des performances futures.

But still, it has slow progress. May be due to the unclear perception of the concept. Before we swim deeper on robotics education, let’s try to understand its importance here. Moreover,What could be in future with A.I RobotsTherefore, I am requesting you to be little imaginary here. What if A.I. robots involve more into our day to day life. And you would say it has already being involved. Yes, robotics are in operation now more than we expected. What if Robots become servants at your home and you are expected to operate them and maintain them.Additionally, What if friendly A.I robot become quite violent. And seller of the robot has advised to you some code alteration! But if you are just alien to the subject..!! You and I cannot tell, this is not going to be true in the future.Do you know about A.I Robot Sofia or Bina 48? Sofia and Bina 48 gave creepy answers when they were interviewed. Truly nobody expected such a response from them. Not only that, what about Chatbot Tay? she was shut down in 16 hours after the launch due to chatbot became more offensive and racist.Make ready your kids for the future with robotics educationHowever, future of the Robotic has already stated, our kids are going to live there without our protection. Don’t you think now robotics education is a timely important topic?Apart from those factors, let’s talk about definite factors. You and I graduated into the world which still manageable without much robotics involvement. But our children will step into the workforce which rife in robotics.Therefore, They should be more compatible with those technologies to survive in professional life and their private life. Hence, children’s lifetime will more run through subjects such as Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics also known as STEM.Read More : https://www.techtravely.com/technology/ai/importance-of-robotics-education-for-kids/Originally published at https://www.techtravely.com on August 22, 2020.Written byTechtravelyhttps://www.techtravely.com/FollowRoboticsTechnologyKidsTech For KidsAIMore from TechtravelyFollowhttps://www.techtravely.com/More From MediumOur undergraduate program is racistAmy J.

Rviz on docker,https://medium.com/intro-to-artificial-intelligence/rviz-on-docker-bdf4d0fca5b?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Robotics,Software Development,Artificial Intelligence","Rviz window[2]Codebase: ROS MelodicPrerequisite: install docker 19.03 or aboveDocker container is really useful for the rapid prototypes or experiment without much worrying about the dependencies of the algorithms or conflict in the local os. I started using docker for my PhD experiments recently and it is extremely useful once it’s set up, we can run it anywhere where docker supports. This is really useful if we want to try someone’s code if they provide docker containers.Majority of my work in the Robotic Operating System(ROS) and one of the main tool I am using is the standard 3D visualization tool called Rviz. The main challenge here is docker containers doesn’t come up with UI. This poses difficulty in running the GUI application in docker containers. This indeed a challenge in running rviz on docker.Technically, XServer is essential for GUI application to run and the default XServer application in the Linux environment is not available in the docker containers[1]. Basically, we need to share the host’s XServer with the Container using volume argument -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix and the host’s display environment variable --env=DISPLAY . It can be done using the docker run command.For the experiment, we create two docker containers. One is for running roscore which is a ROS master and the second one is our rviz container. The docker run command for rviz is based in [3] and I am extremely thankful for his Github repo[3].We are going to use the same Dockerfile for both containers. Download the Dockerfile from the link here and save it as Dockerfile.To create the first container image, run below command on the same directory as the above file saved(It will take a few minutes to complete):docker build -t roscore_c .Run below command to create the second container image that is going to be the rviz container:docker build -t rviz_c .First, we need to run the ROS master. In order to do that, we run and ssh into the first container ‘roscore_c’.docker run -it — rm — privileged — net=host roscore_c /bin/bashWe are now in docker container, run roscoreNow, we need to run and ssh into rviz docker that need bit more arguments as we discussed earlier. Follow below commands to display rviz that runs on the docker on a separate terminal window.xhost +local:dockerdocker run -it — rm — privileged — net=host — env=NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all — env=NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=all — env=DISPLAY — env=QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1 -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix — runtime=nvidia -e NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 rviz_c /bin/bashIf you are running the latest docker, then no need to pass the Nvidia as runtime as shown above. Code for that version is below:docker run -it — rm — privileged — net=host — env=NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all — env=NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=all — env=DISPLAY — env=QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1 -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix — gpus 2 rviz_c /bin/bashWe are now in the rviz docker container and run rviz. You can see that rviz window is opened up. Yay :)Here is the video of the example shown above:The code can be found here.If you like my write up, follow me on Github, Linkedin, and/or Medium profile.Reference:https://medium.com/@SaravSun/running-gui-applications-inside-docker-containers-83d65c0db110http://docs.ros.org/kinetic/api/moveit_tutorials/html/doc/quickstart_in_rviz/quickstart_in_rviz_tutorial.htmlhttps://github.com/koenlek/docker_ros_nvidiaWritten byDhanoop KarunakaranRobotics PhD candidate@USYD, Software Engineer, Self Driving cars nanodegree holder@ UdacityFollow10 10 10 RoboticsSoftware DevelopmentArtificial IntelligenceMore from Intro to Artificial IntelligenceFollowLet's learn AI togetherRead more from Intro to Artificial IntelligenceMore From MediumMerging Meeting TimesAbrar Shariar in The StartupRoutes in RailsJennifer Oh in The StartupIs a Chromebook Good for Coding and Data Science?Matt Gosden in The StartupPing Power — ICMP TunnelNir Chako in InfoSec Write-upsA New Graduate Software Developer’s Journey — Unit TestingYusuf Cemal Çelebi in ÇSTechTransitioning to Go pt.2Ivor Scott in The StartupSetting up a Private Password Vault in 5 Minutes with DockerJulian Runnels in The StartupWhat Is Inheritance and Composition in Java?

Is AI Possible?,https://medium.com/@kcalizadeh/is-ai-possible-180e0eb2d1dc?source=tag_archive---------2-----------------------,"Philosophy,Robotics,Artificial Intelligence,Consciousness,Metaphysics","Alternative Philosophical Perspectives on the Possibility of Conscious MachinesPhoto by Franck V. on UnsplashMany people take it for granted that humanity could one day create conscious, thinking machines. This kind of Artificial Intelligence has been explored in media since the dawn of science fiction (think I, Robot or Terminator). Let’s be clear though — we’re not talking here about the baby AI that lets your smartphone send you invasive ads. This is something more: a fully aware being created artificially from non-biological components, a robot that can fall in love, that can feel pain, that has its own hopes and dreams.But, as with many things that people take for granted, the idea that such a thing could be created involves a number of serious philosophical commitments. If we are to create consciousness out of metal and wires, then we have to accept that consciousness can be created out of metal and wires. This often means accepting a certain view about ourselves as well; namely, that our own consciousness is merely the product of physical operations (presumably in our brains), and can’t be attributed to anything non-physical like a soul or a spirit. Indeed, if you are religious, the entire idea of AI in this strong sense should strike you as deeply implausible and problematic — maybe we can create a machine that acts like a person, but can we really create a soul in a lab? Probably not.The idea that consciousness can arise out of purely material components like brains or wires is part of a larger philosophical worldview called materialism. According to that view, the most basic elements of the world are all material things. It follows then that consciousness must somehow be constructed on a purely material foundation. That might sound about right to you, but materialism is just one viewpoint among many.Is this all there really is in the universe? Maybe. Photo by Lucas Lenzi on UnsplashThe fundamental question here is “is the world physical or nonphysical?” Materialism says it is all basically physical. For my part, I’m not going to say much here about whether or not materialism is true or not. There are a lot of questions that materialism has a hard time answering, but then that’s true of most philosophical positions. Instead, I’m going to explore some of the other answers to this fundamental question. Materialism says it’s all physical. Most religions, by contrast, are dualistic. That is, they say that the world is partly physical and partly nonphysical; there are rocks and trees but also souls and god(s). These two positions are relatively well-understood. But there are two other positions that are less common. Idealism, for example, says the world is entirely nonphysical. And there is even a position that says that it’s actually something else that is at the bottom of both the physical and non-physical parts of the world.Beautiful, but maybe just all in your head. Photo by zhengtao tang on UnsplashLet’s take idealism first. Have you ever wondered what things are like when you’re not looking? According to idealism, when no one is looking, there is literally just nothing there. Or, to be more precise, there is nothing to what a thing is aside from our perceptions of it. This idea may sound kind of insane, but it actually makes a lot of sense. Imagine a fish, for example. Now take away the smell of it, the sight of it, the sound of it, the touch of it, the taste of it… what’s left? Nothing. If you take all the sensory elements out of it, the word ‘fish’ is just an empty sound, signifying nothing. Follow this train of thought to its conclusion and you realize that when we talk about material objects, we are really just talking about sets of commonly associated perceptions. The word ‘fish’ is just a convenient shorthand for a certain pattern of smells, sights, and sounds. And in fact, for an idealist the word ‘material’ itself just denotes the fact that certain perceptions are ones that everyone else can also have (where ‘mental’ denotes more private perceptions — hence why hallucinations are called mental).In this way, idealism is essentially showing how what we take to be the material world is really a purely perceptual, immaterial, universe. This doesn’t mean that there is no such thing as rocks or trees, but it does mean that rocks and trees don’t have any existence independent of perception. In other words, if all the perceivers in the world died, the rocks and trees would go with them.Now then, what would an idealist say about AI? Simply put, an idealist would find the entire idea of AI laughable. To them, consciousness is the basis of all existence; nothing exists that is not at least a possible object for consciousness. How then could consciousness itself be based on those objects? This would be like saying first that a foundation supports a building and then turning around and saying that well, the building also supports the foundation. For an idealist, trying to create AI is an exercise in self-deception and futility. We could create something that acts human, but it could never have the capacity for consciousness. You can fall in love with a robot because you have consciousness, but a robot can never fall in love with you — after all, the robot is just a pattern of perceptions with no inner life to speak of.So that’s idealism. Idealism in this philosophical sense has mostly fallen out of fashion in the western world, but there were periods of history where it was the dominant viewpoint. Idealism can count among its adherents such influential figures as Berkeley and Kant, and that’s only the idealists in the western philosophical tradition. In the east, Buddhism and Hinduism are both popular religions that take the entire material world to be merely illusory, a mental projection like a dream, based on delusions and past sins. So while idealism may not feel natural to a scientifically-oriented person raised in the US, it is by no means a position to be dismissed out of hand.This is the face of man who sees everything as logical. Photo of G. W. F. Hegel, Public DomainWe turn now to a fourth position. This position says that the world is neither fundamentally material nor fundamentally immaterial. Instead, it posits something else, a third kind of thing, and tries to show how both physicality and consciousness can develop out of it. There are a few different versions of this perspective, but here I’ll be presenting one that is sometimes called panlogicism. Panlogicism, often attributed to the philosopher G. W. F. Hegel, is the view that all things (‘pan’) are fundamentally logical in nature (‘logicism’).Ok, well that probably sounds like a bunch of gibberish. Let’s take a second to see what this could actually mean. Have you ever used logic to think about the world? Maybe you’ve thought something like “if I jump in the pool, I’ll get wet” or even just something as basic as “that chair is blue.” Now here’s a question that might blow your mind: why do you think that the logical rules you use to think should actually line up with how the world is organized? Why should the world be set up to suit your ‘if-then’ statements? Why should the world be divided up into things with properties that do stuff just like our language is divided up into nouns and adjectives and verbs? Is it all just a happy coincidence?This question is an important one and there are, as I’m sure you’ve guessed by now, a few different answers. Idealists could say logic and the world line up because the laws of thought (logic) are projected onto objects as we collect experiences and label them. Materialists could say that the world has these structures already and then our language and thought evolved to match them because not matching was maladaptive.But panlogicists say otherwise. For them, these logical structures aren’t static organizational devices we just apply when we think. Instead, they are independent organizing principles of the universe, dynamically evolving and changing, albeit not in space and time. Just as a train of thought leads logically from one idea to the next, logic itself leads from one concept to another. At some point the “concept” of a material world is generated and boom! that’s how the material world comes to exist. A similar story of conceptual development can be told about how consciousness came about. The details of these are quite complicated, but the bottom line is that this purely logical development leads to both the material and the immaterial universes. In this way, logic is said to be the fundamental structure of the world.What bearing does this have on AI? Well, like an idealist, the panlogicist would be a bit wary of AI. After all, they don’t really believe that the right assemblage of material components can lead to consciousness. That said, it is possible that AI could come about in the course of the world’s logical development. And that logical development is manifested (in part) through the actions of human beings, so maybe our attempts to create AI out of metal and wires is actually part of that logical development. But if we do create AI, it won’t really be because of some physical laws governing consciousness; it will be because AI is part of the conceptual progression of reality.So there you have it. It turns out that there are a lot of ways to think about what reality really is, and depending how you think about it, you’ll have quite different ideas about whether AI is really possible. If you’re a materialist, you’ll just be looking to assemble the right material components in the right order. If you’re a dualist like most religious people, you’ll probably dismiss the idea out of hand — it’s souls that think and feel, and we can’t create those, so we can’t create a machine that thinks or feels. At best we could create something that does a perfect impression of humanity while still being hollow inside. If you’re an idealist, you’ll also throw out the idea of AI, since building consciousness out of the material world would be about as likely as building an egg out of omelettes. Last, if you’re a panlogicist (which you probably aren’t, let’s be real), you’ll accept the possibility of AI, but not on the basis of the physical sciences, but rather on the basis of the logical development of reality.Did Wall-E and E.V.E. actually fall in love? Are they even capable of love? Photo by Lenin Estrada on UnsplashAll these positions have any number of additional details and considerations; whole books have been written on a single argument for one of these positions. But while this article may not have gone into great detail on them, I hope it has given you at least a taste of each. Hopefully, the next time you see someone fall in love with a robot in a movie you can take a step back and think about what’s really going on there; is their love a self-indulgent fantasy or does the robot really love them back?Written byKourosh AlizadehKourosh Alizadeh is a data scientist, author and philosopher.

The simulations were part of DARPA’s AlphaDogFight challenge. Frighteningly, “Banger” the human pilot could not hit Heron the AI’s F-16 fighter jet.“Heron displayed superhuman capabilities of being able to shoot and aim accurately while performing highly dynamic maneuvers,” in an F-16, Towards Data Science claims. Moreover, could outwit all of Banger’s strategies.Importantly, the AI had complete data about the dog fight; an unrealistic scenario. However, the AI could adapt to Banger’s changing strategies. The AlphaDogFight challenge is DARPA’s effort to develop artificial intelligence capable of operating fighter planes.The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is holding the challenge with the US Air Force’s Air Weapons School, a press release states. Heron bested both human pilots and AIs from seven other companies in five rounds to win the AlphaDogFight challenge.DARPA is the US military’s research and development organization.

But now Mark Miskin of the University of Pennsylvania has developed a consignment of many solar-powered microscope robots.To do this, they need developed a fresh actuator made from a really thin layer of platinum metal. Earlier, it had been impossible to form micrometer scale actuators. When these thin actuators turn, the straightforward robot moves forward.The solar cells on the rear of the square robot deliver energy thereto . The robot moves slowly in response to the beam, which may even be seen within the video. Mark says you’ll rotate the robot wherever you would like. These robots are built using exact circuit card designing technology and within the first phase, a million robots are developed.Each of those robots is adequate to one-tenth of a millimeter and has got to be viewed under a microscope. At the instant, these robots only move in one direction, but consistent with Mark, within the next phase, an equivalent robots are going to be fitted with a spread of sensors which will be ready to do various things. they’re going to then be controlled for specific tasks through programming.Now let’s mention their practical aspects, they will be utilized in the physical body for medical purposes.

Inverse Kinematics,https://medium.com/@sedsvit/inverse-kinematics-4738dc18327e?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Inverse Kinematics,Kinematics,Robotics,Mechanics,Space Technology","IntroductionThe first thing that comes to anyone’s mind when they read the words “Inverse Kinematics” is probably nothing, at least that was once the case for me. In January 2020, at the start of the year of doom, I found myself in a new environment of a project team, SEDS VIT Projects. I was recruited as part of the CS team. I couldn’t help but wonder as to, in what all possible ways this particular domain would be useful in making a Rover work, and that excitement was overwhelming. Soon enough, I was assigned my task, which revolved around a very critical part of the rover, the robotic arm. The two words which this article is about, this was the first time I had heard them.What is Inverse Kinematics?Now, before you should know what inverse kinematics is, you must know, what forward kinematics is.Imagine you’re chilling on your couch and suddenly, you feel thirsty; so you want to pick up the bottle of water sitting on the table next to the couch. You will just move your hand in a way that your fingers grab the bottle and then pick it up. The rest of your arm, including your elbow and shoulder, will move according to that. This natural movement of the arm is what everyone applies individually, but when it comes to a robotic arm, implementing this is much more difficult.Now, imagine a world in which we move our arm based on the principles of forward kinematics. Imagine the same scenario again, but this time you can’t move your entire arm at once. This time, you have to proceed “forward”, to say literally, starting from your shoulder. You are allowed to move/ rotate your shoulder while keeping the rest of the arm fixed until the arm is in line with the bottle of water. Now, going “forward”, we move the elbow while keeping the rest of the arm fixed so that it is in line with the bottle of water. Finally, we move our wrist by either bending or rotating and finally grab the bottle of water. Comparing the time the two techniques took after experimentation, forward kinematics took 3 seconds while inverse kinematics took a single second.For a better understanding, you may see the 2 GIFs below.So far, we have established one thing- Inverse Kinematics is efficient.Now let’s drop layman for a while and talk robotics. Imagine a three-segment robotic arm; segment 1 being the shoulder till the elbow, 2nd segment is the elbow till the wrist, and segment 3, the wrist till the end effector/ gripper. Forward kinematics means predicting the coordinates of the gripper based on the input, which is the joint angles, the length of each segment, and the coordinate of each joint. The otherwise referred to as ball and socket and synovial joints are motors in this case. When it comes to inverse kinematics, we do the inverse of this. We take the coordinates of the gripper and accordingly calculate the joint angles, as we discussed in the functioning of a human arm, in the example above. So, how do we do it? How do we teach our robotic arm, the mechanics, which we as infants took quite a while to pick up? The right answer lies in geometry, in the form of trigonometry. Given below is the mathematical interpretation of what we’ve discussed above with some pictorial justification.For a better understanding of what a robotic arm looks like, use the image below for reference:Mathematical JustificationFigure 1 (Top View)In figure 1, consider (x, y) as the coordinates of the object you want to grab. The edge of the base of your robotic arm is from where we start considering our workspace. Δy represents the distance from the base of your arm to the edge of the base. The ∠θ’ is the angle required to rotate first so that the arm is in line with the object. It is known as the rotatory function of the ball and socket joint.Figure 2 (Side View)In our system, the lengths of the segments of the arm must be equal. Since they are equal, the isosceles triangle rule suggests that the base angles be equal as well. Inferring from these two premises, we come to the mathematical conclusion which helps us compute the angles at which the segments should be, with each other.Now you might be wondering how are we going to determine the coordinate system. The answer is OpenCV. You might use a camera to capture an image and take the image as an input for your code, and the output will be your image in a 2-D coordinate system. A feasible alternative is Kinect, where you can get the idea about the depth as well and accordingly create a 3-D coordinate system to upscale your project further.Where we use itWe use it in the robotic arm of our rover. The base here becomes the base of your rover, and a turntable performs the rotatory function. Using Inverse Kinematics, we perform dexterous tasks such as picking up an object, rotating a knob, turning a switch on/off and typing on a keyboard as well. The interfacing between fetching values from IoT sensors, computing, and passing instructions to rotate the motor, is made possible through ROS, which is where CS comes into play.Inverse Kinematics is applicable in various fields involving robotics. You can perform a lot of DIY projects with your ideas, ranging from something as simple as a robotic arm typewriter to something much more complex like a robotic arm that feeds you. Different use cases will require various levels of implementation of what we discussed.Written bySEDS-VITThe official blog of SEDS VIT, Indian headquarters of the global NPO, Students for the Exploration and Development of Space.Follow551 551 551 Inverse KinematicsKinematicsRoboticsMechanicsSpace TechnologyMore from SEDS-VITFollowThe official blog of SEDS VIT, Indian headquarters of the global NPO, Students for the Exploration and Development of Space.More From MediumAlternative Way to Perform OR Query in Cloud FirestoreMendhie Emmanuel in The StartupPandas CheatsheetAmandeep Singh in The StartupCassandra TTL intricacies and usage by examplesRahul KumarParse Args in Bash ScriptsMarco Massenzio in Python In Plain EnglishWriting an Image Manipulation Library in Go — Part 1Koray Göçmen in The Startupaugmented-ui — Cyberpunk-Inspired Web UI Made EasyIndrek Lasn in Better ProgrammingRunning end-to-end tests with GitHub ActionsWarren Day in tomorrowappCommand Line Applications + Python Click + NewsApiElizabeth NakijjoAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Navigation System- Build Vs Buy,https://medium.com/@puru_84317/robot-navigation-system-build-vs-buy-4a90ea8f2dfd?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Robotics,Artificial Intelligence,Self Driving Cars,Automation,Machine Learning","Icon from FreepikIf you are building an Autonomous Mobile Robot, it is quite likely that you will need a navigation system. Off the shelf, navigation comes in two flavors. More on that here. In this article, I am looking at another choice that needs to be made — build vs buy.Navigation is a hard problem. Often, start-ups in robotics underestimate the effort involved in building a navigation system that is reliable and precise. Many start-ups try to tweak open-source software to meet their navigation needs. But these do not always cut it. Mowito has hours of navigation data from robots on the field. This data helps us rigorously test and fine-tune the performance of our software for various operating environments.So, why should a bot maker build a navigation stack of his own? We spoke to a few companies and here are some of the reasons we heard:I would like to own the IP for navigationI thought it was simple to build itI had vision engineers who doubled up as navigation engineersIt is a critical piece of the stack. Would prefer to have total control over itI never knew the existence of off-the-shelf solutionsWe urge you to ask these questions before embarking on a mission to build your own navigation stack:1) Do I have the expertise to build “the best” navigation software?Building navigation software requires learning and rigor. It needs engineers with a specific skill set to predict possible pitfalls and edge cases. While it can be argued that any software engineer can program navigation, there is always a learning curve. And, a ton of data and testing is needed to get it right.2) Will I be able to launch sooner if I go with off-the-shelf navigation?It might take many months to build the right navigation stack for your bot. As per our survey, teams have taken as much as 10 months to get the basic deployable navigation system ready. Off the shelf, navigation saves you the time and helps you launch your bot sooner.3) Will I be able to manage project finances better if I buy off the shelf navigation?Months of engineering time saved translate to lower build cost and improved runway. When you decide to go with Mowito’s stack, you also get Mowito’s exemplary support. That means happy customers and more dollars saved.4) What is the focus of my bot/business?By this, we mean, are you building a bot to target weeds, clean carpets or pluck strawberries?.If you are making a robot to target weeds in the farm, your core IP will lie in the technology you build to precisely recognize the weeds, locate them and take them out. The same idea can be extended to other specialized tasks. You can pursue those goals while you leave the navigation to us.At Mowito, engineers work tirelessly to build the best navigation stack for your robot. With Mowito’s best in class trajectory planner, your robot zooms around obstacles without a pause in motion.

Pour cela, les équipes de Brain Navi ont repris et adapté leur technologie principale (un bras robotisé qui aide à préparer les patients à la chirurgie du cerveau), puis ont mené des tests expérimentaux sur leurs employés (volontaires !).Le robot “Brain Navi Nasal Swab” scanne tout d’abord le visage du patient avec une caméra de détection, afin de mesurer la profondeur de sa cavité nasale.

Types of Artificial Intelligence,https://medium.com/@salmanmaken57/types-of-artificial-intelligence-3f4ee103a4c7?source=tag_archive---------4-----------------------,"AI,Artificial Intelligence,Robotics,Machine,Computers","Artificial Intelligence(AI) can be defined as the ability of a computer to perform tasks commonly associated with human beings. Scientists have divided AI into three categories:1. Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)Artificial Narrow Intelligence , also known as “Weak AI”, is referred to as an AI that has the ability to do one task at a time. It is not able to do more than one task at a time. ANI does not do tasks on their own but rely on human interference.Everything that you see in the form of AI today is ANI, like playing chess or Facebook news feed.2. Artificial General Intelligence(AGI)Artificial General Intelligence, also known as “Strong AI”, is a type of AI that can do tasks on its own and they have the ability to make mistakes and learn from their own mistakes. It has the ability to learn quickly and solve complex problems in less time.Strong AI does not currently exist. Scientists are working to develop this level of AI and predicted that we will see AGI in the near future.3. Artificial Superintelligence(ASI)Artificial Super Intelligence is the AI that will surpass human intelligence. Scientists predict that it will have the ability to become trillions of times faster and more intelligent than human beings. Stephen Hawking said about AI that it could be the:“Worst event in the history of our civilization.”Nick Bostrom defines superintelligence as:“An intellect that is much smarter than the best human brains in practically every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom, and social skills.”Scientists predict that it might take over humans and result in human extinction. So we should be super careful with Artificial Superintelligence.Written bySalman MakenReader and WriterFollowAIArtificial IntelligenceRoboticsMachineComputersMore from Salman MakenFollowReader and WriterMore From MediumThe Fundamental Theories Behind Artificial IntelligenceBryn Bennett in Better ProgrammingHow Neuroscience and AI Play Politics with our BrainsDr. Adam Hart in Towards AINever Worry about AI Again — There Will Be a Job for You in the FutureAI JobsTinder + AI: A Perfect Matchmaking?Daksh Trehan in Towards AITop 5 Insights After I Spent 100 Days Learning About Artificial IntelligenceJamie Beach in The StartupWhat Are the Odds You’ll Lose Your Job to a Robot?Elizabeth Blessing in Making of a MillionaireMeasure Chatbot Customer Effort Using Disambiguation & Auto LearningCobus GreylingThe Awe of Artificial IntelligenceTannya D.

AI-powered craft to navigate through asteroids in space — A Kalman filter application,https://medium.com/@vikbehal/ai-powered-craft-to-navigate-through-asteroids-in-space-a-kalman-filter-application-2296231fcf03?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Artificial Intelligence,Bayes Theorem,Robotics","Let us imagine a craft in the space where hundreds of moving asteroids are around it. Your goal is to design an algorithm that will enable the craft to reach at the top of this space by avoiding collision with asteroids or space boundary.Visualizing the space and possible solutionThe initial position of the craft in spaceThe AI-powered craft should be able to navigate given space to reach the goal — the top green area of the this spaceThe navigation and final stage of the craftThinking about a possible solutionImagine you had a way of predicting where asteroids could be in future. Consequently, you can easily move to one of the available positions where asteroids may not move to in future. Additionally, you would like that position to be near the goal — towards the top of the given space in this example.In Artificial Intelligence, one possible way of predicting these future locations could be done using Kalman filters.Kalman filters are ideal for systems which are continuously changing — as asteroids are moving in this example. They have the advantage that they are light on memory (they don’t need to keep any history other than the previous state), and they are very fast, making them well suited for real-time problems and embedded systems.How does Kalman filter works?In simple terms, the Kalman filter is a 2 step process — Measurement and Predict.Measurement — We observe data through different means. E.g. In Self-driving car, it could be the data recorded through Laser and Sensors. In our example, this could be pictures of asteroids at different time steps.Predict — Given measurement and data about the previous timestep, one could predict future location.Behind the scene, every intelligent system is a set of mathematical equations. In our case measurement is done using Bayes theorem and predict using Total probability.Practically, It is near impossible to get measurements which are 100% accurate — noise in measurements, delay in processing data, etc. could lead to these inaccuracies. Thus Kalman filter uses an iterative process, which calls measurement and predicts steps multiple times. Eventually, we expect our system to start getting better in predicting the future location of asteroids.Solving given problem using Kalman filtersIn our problem set the craft can either move left, right or keep going forward. In terms of acceleration, it can either increase, decrease or remains the same. This gives us 9 possible moves in spaceUsing Kalman filter, we predict future locations of all asteroids 1 timestep aheadTo ensure our craft does not crash with asteroids, we keep a minimum distance from them. Using this safe distance, we find safe positions where we don’t expect asteroids to be in future — 1 timestep ahead. If we have multiple safe positions, choose one which is near to our goal — top green areaIf there is no safe position, choose a position which is most safe among all positions — distance to the nearest asteroid is maximumIteratively follow steps 1–4 and keep moving forward until we reach the goalFailuresCrashing into asteroidMoving in a the wrong directionAll of these failures requires fine-tuning parameters, which allows the craft to choose a different path, either at the beginning or while deciding where to move nextHere is another example of successful navigationIf you are interested in learning more about Kalman filters, below two are excellent resources.Artificial Intelligence for Robotics | UdacityLearn how to program all the major systems of a robotic car from the leader of Google and Stanford's autonomous driving…www.udacity.comWritten byVikrant BehalFood, Technology, Culture, and humansFollow30 30 30 Artificial IntelligenceBayes TheoremRoboticsMore from Vikrant BehalFollowFood, Technology, Culture, and humansMore From MediumMLOPS, Integrating ML with DevOpsSaurabh Agarwal in AI In Plain EnglishImage Captioning using Attention MechanismSubham Sarkar in The StartupSolaris Model Deployment: From Start to FinishRoshan Ram in The DownLinQClassifying Nationalities Using NamesAsha Vishwanathan in The StartupFundamentals of Machine Learning Model EvaluationAlexander Parunov in HeyJobs TechConversion of RGB images to Hyperspectral using Deep learningRishabh Karmakar in Analytics VidhyaDumbly Teaching a Dumb Robot Poker Hands (For Dummies or Smarties!)Jon Solow in The StartupExplicit Recommender System: Matrix Factorization in PyTorchRina BuoyAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
JetRVR AI Robot — Part 1,https://medium.com/robopunk/jetrvr-52c6042de3e4?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Robots,Robotics,AI,Artificial Intelligence,Nvidia","AI powered Robot made with the Jetson Nano and Sphero RVRNvidia introduced the Jetson Nano in 2019, an affordable single board computer made for AI processing which became immensely popular. Alongside the Nano, they released the Jetbot kit, an open source robot design for autonomous driving projects. Jetbot was an easy way for enthusiasts to experiment with computer vision and machine learning models at home or in their labs.At around the same time, Sphero also released the RVR on the back of a successful Kickstarter campaign. The RVR is a mini programmable robotic rover, made to be extensible by allowing hackers to add additional hardware and even connect up micro controllers and mini computers.While the Jetbot kit does the job, the idea of imbuing the RVR with AI capabilities sounded like an exciting project. Hence was born the JetRVR — a project which aimed to combine the smarts of the Nano and the tank like driving capabilities of the RVR.Check out the latest JetRVR updates on RobopunkA Perfect MatchJetson NanoNvidia Jetson NanoAI Performance: 472 GFLOPSGPU: 128 Core GPUCPU: Quad-Core ARM® Cortex®-A57 MPCoreNano sized (100mm x 80mm)Sphero RVRSphero RVRSensors: 9 Axis IMU / IRCommunication: BluetoothBattery Life: Approx 2 hoursTorque: More than enough!Why the RVR?The best thing about this combination is that there is no need to tinker with the hardware. Its a no-solder project. The RVR works well out of the box and drives beautifully. Although there is no official software support for the Nano, Sphero has a Python SDK for the Raspberry Pi which can be used for our purpose. Curiously the RVR does not come with built in WIFI. In order to drive it past the bluetooth range of ~10ft, it’s almost essential that it is paired with a controller like the Nano.The RVR is a very capable mobile chassis. Sphero’s engineers have put a good amount of time into ensuring the drive mechanics work well, saving you the hassle of building your own. A comment has to be made about the RVR’s design. It’s beautifully put together and blows other Jetbots away in the aesthetics department. It actually looks like a robot instead of a motherboard on wheels.Why the Jetson Nano?The Jetson Nano is a favourite amongst enthusiasts for a couple of reasons. 1) It’s affordable and possibly the cheapest option for an all in one single board GPU computer with AI processing capabilities. 2) The Nano’s small size makes it perfect for embedded projects. In our case, the Nano sits perfectly on top of the RVR. 3) It has more than enough power for our AI processing needs, being able to handle multiple concurrent video streams.In Part 2 of the series, we will look at setting up the Jetson Nano and RVR for our JetRVR project.We hope you found this article useful.

Energy Robotics announces pilot with Merck and US-Based Boston Dynamics,https://medium.com/frankfurtvalley/energy-robotics-announces-pilot-with-merck-and-us-based-boston-dynamics-bb5ec7906272?source=tag_archive---------2-----------------------,"Mobility,Darmstadt,Merck,Robotics","Energy Robotics, a leading developer of software solutions for mobile robots used in industrial applications, announced last week that its remote sensing and inspection solution for Boston Dynamics’s agile mobile robot Spot was successfully deployed at Merck’s thermal exhaust treatment plant at its headquarters in Darmstadt, Germany. Energy Robotics equipped Spot with sensor technology and remote supervision functions to support the inspection mission.Thermal exhaust treatment facilities play an important role in environmental protection. They contain a number of maintenance intensive components that must be monitored frequently. Sensors typically held by a human doing routine inspection are used to detect anomalies in equipment such as pumps or fans, as well as inspect pressure and fluid levels in tanks. Energy Robotics integrated these sensors with Spot to make condition monitoring more efficient. With sensors like thermal and zoom cameras Spot gathered data that was transferred by encrypted communication over the public 4G network to the operator’s web-based interface on PC or tablet.By automating a path through their facility, Merck and Energy Robotics achieved a smooth and successful mission totaling one hour for a course through a multi-story facility, with the robot negotiating multiple industrial stairs. At scale, such robotic inspections can increase the frequency and consistency of facility performance monitoring. Using a larger, more diverse data set automatically collected by robots could significantly improve long-term efficiency by predictive maintenance. This type of scaled equipment monitoring would also make environmental protection efforts more effective.Spot Robot from Boston Dynamics with Energy Robotics autonomy software and sensor solution at Merck’s thermal exhaust treatment plant.This type of routine monitoring is important, but dull and uncomfortable. Spot helps to perform physically demanding tasks in confined, hot and noisy spaces. The robot also provides routine maintenance and asset performance data in a reproducible, high quality manner.What appears to be easy and efficient, is the result of enormous worldwide progress in both robotic software and hardware development over the last years.“Merck is one of the first companies in Europe testing Spot. The pilot with our new partners Energy Robotics and Boston Dynamics shows the state of the art in autonomous robotics,” says Hartmut Manske, Head of Automation and Robotics at Merck. “We are convinced that robots like Spot can efficiently and reliably support remotely supervised missions at our plants.”Pilot insights: Proving the value of robotic hardware and softwareCombining Boston Dynamics’ intuitive controls, robotic intelligence and open interface with Energy Robotics’ control and autonomy software, user interface and encrypted cloud connection, Spot can be taught to autonomously perform a specific inspection round while being supervised remotely from anywhere with internet connectivity. Multiple cameras and industrial sensors enable the robot to find its way around while recording and transmitting information about the facility’s onsite equipment operations.Spot reads the displays of gauges in its immediate vicinity and can also zoom in on distant objects using an externally-mounted optical zoom lens. In the thermal exhaust treatment facility, for instance, it monitors cooling water levels and notes whether condensation water has accumulated. Outside the facility, Spot monitors pipe bridges for anomalies.Among the robot’s many abilities, it can detect defects of wires or the temperature of pump components using thermal imaging. The robot was put through its paces on a comprehensive course that tested its ability to handle special challenges such as climbing stairs, scaling embankments and walking over grating. To avoid collisions, Spot is able to circumvent vehicles and other obstacles.“With Spot, Boston Dynamics provides a robot with outstanding mobility for innovative industrial applications. Spot perfectly complements our comprehensive software stack for autonomous inspection, navigation and fleet management,” says Dr. Stefan Kohlbrecher, CTO of Energy Robotics.“Together with Merck, we are looking forward to expanding Spot’s use cases, especially for challenging indoor and outdoor areas, such as autonomous inspection of a wastewater treatment plant. With such deployments we create tangible business value for our customers.” adds Dr. Dorian Scholz, CEO of Energy Robotics.Three partners, one goalMichael Perry, Vice President of Business Development from US-based company Boston Dynamics is confident: “Energy Robotics has significant experience around autonomous mobile robot control and sensor integrations in complex environments. We are looking forward to cooperating with them in the future as a strong partner to serve our industrial customers.”Autonomous robots are gaining traction in several industries. Energy Robotics’ software for autonomous robotic inspection and fleet supervision, which is already a leading solution in the oil and gas industry, is now available with Boston Dynamics’ Spot, the leading solution in mobile robotics for rugged environments. Customers like Merck benefit from this powerful combination, which allows to generate and analyze large volumes of sensor data increasing operational efficiency, reducing maintenance costs, and improving people’s working conditions.See more here:FrankfurtValleyFrankfurt ValleyFollowMobilityDarmstadtMerckRoboticsWritten byPedro Gonçalo FerreiraFollowEditor in chief of FRANKFURT VALLEYFollowFrankfurtValleyFollowFrankfurt ValleyFollowWritten byPedro Gonçalo FerreiraFollowEditor in chief of FRANKFURT VALLEYFrankfurtValleyFollowFrankfurt ValleyMore From MediumTesla’s Cybertruck Is Trying to Tell Us SomethingJ.

Telegram Bot For Automation OF Light,https://medium.com/@cheelamanthulakeerthana/telegram-bot-for-automation-of-light-2ece31cee7d7?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"IoT,Robotics,Telegram Bot,Telegram,Automation","“Technology,Like Art, is a soaring exercise of human imagination”, said Daniel bell. Smart home, robots, drones, artifical intelligence…. isn’t everything sounding fictional? Well, now this our new common, new routine.This is my 1st project and 1st blog. I worked on a telegram bot which can turn on and off the light from anywhere in the world. With a single command of /On, the light turns on and with a single command /Off, the light turns off. It’s human tendency to forget things. We generally forget to switch off the lights when we are leaving the room. But, Electrical energy is precious. It will be a huge mistake to waste it. Using simple concepts of IOT, we can turn on and off the light in a smarter way. Who doesn’t love smart things? Smart phones, Smart home, Smart vehicle and so on. We crave for smart technology. Amidst the pandemic, I couldn’t design a physical working model of it, but I used Adafruit as my platform. Now, let us look into my project.I primarily used 3 platforms to work on the project. And those are Google colaboratory, Adafruit, Telegram API. Look into the picture I shared down.The platform you can see here is Adafruit. Adafruit is a platform where I put my imaginary smart light indicator. I named the project as telegram bot. In that I created a feed called bot in it and inserted a light indicator. Such that when the value 0 is given to the cloud, the light turns off, and when the value 1 is given to the cloud, the light turn on. So now, How are we going to upload the values to cloud? It’s basic IOT. To understand it, go through the code below. I used google colab and created a code for project. The language i used is Python.The most common doubt raised after seeing the code is, What is BOT_API and how do you get it? To answer your question, while working on clouds everything is adressed using API keys. In this project, BOT_API is my robot address. To get your’s, go to telegram and search for bot father, using basic commands create a bot and you will get the BOT_API there. I got my API, now I’m going to command my bot to turn on the light using /On command and turn off the light using /Off command. My bot replies, Turning on and Turning Off and then it turns on and off the light in adafruit platform.So now, You can make you own telegram bot.

Robotic Surgeries,https://medium.com/@tanveerinamdar/robotic-surgeries-32a79fec7b0b?source=tag_archive---------4-----------------------,"Robotics,Healthcare,Surgery","Source: Ortho FeedRobotic Surgery makes use of a robotic surgical system to perform operations on patients solely or alongside surgeons depending on the situation. Robotic surgery is minimally invasive. There is less trauma, pain, and recovery time for patients who undergo robotic surgery. It is perfect for complex procedures that need a high amount of accuracy. Surgeons can thoroughly examine the area that is being operated on to precisely conduct the operation with a clearer view and steady hands. Read on to find out how robotic surgeries are revolutionizing healthcare.The Da Vinci SystemThe Da Vinci System is the most commonly used robotic system all over the world. It consists of a three-dimensional stereoscopic monitor with three robotic arms that allow for the surgeon’s movements to be exactly replicated. Surgeries can be performed in real-time by the compact electromechanical arms and apparatus inserted in the patient’s body through tiny, minimally invasive cuts. The robotic instruments offer better dexterity and range of motion, thus allowing the surgeon to perform delicate surgeries in difficult places like retinas, prostate removals, and hysterectomies.Radiology with Robotic PrecisionSource: BritannicaThe CyberKnife System destroys cancer tumors while minimizing damage to nearby healthy tissue. This can potentially help reduce side effects and provide patients with better treatment outcomes. The robotic precision also tracks the tumor during treatment, makes sure the tumor is getting the required dosage over shorter treatment sessions, with minimal risk to healthy tissue and surrounding organs. This is a game-changing experience for patients as it is done with less incision and the recovery time is sped up.Eye-tracking camera controlSurgical robots can also move using an eye-tracking camera control. Surgeons can move the camera just by moving their eyes. They simultaneously provide haptic feedback so surgeons can feel the forces that the robotics arms encounter. This is beneficial when working in delicate areas, such as the eyes where surgeons need extremely steady hands to remove blood underneath the retina due to age-related macular degeneration or membranes from patients’ eyes.Minimally Invasive, Scar Free ProceduresSource: WRVOCardiovascular SurgeriesCardiovascular surgeries are all about accuracy and steady hands. Minimally invasive robotic surgery helps treat heart conditions like coronary artery disease, an atrial septal defect, and problematic heart valve conditions. Robotic cardiovascular surgery is performed through small incisions between the ribs. It is generally preferred as traditional heart surgery requires the splitting of the breastbone, this leads to higher blood loss, pain, and longer recovery time.Transoral SurgeryTransoral robotic surgery, also known as the head and neck surgery is performed on the throat, tongue, tonsils, and the soft palate to treat cancer. The small robotic device arms and cameras allow surgeons to get a clearer view of these hard to reach surgical areas with better flexibility.Personalized Surgical PlansWith the TSolution on 3D-Planning Workstation, surgeons can create a personalized surgical plan in advance for joint replacements. The workstation allows surgeons to view and manipulate a 3D model of CT scans, and compare the prospective results of different surgical options. Based on this, optimal implant placement and alignment is performed based on each patient’s unique anatomy.AI-Assisted Robotic SurgeryAI-delivered advice would be stored in the cloud for access when needed and derived by machine-learning algorithms from thousands of previous cases. For instance, cases of how thousands of previous successful surgeons traversed the anatomy, and where they took action can be accessed by the robot. The robot can make use of this information to suggest previously successful alternate options.Assistive GuidesDental and orthopedic implant robots work from a digital map of the patient, but they function as an “Assistive Guide” to the surgeon. They ensure that the human-initiated actions conform to the digital plan that was created in the preoperative phase. The robot can enforce adherence physically, avoiding deviations that could deliver non-optimal treatment.VR Surgeon TrainingSource: Maryland TodaySimulators are a way for surgeons to practice. All a surgeon needs is a motion controller for each hand and a headset the size of ski goggles. A surgeon once needed to perform 10 to 20 cases to be proficient in a new procedure. With the rising complexity in cases, this number has grown to 50–100. Thanks to VR, the duration of the training procedure has now been cut short. VR training creates the opportunity to fail without consequences. It also helps to get mistakes out of the way in training so when an emergency arises in real life, doctors won’t be facing it for the first time.Remote SurgeriesSource: Digital CIOThe CorPath SystemThe CorPath System in addition to enabling doctors to get on-site training offers the option of performing remote surgery. A cardiovascular surgeon performed a 15-minute procedure on a patient who was located 32 kilometers away. The surgeon used the system to insert a stent into the patient while monitoring the process on a screen and operating the robot arms from a distance. Surgeons are on standby with the patient and will step in within about 30 seconds in case of a malfunction. Remote surgeries can help save many lives as patients who are too ill to be transported to a location where an expert surgeon is available can benefit from it.Need for Robotics in the COVID EraRemote surgeries are a boon in the pandemic world, where even healthy people are at risk when stepping out of their homes. COVID-19-negative individuals can be kept away from high-risk hospital areas. Robotic surgery offers the most efficient and quickest way to perform non-emergent surgery with the lowest risk to personnel and quickly allowing patients to return home.Reduced transmission riskThe limited exposure to blood during minimally invasive robotic techniques means a decreased risk of exposure to any viral infection including the coronavirus for all parties involved in the procedure. Minimally invasive techniques have a self-contained operative field with less spillage of fluids and tissues, significantly reducing risk to the operative staff.ConclusionThe future of surgical robotics offers a lot more than the mechanized extensions of a surgeon’s hands. Robotic hardware and software are the next generations of tools and instruments to improve surgeon skills and patient outcomes. No matter how fast technology is advancing, surgeons need not worry about robots and AI taking over their jobs. Humans are necessary to guide surgical robots and decide what actions they take.

Le bateau utilisé (un remorqueur de 80 mètres de long et de 12 000 chevaux), vidé de son équipage et sans capitaine, a été piloté à près de 800 km de distance via des liaisons satellitaires, dans un cockpit reconstitué. Aucun équipage n’a été dépêché sur le navire pour mener à bien la mission.Un arsenal de caméras infrarouges, d’antennes, de radars, de radios, ainsi qu’un abonnement à un service satellite et quatre ans de recherche et développement dans la transmission de données et la cybersécurité auront été nécessaires pour mettre au point ce système. Si la liaison avec les satellites géostationnaires est coupée, le navire s’arrête et se positionne face au vent, en attendant d’être secouru. Le commandant de bord précise qu’un module de prévision de propagation des ondes va être ajouté, pour limiter les risques que la latence du signal satellite soit trop élevée, notamment lors de conditions météorologiques défavorables.Selon Xavier Genin, le Président de SeaOwl, la solution développée par l’entreprise permet notamment des économies de relève d’équipage et de minimiser les risques (activité maritime, piratage…).

Intro to Inertial Measurement Unit(IMU) Part 1,https://medium.com/@es14btech11011/intro-to-inertial-measurement-unit-imu-part-1-47f19fc7d68d?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Robotics,Imu,Accelerometer,Gyroscopes Industry,Magnetometer","A complete guide to understanding accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometers.Advanced Inertial Reference sphere Credits: linkThe guidance system plays a crucial role in many activities like space crafts, airplanes, and even some of the common things like our phones and some of the gaming consoles. The guidance system built in the olden days took a lot of space and also were difficult to operate. However, technology has come a long way and now we can get an IMU(Inertial Measuring Unit), the size of our thumb, or even smaller.IMU helps in giving an accurate orientation of an object with respect to its environment. Though orientation might seem trivial for humans, it is the very thing that automatically shifts our phone to portrait or landscape mode. It plays a crucial role in the navigation of planes and also spacecrafts. We will have a deep dive into the various components of a basic IMU and how to use it in this series of blogs.There is a wide range of IMUs depending upon the usage and some costing around thousands of dollars, while others(hobbyists) costing around a few dollars. Most of the hobbyist’s IMUs consist of an accelerometer and Gyroscope. Some also contain a magnetometer. We will be mostly talking about easily available IMUs. The outline of contents ->Accelerometer and its calibrationMagnetometer and its calibrationGyroscope and its calibrationFinding roll and pitch from AccelerometerFinding Yaw from MagnetometerFew Notations before we get startedroll(ɸ rotation along X-axis)pitch(θ rotation along Y-axis)Yaw(Ѱ rotation along Z-axis)AccelerometersThey measure the acceleration that is being applied on the sensor in 3 perpendicular directions. The good part of these sensors is that they are very small with close to accurate values. However, they do have a good amount of noise associated with them. The working of them can be understood by seeing the below gif. The acceleration will cause the movement of the mass which inturn produces varying voltage due to change in capacitance. This voltage is mapped to the acceleration. These values that map the change in voltage to the real world acceleration are called the sensitivity values.Figure 1: Working of an accelerometer. The movement of mass due to acceleration causes the capacitance to change across plates and hence gives a varying output voltage which is interpreted as acceleration across that axis. Credits for gif linkThough most accelerometers are calibrated in the factory before sending for sale, the values might slightly differ after these are soldered to the breakout board or the PCB. It becomes important to calibrate the accelerometer to have close to accurate values from all the three axes.Calibration of AccelerometerThe following equation represents how the accelerometer values are obtained from the internal analog-to-digital-converters(ADCs).Here p_x, p_y, p_z are scale factors that were found during original factory calibration. Similarly, offset for all three axes are also found in the same calibration.The values Gx, Gy, Gz do not give the acceleration in terms of m/s2, instead, it needs to be multiplied by the sensitivity factor depending upon the range of the acceleration and the bits used to represent Gx, Gy, GzIf the sensor has a range of acceleration 2g, then the sensitivity factor is 2g/(2¹⁶ –1), if the value is represented in 16 bits.The goal of the calibration is to find the scale and the bias to make the accelerometer accurate with the current breakout board or your own PCB. We will be assuming each axis to be independent of each other and hence looking at one specific axis. We will then apply the procedure for the remaining axis.Let us take the z-axis ->We will be taking values of Gfz when the z-axis accelerometer is parallel with gravity and point downwards and the second one when it is pointed upwards. The values of Gz in these two cases are known and it is +9.8 in the first case and -9.8 in the second case.As we know the values of G[0]fz and G[1]fz by taking the mean of the values over a few seconds. We can solve the equation for Sz and bz bySimilarly for other axes, the equations are as follows -While calibrating for X-direction, you will have to place the x-axis of the accelerometer parallel to the earth’s gravitational field.While calibrating for Y-direction, you will have to place the y-axis of the accelerometer parallel to the earth’s gravitational field.The code below does the complete calibration, you will have to place the accelerometer in 6 different positions based on the prompts by the code. However, the order of positions doesn’t matter as long as all different 6 positions are used. The code takes care of the order.The above code calculates the mean values after every direction and based on a few checks and after collecting for all directions, uses the equations discussed above to get the new scale and bias for each direction.MagnetometerThis sensor is built on the hall effect principle. It is based on the fact that a voltage is created when a magnetic field is passed perpendicular to the current flowing in the conductor. The voltage generated is measured to get an understanding of the earth’s magnetic field. Once we know the Earth’s magnetic field, we roughly know the true North.However, the magnetometer is sensitive to other magnetic fields from its surroundings apart from the Earth’s magnetic field. The two types of effects on magnetometers are normally categorized as hard iron interference and soft iron interference.Hard-Iron InterferenceSome magnetic fields are generated by permanently magnetized ferromagnetic components which are normally placed on PCB. Also, it is very common for magnetometers to come with some amount of field offset. Though the manufacturer calibrates it, there will still be some offset when it is soldered to the PCB or used in robots or elsewhere. The good thing about these interferences is that they can be modeled as another vector of magnetic field in a specific direction. Dealing with this type of interference is more like finding the bias in each direction.Soft Iron Interference -This type of magnetic field comes up when an electric current is passed through unmagnetized ferromagnetic components. These fields normally occur from batteries or other high power carrying lines on PCB. These are also a bit tougher to model as they affect a specific axis. In some approximations it can be considered as a scale for each axis, however, a better way to model it would be by using a symmetric transformation matrix(3*3).Plotting magnetometer values at various roll and pitch angles, before calibration, gives the idea of the hard iron effects and soft iron effects.Representing three different projections of the ellipsoid by using two axes at once. The separation shows the hard iron effects and the elongation along one axis shows the soft iron effects.The difference in the alignment is what represents the hard iron effects. By combining these points, you get a 3-dimensional vector that can center all the three ellipses to zero.It shows the correction of the hard iron effect.There is still some problem with the magnetometer values, there is some deviation along some axes. To correct this we will be using the transformation matrix A. The complete equation as follows -Mag = (M — V)*AWhere M represents raw mag values, V represents the 3-dimensional bias vector and A represents the symmetric transformation matrix.It shows correction of both hard-iron and soft-iron effectsApplying both soft iron and hard iron correction.There two ways to find the bias and the transformation vector from magnetometer values.A simple way -> In this method, we assume the transformation vector(V) to be a diagonal matrix. This basically means that we are assuming that all axes are independent. This basically breaks down to finding the scale parameter for each axis. The bias can be found by simply finding the mean of the magnetic values obtained in various roll and pitch configurations. The scale can be found by averaging the mean along diameter across each axis and scaling each axis to fit into that average length.2. Slightly Complex(Fitting the ellipsoid) -> The mag values mostly represent a 3-dimensional ellipsoid. The idea is to transform it into a sphere. However, to transform it into a sphere, we first need to find the parameters of its initial ellipsoid. The equation for a 3D ellipsoid is as follows.Here, M is the mag values collected over a period of time, V is considered the offset, and W is the correlation with other axes and β is the length of the ellipsoid. Once we fit a good ellipsoid, we can easily get the hard iron and soft iron corrections as Bias = V and the transformation matrix as belowWe use the least-squares method to find the best possible parameters.Note: In both cases of calibration it is important to rotate the magnetometer in an eight shape so that the sensor is exposed to various combinations of roll and pitch.Credits to ellipsoid fit function linkGyroscope -This sensor measures angular velocity plays which a crucial role in tracking the orientation during movement. It is often used in various filters with an accelerometer and magnetometer to get a more accurate and stable orientation. It is based on the Coriolis principle where a force is acted on by a mass that is moving with velocity and angular velocity is applied to it. In the gif below, the spring moves constantly in one direction. As angular velocity is applied, it starts slightly displacing in the perpendicular direction which changes the capacitance and thus gives a difference in electrical voltage. This difference is mapped to the angular velocity through the sensitivity factor.Gif: The spring moves only in the driving direction when no angular rate, however when it is applied the spring changes the capacitance between electrodes. credits linkCalibration of Gyroscope -The gyroscope mainly has a bias that needs to be subtracted from the sensor readings to give an accurate estimate. This bias can be calculated by taking a bunch of sensor readings when the sensor is still. Average these readings in all the directions to get a 3 element vector of bias of the gyroscope. This bias has to be later subtracted for every reading to get the actual angular velocity.If all the gyro values display zero readings(when IMU is stationary), it confirms that calibration has been done.Estimating roll and pitch from Accelerometer values:This part involves some math and it requires an understanding of rotation matrices. I try to give a brief understanding of them here, however, if you want to dig deep in them, here is a link.Most of the orientation is expressed in three terms where roll is for rotation about x-axis, pitch is for rotation about y-axis and yaw is rotation around z-axis. The combination of these three rotations can easily express any complex rotation. As discussed in the start, one of the use cases of IMU is to find the orientation. With an accelerometer, we know the acceleration vector Gs in the sensor frame. We also know that the acceleration on earth is g.Where a is the external acceleration on the sensor and R is a rotation matrix representing roll, pitch, and yaw.One of the common assumptions made with IMUs is that the external acceleration will be zero. This makes sense as we mostly measure the accelerometer in very small time intervals in which there isn’t much impact by external acceleration and thus this assumption mostly holds out. There are cases where this can be bad to have this assumption and that will be discussed at the end.Considering a = 0Intuitively the equation above suggests that the earth’s gravitational is rotated by R to give the specific accelerometer values in the sensor frame. Essentially we have to find R to get the orientation. Before we go on to find R, I would like to state that it is not possible to find yaw with accelerometer readings alone. The main reason for this is because the z-axis is parallel to the earth’s gravitational force. A change in roll and pitch will be seen in sensor values, but when you change yaw, there won’t be any difference in sensor values. Intuitively, it is like measuring an angle between 2 parallel lines, it is zero and will be zero when you rotate one line in the plane perpendicular to the lines. We will be using a magnetometer to get the heading(yaw) of the sensor.The rotation matrix can be divided further -> R = Rx(ɸ)*Ry(θ)*Rz(ѱ)WhereThe above are standard equations of rotation where each angle is assumed to have a clockwise rotation.Actually there are 6 possible ways for R, since the order of the rotation matters. It can be ->The order of rotations in equations 5 to 8 will give the yaw in the equations and hence it doesn’t make sense to include them or compute them as the yaw obtained would be one of the many solutions. We will be mostly looking at equation rotation of 3 and 4.Taking the order of equation 3By dividing the second and third-row we getUsing sin(ɸ) we can get pitch by dividing 1 and 2 rows. Substituting for sin(ɸ) we getTaking the order of equation 4Dividing equation 1st and 3rd row, we getUsing a similar concept as in the first method we can get roll by -Using tan inverse we can find both roll and pitch.Estimating Yaw using magnetometer:The IMU when placed flat on the ground/table and made to point towards the magnetic north, then it has only x and z components. The measurement during that time would beHere Bs is the mag values by the sensor and Br is a scalar representing the magnetic strength in that area. In this case, the sensor is aligned with the magnetic field, but to represent a generic case, we can do it by adding the rotation matrix.As we know roll and pitch already, we can try multiplying with its inverse on both sides. An inverse of a rotation matrix is basically replacing the angle with -1*angle.Taking the LHS side:Now taking RHS side:Equating both LHS and RHSBy dividing 1st and 2nd row we get yaw as Br gets canceled.We will be requiring both roll and pitch for estimating yaw from mag values.Gimbal LockThis is something that was very common in apollo missions and especially apollo 13 which was dangerous and also very difficult for astronauts to navigate avoiding it. Gimbal lock can be disastrous because it doesn’t completely reflect the changes happening in the real world rotations in terms of Euler angles. More precisely speaking, this normally happens by loosing one of the dimensions. It can be mathematically seen belowBy taking θ as π/2, we can see the above equation can be reduced toIf you change the roll(ϕ) or the yaw(ψ), but the rotation happens along only the z-axis. This is also seen as losing one degree of freedom(in this case roll).This basically happens when a plane starts pointing upwards or downwards. It is more common with some of our daily devices like phones or gaming consoles. In these cases, people use different configurations of roll, pitch, and yaw to avoid the gimbal lock or sometimes they use a completely different representation like quaternion(which we will cover in the next blog).ConclusionNow that we have figured out a way to get the orientation from the accelerometer and magnetometer, but these readings come with a good amount of noise. We can definitely use some smoothing functions over these values to reduce some noise. However, a better method is to use the gyroscope’s information to better estimate the orientation. For that, we will be talking about sensor fusion algorithms like Kalman and Madgwick in the next blog. We will be covering basic math with respect to the IMU. We will follow that up with a complete guide to implementing these on raspberry pi 3 with MPU9250.Let me know your thoughts in the comments or any doubts related to the article.Written byNiranjan ReddyRobotics, Statistics, ML and CV deployment on hardware.Follow1 Thanks to Ajay Surya. 1 1 RoboticsImuAccelerometerGyroscopes IndustryMagnetometerMore from Niranjan ReddyFollowRobotics, Statistics, ML and CV deployment on hardware.More From MediumQuantum Teleportation: Paving the Way for a Quantum InternetGabi Skoff in The StartupSuper-Intelligent Humans Are ComingNautilusThe Admiral of the String Theory WarsNautilus in Nautilus MagazineGravity-Based Life As We Don’t Know ItLenka Otap in PredictHow many colors are really in a rainbow?Ethan Siegel in Starts With A Bang!The Sleep Studies from HellScienceDuuude in History of YesterdayThe myth of the multiverse and the dilemma for quantum computingJon Ellard in The Change ActivistsAnts Go MarchingNautilus in Nautilus MagazineAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
New loneliness antidote : A robot,https://medium.com/@rajmer/new-loneliness-antidote-a-robot-3c92346a82f6?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Pepper,Robots,Robotics,Mental Health,AI","Lonely, I’m Mr. LonelyI have nobody for my ownOh, I’m so lonelyI’m Mr. LonelyI have nobody for my ownOh, I’m so lonelyRemember this one from singer Akon? The song resonates with the feelings of millions of people who feel lonely. No wonder this song was an instantaneous hit. Statistically speaking, in UK alone the number of over-50s experiencing loneliness is set to reach two million by 2026 which is a 49% increase in 10 years. To make the things worse, problem of loneliness aggravated further during the pandemic. In care homes, carers were busy fighting COVID-19 hence their soothing conversations with the aged became a thing of the past. Just imagine sitting in a closed room for hours without talking to anyone. Our aged needed some desperate help.But, if humans can’t help, then who can?A Robot. Looks like a wish come true for the Star Wars fans. C-3PO is real now. Its name is Pepper.Pepper Image courtesy Alex Knight at https://unsplash.comThese specially programmed 4 feet tall robots has been visiting care homes to help reduce feelings of loneliness in the aged people. Pepper uses Artificial Intelligence to hold a normal human like conversation. It can even learn about people’s tastes after chatting to them for some time. Not only this, it can also play music and run exercise classes. Pepper can share what they learn about individuals with carers.A study of Pepper’s impact showed that, after two weeks, there was a small drop in feelings of loneliness among aged people it spoke to. Not bad for a machine.But who is Pepper?Pepper is the world’s first social humanoid robot able to recognize faces and basic human emotions. Its manufactured by SoftBank Robotics (formerly Aldebaran Robotics), designed with the ability to read emotions. It was first introduced in a conference on 5 June 2014.How did Pepper pull off this feat in care homes?The secret is in the Pepper’s software, called CARESSES, short for “Culture-Aware Robots and environmental Sense of Systems for Elderly Support”. CARESSES was being developed in a international project. Program was funded by the European Commission and the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications of Japan. The project started on the 1st January 2017 and ended on the 31st January 2020, just in time before pandemic entered european borders.Technology is good.

The big daddy of this field is ROS which provides all the functioning you need from validating your idea to real-time working controllers and all other good stuff but these much functionality comes with a price of complexity (as i feel while using ROS) another rising name is CoppeliaSim which is a great piece of software and a great tool for validating your ideas to controlling them in real-time, but again what i feel problematic in CoppeliaSim is its documentation for Python Api as it is designed to use with Lua programming language.

"Smiling, laughing, loving — what is behind the smile of our baby?",https://medium.com/illumination/smiling-laughing-loving-what-is-behind-the-smile-of-our-baby-ff565095d458?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"Parenting,Neuroscience,Pregnancy,Cognition,Robotics","Social smiles appear earliest after 4 weeks of life. Kids try to make parents smile back as much as possible. www.pixbubble.comSmiles, laughter, giggles — as soon as the baby’s face lights up into a guileless smile, even the grumpiest passer-by melts and has to smile. Smiles are the reward for parents for all those sleepless nights and the manifestation of the connection which we yearn for from the first day of childbirth.A smile tells us that everything is fine.A smile makes us laugh back.The smile makes us feel good.When can a baby really start laughing? And why are they smiling?What happens in the brain of a child and an adult when they laugh?Does it have any effect on the development of the baby in the uterus and on the newborn, whether his mother often laughs or is depressed?How can robotics help us to understand the effects smiles have on us?First smilesOnce you bring your newborn baby home, you might be seeing a smile in every tremor of his face, hoping that the kid is smiling at you, trying to tell you something. You might not be willing for anything in the world hear that it could only be an automatic reflex because researchers say that a social smile does not come until week 6. So how is it?It was long thought that babies cannot laugh up to 6 weeks after delivery and it was assumed that most newborn behaviors are primarily reflexive. At those times, however, there were no 4D scanners and ultrasound devices, thanks to which we are today able to look inside the uterus and find out what is going on there.Nadja Reissland and her colleagues from University of Durham, UK, showed, that we can enjoy a child’s smile much earlier than after delivery. Using a 4D scanner, they monitored the babies’ faces in the womb and examined their facial expressions — such as sucking, blinking, mouthing, yawning, smiling, crying, scowling, etc, following a former research of Fang Yan et al.. They observed various facial movements of fetuses in the womb (such as inner/outer brow raise, cheek raiser, nose wrinkle, lip pull, chin raiser, mouth stretch, lip suck, etc.). The study shows that these movements are between 24th and 35th week of pregnancy increasingly often coocurring together in various patterns, creating more stable facial expressions (e.g., cry-like or laughter-like expression). But what is behind this smile, what happens in the brain of the fetus, how is our baby feeling? We are not sure. One interpretation might be, that it indicates contentment and well-being in a stress-free environment…Illustration of neutral (a,b) faces, laughter-like (c ) and crying-like (d) faces (link)In 2005, another study explored in detail a process of crying in the womb and revealed that by 20 weeks of pregnancy, baby can perform various actions, which are connected to crying (as extending the tongue, opening the jaw, coordinating complex breathing efforts, quivering the chin and swallowing). In the third trimester of pregnancy (24 weeks) they startled the fetuses with a low-decibel noise. The video they recorded using ultrasound showed that these actions can already in 24 weeks co-occur and first non-vocal cry starts. First audible crying does not happen before the transition to the outside world…For the first tears, we will have to wait even longer.Thanks to these studies, we now know that the fetus can already smile in the womb or cry softly without tears.What is needed from the brain to produce a smile? First, we have to wait until motoric brain areas develop to the extend that motor programs for individual facial movements are available. Then, the necessary precondition is coordinated neural activity which appears around 24 weeks of pregnancy (brain wave recordings show by this time coordinated, but not yet fully continuous activity). Via studying different types of laughing including pathological laughing, neuroscience in recent years enabled us to uncover a bit more which brain structures are important for processing smiles. It seems, that two parts of brain play the major role in creating smile-like facial expressions — basal ganglia (sub-cortical area) and frontal cortex. These accept emotional triggers from amygdala (that processes emotional stimuli) and send orders to the motoric cortex to produce motor programs for expressions which make muscles to move in the way, that we can then observe a smile. The first ‘smiles’ are then just a testing of wiring of the brain and testing if multiple areas are well connected.First ‚social‘ smiles are (even in the 21st century) considered to appear earliest after the 4th week after the delivery. What is behind those first smiles which we observe in the womb and soon after delivery is still unknown. Are they expressing positive emotions and contentment? Are those only reflexes? Or are they testing the brain connectivity? Is it just an inborn instinct to smile which babies are born with (to keep us parents happy and attached)? These questions are not yet answered. Maybe, it is some combination of these?To enjoy the first ‘social’ smiles, meaning that the baby smiles in response to someone’s else smile, we must wait for maturation of vision of newborns to be able to properly focus and recognize facial expressions on other people faces. It takes up to 3 months after delivery until the baby’s vision matures. In the first weeks after delivery babies might recognize face-like shapes (and there is even a study that they might be able to do so already in the womb), but they cannot see facial expressions on others faces. 4 months old babies can already discriminate between some of the expressions and start using their own facial expressions for communication. At 10 months babies can reliably detect various types of emotions on others faces.What happens in our brain when we smile?When that innocent face smiles at you, it’s impossible to not smile back. This seems to be one of the reasons why our babies are laughing at us — to make us laugh at them back.It seems that babies smile just enough to make the mothers smile back, to trigger their attention. Watching their own babies, especially smiling, affects mothers both physically and emotionally. It turns out that when first-time mother sees her own infant, an extensive brain region is activated. On top, when she sees her baby smiling, brain regions connected to reward are activated and produce the hormone dopamine. In the brain, there are specialized brain regions devoted for processing observed facial expressions. In fMRI scanning studies, mothers were observing their babies smiling and thanks to that brain areas involved in processing emotions (such as amygdala) as well as areas connected to reward (dopaminergic) were activated.Whenever you laugh, there are happening magical things in your brain. There is a whole discipline called “gelatology”, which studies effects of different types of laughing on our body. Research has shown that smiling can improve our overall health. Laughter is a great cardiovascular exercise and it has positive effects on blood flow, blood vessels and our heart — on average, laughter increased blood flow by 22%, while stress decreased blood flow by 35%. Smiling also boosts our immune system. It has been also shown that laughter affects the release of various immune mediators and thus increases our immunity.During laughing, 4 different types of hormones are produced, that heal up the body, relieve stress, lower heart rate, increase productivity and reduce your anxiety (hormones are special messengers, which are secreted by endocrine glands to our blood and spread around the body to maintain several body functions). The first type of hormones produced during laughing are neuropeptides, that work on relieving stress and communicate our positive feelings around the body. Serotonin is helping the body to heal up, repair wounds, reduce depression and regulate anxiety. Endorphins, the third type, are able to block areas in our brain which are causing stress and pain. The hormones spread around the body, lower the heart rate and blood pressure. The last, dopamine, increases our motivation and thus productivity via rewarding us with positive feelings (like when we achieve something). Did you know, that one smile provides you with the same amount of brain stimulation as 2000 chocolate bars? This was measured by British researchers, who used an electromagnetic brain scan machine and heart-rate monitor to measure these effects of laughing.Taking this into account, our babies via forcing us to smile actually makes us healthier (while pumping happy hormones also to their little bodies :)😊. And then tell someone that raising kids is only one-sided effort…The level of the hormones produced while smiling might also play a role in how the brain of the baby grows and develops. If there are high levels of stress hormone in the baby body, the development of the brain might be slowed down . As noted by Laura Markham in her book Peaceful parent, happy kid (btw, I really like this book and there is no paid promotion in this message) it seems that for a proper development, babies should during the first year of their life mainly feel safe and happy.When you smile together, both of your brains are releasing hormones, which make you both happy, and on top the development of the baby’s brain might be enhanced.How mood of the mother affects the fetus?Feeling happy, laughing every day or being depressed and overwhelmed? Mothers during pregnancy do not have it easy. A lot of things change and time for themselves is shrinking. And on top, they get stressed, if their stress has can anyhow affect the baby which they carry. So how is it? Does it really matter how does the mother feel? Does the mood of mother anyhow affect the kid which is in the womb, protected from the outside world, fed by good food? As laughing has so many positive effects as mentioned above, it has actually affect also on the fetus — not only vitamins and proteins are coming to the baby via umbilical cord.Laughing make you less stress, less anxious, less depressed, any amount of smiles during pregnancy is positive. Prenatal depression might have direct impact on infants. It was for example shown that infants of depressed and anxious mothers are less responsive to faces and voices. Some of the studies are a bit less reliable and harder to interpret — as a study, where they studied behavior of fetus in the womb of 15 mothers using 4D scan. It seems that with the increased anxiety of moms, the fetuses were more often touching own face by their left hands. Anyway, the level of stress was evaluated based on self-reported values, there were only 57 scans of these 15 fetuses, so overall, I have doubts about the validity of this research. Nevertheless, it seems that there might be some connection between how relaxed is the mother and how happy is the kid.Unsurprisingly, parenting style (how much are parents laughing) has also effect on infants. The parenting style on 9 months old infants seems to have a direct impact on future social development of the kid.So be relaxed and laugh a lot!Smiling robotsTo find out what is behind the babies smiles and what it triggers in the heads of their parents, researchers around the world also started to program baby-like robots and simulations.Biologically inspired simulated artificial baby Baby X can imitate facial expressions of real toddlers as well as many other toddler behavior and was used to study for example how kids are learning to read…BabyX robot introduced.Baby-like robot from University San Diego was used to study the interaction between the robot and human. This robot can imitate baby facial expressions and automatically perceive and produce smiles during interactions with people. US researchers studied interactions between infants and mothers and ported the smile timing strategy which are infants using to this baby-like robot. They found out, that this strategy was able to maximize adult-only smile time (compared to 3 other types of smiling behavior). This suggests that 4 months old infants smile at parents only as much as needed to maximize their smiling times. It turns out that by 4 months old, “mothers consistently attempted to maximize the time spent in mutual smiling, while infants tried to maximize mother-only smile time.” It seems that infants are able to manipulate mothers to smile at them as much as possible while they can just time their smiles properly.Smiling Diego-San robot (PLOS ONE: Infants Time Their Smiles to Make Their Moms Smile/Paul Ruvolo, et al.).Smile is incredibly strong. It can heal your body, it boosts your immune system, it makes you happy, it helps you to bond to your child. Any occasion is a good reason for a smile. The best is to smile together 😊.

N/A,https://medium.com/@oishika/should-robots-be-treated-as-human-9a6a22255687?source=tag_archive---------4-----------------------,"Robots,Ethics,Robotics","“Sometimes bad things happen to good robots.” These were the last words of a small, beer-bucket headed, smiling robot named hitchBOT, with pool-noodles for arms and legs, that relied on strangers’ kindness to hitchhike across North America. It was left on the streets of Salem, Massacheussets on July 17 of 2015 by its creators and was hoping to make its way across and over to the West Coast. It made its way through Boston to NewYork, and during its journey, it managed to make friends, and garner love and attention on social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. On the fateful day of August 1, 2015 it met with a brutal accident and was left in a gutter, quite ironically in the City of Brotherly Love-Philadelphia. A surveillance video showed a man in a football jersey remorselessly kicking the robot till it was immobile. Arms and legs torn apart, and head damaged beyond repair, HitchBOT was maimed in the worst way imaginable. The event sparked widespread outrage on social media, with some members of the local tech community wanting to help repair the robot free of cost (Victor). Decidedly nothing hitech, HitchBOT was designed not as a measure to test the advances in technology but the goodness of people (Herzeld 377).More recently, a security robot was smashed to the ground in Silicon Valley. Another security bot in San Francisco was smothered by being wrapped in a tarp, and smeared in barbecue sauce. “It is a global phenomenon”(Bromwich). In a mall in Osaka, Japan, three young boys punched and kicked a robot with all their strength. A link to the video can be found on the Works Cited page at the end of this paper. In Moscow, a man attacked a teaching robot named Alantim with a baseball bat, kicking it to the ground, while the robot pleaded for help.Despite the fact all these robots were entities without sentience, which meant that they were devoid of the capacity to experience pain, there is something unsettling about the idea of a robot being dismembered and butchered by one of us. This hesitation arises from the fact that a human being, the same as you and me, is capable of feeling such violent emotions towards an inanimate, harmless hitchhiking bot. In a post on Salon the next day after the incident, Arthur Chu pointed out the unwarranted and unexpected nature of the attack, by stating that, “Anyone who didn’t want to play along with the conceit of hitchBOT’s personhood could just keep walking. There was nothing to obtain by smashing it beyond repair, except the brief thrill of feeling powerful over something”, but hitchBOT was “hurt” regardless. Why did the perpetrator of the act behave this way? Even before psychoanalysing the person, the more important question is do we care about an inanimate, unfeeling robot being butchered and ripped apart? If so, why do we care? Do we wish to prevent this sort of action in the future? Do we want people to mercilessly stop beating up robots? If so, are we necessarily hinting that robots and the like should be entitled to some form of rights, or are we simply stating that humans should be constrained by certain laws to perform such brutal acts on robots?A report in a recent newspaper article (Faiola 2005) that stated that the Japanese government has decided to establish a committee to outline guidelines for the safekeeping of robots in homes and offices. “What issues might arise if an android(for the purposes of this paper the terms android and robot will be used interchangeably to mean very, or not very, human-like artificially created entities) reached a stage at which the public perceives that the android should be subject to some form of legal constraint and entitled to some form of legal protection?” (Inayatullah 2001). In analysing this premise one must remember at all points, that we are discussing the establishment of a “political subdivision that is capable of making and enforcing laws that will apply not just directly to an android rather than just to the designer or builder”(Calverley 403).2. The Rights TalkIn the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, rights are defined as “entitlements (not) to perform certain actions, or (not) to be in certain states; or entitlements that others (not) perform certain actions or (not) be in certain states”. It is imperative now, for the purposes of this paper, for me to follow this discussion of rights by distinguishing the qualities between legal and natural rights. Legal rights, according to modern positivists like Hans Kelsen and Richard Tur are what the law says they are, independent of morality(Calverley 404). “There is therefore, in this view, no necessary relation between any given set of human characteristics (say, the ability to reason and reflect) and legal personality. Moreover, there is no minimal threshold level of intelligence required to constitute a person”(Davis and Naffeine). Natural rights, on the other hand, refer to inalienable rights that are possessed by someone or something by the virtue of being. Here rights are viewed as being inherent in man and considered divine. These rights are exclusive of the aforementioned legal rights, and give rise to moral obligations. For instance, Isaac Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics are more so consistent with these kind of rights, but for robot. They are:A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.Denial of natural rights to robots-legal or natural-since they are considered ‘other’, as not sentient, and thus not part of our consideration-becomes of an exemplar of how we treat other humans, plants, animals and civilisations. Like children, the environment, and future generations, robots do not have adequate representation(and thus are considered rightless). Since they are so different, why should they be given rights-legal or natural? (Inayatulla). From this argument, it follows naturally therefore to ask why children, future generations, and the environment don’t have enough rights as of yet, and to contemplate thereafter when these entities become capable of acquiring more rights. To answer these questions, we look at two different subdivisions. A second and more interesting analogy can be drawn between androids, and children and individuals with impairments. The question here is: “Do humans in a persistent vegetative state lose the status of legal person while still remaining human at the genetic level? Likewise, children and individuals with serious mental impairments are treated as persons for some purposes but not for others, although they are human. Personhood can be defined in a way that gives moral and legal weight to attributes that we ultimately define as relevant without the requirement that the entity either be given the full legal rights of humans or burden them with the duties those rights entail” (Calverley 2005b). While this paper in no way seeks to present partisan arguments about abortion and/or personal views, it does however wish to present briefly the ethical dilemna posed by bioethicists around the world. Each of these dilemmas is based on the question of when is one deemed capable of ownership of rights. Pro-abortionists argue that a clump of cells does not have the right to live, otherwise amputating a limb might also be considered murder. A collection of cells only has a right to live provided it has reached a certain stage of development. Anti-abortionists argue that a fetus has a unique genetic code, and that killing an individual being that has the potential to grow up to be an individual and have a future like ours, is wrenching from someone their right to life(BBC). When it comes to adults with impairments and children, we face the concept of moral agent vs moral subject yet again, in that while they are not held responsible for just about everything(as in the case of the cat killing the mouse), they are however, considered moral subjects. For instance, children are not subject to the same set of legal rights as adults, and for this reason they are often tried in different courts as compared to adults; and there is good reason for this. Because a child’s brain has not reached the optimum level of maturity as in adults, they cannot be expected to make the same decisions as them.Their natural rights remain the same, regardless.We can use this same train of thought to advocate for why androids must receive rights in the future. That we assign varying levels of value to different forms of life is obvious; and this value seems to have a co-relation with two attributes-the ability to feel pain and the level of intelligence of the organism. If one were to argue for the former, it could be said that “because it(androids) is created by humans, it can be given any of the required characteristics, once we have determined that those are the necessary and sufficient characteristics to create consciousness”(Calverley 409). If, “when we see the functional MRI of a person’s brain, we are not inhibited in our ability to relate to that person as a meaning-filled other”, then considering the stage when science advances so as to be able to imbibe neurotransmitters into androids such that it released the exact same chemicals as we do when we associate a certain reaction to a certain feeling, can we then say that an android is capable of feeling pain and deserving of rights(Turkle)? Does the android then become capable of moral consideration? Secondly, the fact that we associate the intelligence of an organism to the value that we give to its life should provide more foundation as to why robots and androids, should all the more, have rights. Androids are designed with one purpose in mind, to make them more capable than humans, to ensure that they have a higher level of intelligence than humans. Therefore, must we argue here that androids’ well-being must be given utmost importance by virtue of being the most intelligent of all. However, the idea of bestowing human and animal rights upon an artificially created being still seems a bit off. “The way to create an android that could give rise to forces bent on curtailing the process. When people begin to consider the moral implications of the development process, implications for other aspects of life loom large. Not only do we have to consider the impact on humanity, but also on the android; our creation may plausibly argue at some point that it is a moral subject”(Calverley). This may be the case because even though the end results are the same, there is considerable difference between the origin of life naturally, and the origin of life in a Petri dish. But consider the following two situations:The best artificially intelligent robot in the world today has an IQ of 40. Is it morally wrong to disconnect all of its wires, for the creation of a more efficient robot?A company decides to make robots which are designed specifically to provide companionship to people.Thenm is it wrong to rape and beat up such a robot? (For instance, if you’re familiar with the TV series West World, imagine a situation of the sort where humans use these humanoid robots for the gratification of their sexual and emotional needs).3. ConclusionIn Turkle’s essay, Relational Authenticity in the Age of Digital Companions, she explores the emotional effects of robots’ “mimicry” on humans. She introduces us to Elisa, a computer program that was designed to interact with humans by mimicking human responses, and was one of the first of its kind. Much to the surprise of its creator, it was treated as more than just a “parlour game”, in that some students not only preferred to talk with Elisa, but also wanted to be alone with it. “Psychoanalytic self psychology helps us think about the human effects of this kind of mimicry. Heinz Kohut describes how some people may shore up their fragile sense of self by turning another person into a “self object” (Ornstein, 1978). Turkle suggests that even though people still prefer “real” connections over technological consolations, we are rushing towards a future where self-denial and coping mechanisms are conveniently complemented by a software. She argues that robots, such as Paro, which were successful initiatives of the Japanese government to take care of the elderly, help “shore up people’s narcissistic abilities”(Turkle). While this paper will not argue further that statement, it will however forecast the different effects of such robots on humans.When hitchBOT was beheaded in Philadelphia, more than the grief of losing a non-sentient being, a robot, what really surprised most of us was the fact that someone was capable of displaying such heightened levels of violence and anger. hitchBot’s moral status was derived from its relationship to the humans it encountered along the way. For instance, Immanuel Kant has the belief that “causing injury to an animal had moral significance if it lessened one’s likelihood of treating humans properly”(Calverley 406). Secondly, if we look at popular culture movies such as Star Wars; a lot of us that watched it often felt a sense of connection to R2D2, even though it was a robot which was programmed to behave in a certain way. Furthermore, in Kubrick’s movie, 2001: A Space Odyssey, we see that when HAL 200(the ship’s computer with human-like personalities) realises that he was about to be disconnected, he cuts off the astronaut’s life support in retaliation. Must we therefore, also consider the hypothetical scenario, where robots who are raped and beaten, and are also programmed to feel certain emotions, might retaliate in a similar manner?To avoid such situations, it seems only natural to grant androids certain rights. Isaac Asimov’s The Three Laws of Robotics, seems like a good place to start. But while we do consider this to be a plausible scenario, we must remember to not grant autonomy to robots. Robots should be treated as moral agents and not moral subjects. “A simulation of the quality of Rachael in Blade Runner could inspire love on a par with what we feel toward people. In thinking about the meaning of love, however, we need to know not only what the people are feeling but what the robots are feeling”(Turkle 515). But while it is true that robots are not feeling anything, it also the case that vandalising such a robot may bring out the worst instincts in people. For instance, Ted Kaczynski was so deeply affected by the impact of the industrial revolution, he went ahead and decided to mail bombs to notable members of the scientific field, including bioengineers, and physicists, and professors. What is to say then, that a person who is so deeply affected by hitting and kicking a robot every day, might not want to go out there and still hurt a human being just for the thrill of it? It is for these reasons that we propose a statute that is applicable only to androids, and is established after a thorough discourse, that limits human-android relation in a way such that it helps cease in bringing out the worst aspects of people.Written byA Big HeadI try to write about just about everything!Follow50 50 50 RobotsEthicsRoboticsMore from A Big HeadFollowI try to write about just about everything!More From MediumUse Cases of Computer Vision in the Sports IndustryRequestum in Quick CodeTech Giants Are Paying Huge Salaries for Scarce AI TalentThe New York Times in The New York TimesGenetic Algorithms in Rust for Autonomous Agents: An IntroductionMithiScary AI Is More ‘Fantasia’ Than ‘Terminator’Nautilus in Nautilus MagazineReview On MobileNet v1Arun Mohan in Data Driven InvestorAnother AI Winter Could Usher in a Dark Period for Artificial IntelligencePopular Science in Popular ScienceThe Real Scandal of AI: Awful Stock PhotosAdam GeitgeyResearch for Beneficial Artificial IntelligenceFuture of LifeAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

S’il a tout l’air d’un jouet pour enfant, Bittle permet en réalité de s’entraîner à monter et à développer un véritable robot.Agile et rapide comme le robot “Spot” de Boston Dynamics dont il ressemble à s’y méprendre, Bittle sera personnalisable à volonté grâce à ses données en “open source”, ce qui permettra ainsi à la communauté mondiale de collaborer à la création de programmes dérivés (comme par exemple, la réalisation d’acrobaties ou l’interaction avec d’autres robots). Bittle se veut plus résistant que Nybble de par ses matériaux, et plus performant. Il peut mémoriser des dizaines de modèles de comportement et a une autonomie d’environ une heure.Le kit de base (d’une valeur de 225$) comprendra un boîtier de programmation, les pièces de la structure (imprimées en 3D), des servomoteurs et un ensemble de composants électroniques (une batterie, un contrôleur Arduino NyBoard V1 et des modules Bluetooth et WiFi). Des modules supplémentaires, comme une mini caméra ou des capteurs, pourront être ajoutés.
