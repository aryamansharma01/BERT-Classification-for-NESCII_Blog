My 9 All-Time Favorite Productivity Tools,https://medium.com/the-ascent/my-9-all-time-favorite-productivity-tools-84ca589cce8d?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Productivity,Technology,Life,Work,Software","Photo by Ameer Basheer on UnsplashFrom cold showers to waking up at 4 AM every day — I’ve done it all when it comes to lifehacking and productivity over the last 6 years. My entire life is a productivity experiment.I’d have to be an idiot (entirely possible) to *not* have learned a few ways by now to get back time, that can help you in your life. I have written thousands of extra blog posts and social media posts thanks to the time these tools below gave me.Why do you need an extra hour back in your day? So you can create rather than endlessly consume.You need time back to create. These productivity tools can help (no secret promotions or commissions, just real talk).Trello AppHello Trello! Changed my life man, seriously.A messy mind like mine needs visuals. Trello is the answer to visualizing the daily tasks associated with your goals. When you can clearly see what you have to do in gorgeous colors with deadlines on each task, you can do anything. All the blocks that are tasks have a deadline.If the task is not due yet, it has no color. If the task is done it turns a gorgeous green. If you have been lazy, the task turns red.Create a Trello board for work and your personal life. It will make a huge difference.James Clear’s newsletterThis guy is the ultimate productivity nerd.Why learn the skills needed to be productive when James can punch you in the face and drop your head in an icy cold bucket of cold water for free each week? I don’t know the guy personally but I worship his productivity hacks. Join his weekly newsletter if you want time back to spend elsewhere.Apple Notes AppThere is so many fancy note-taking apps on the market. They all suck. The Apple Notes app is free and it’s all you need.The functions I use the most are:Pinned notesPlacing emoji’s in the title of a note to make it stand out“Scan Document” which captures the text from any photo (like a receipt needed for your tax return)Titles and headingsCloud storage that syncs with all my devices (phone, desktop, tablet)The notes app you need has been right under your nose this whole time.Often the free stuff you overlook is just as good, if not better, than the overpriced paid subscriptions that complicate the heck out of your life.Brave BrowserI used to be a Chrome man. That was until they started abusing my privacy and spying on me in the shower. Never again. Brave is the answer to privacy.Brave will make you more productive because it loads quickly, blocks ads, and updates like an automated house cleaner who scrubs your toilet bowl for you when you’re not home. Get it. Bam.OneTab Browser ExtensionSick of having a million tabs open? Browser crashed and lost all the windows and tabs you had open?OneTab is the productivity answer. On a single page you can see all of your tabs. It allows you to have one browser window open instead of hundreds (that was Tim Version 1.6 in 2011).Minimize the number of windows you have open on your computer to experience the magic of clear thinking once again while you create.“Focus on being productive instead of busy” — Tim FerrissiTunes for music soundtracksBefore you stab me in the back with a comment, yes I know the product is dead. If there’s a better solution for music then I’m open to it. Let me know.In the meantime, I use iTunes and still love the old girl. She allows me to listen to movie soundtracks while I attempt to be creative. The user interface is stupidly simple for normies like me.Get a music app on your devices and use it to tune out the world, so you can tune into your thoughts.ConvertKit Email ManagementWhatever you do in life, build an audience. Even if it’s only 100 people, it will change your life.Sending emails to more than one person at the same time is complicated. That’s where ConvertKit comes in. ConvertKit allows you to create landing pages to collect email addresses respectfully, and email those subscribers with helpful content every so often (weekly is ideal, not daily).The magic is being able to run automation so people think you’re sending lots of emails and being clever when it’s really the software doing it for you. It gets better when you start to segment your email subscribers. Some people are okay with daily emails and others will sentence you to death if you email them more than once a week.ConvertKit allows you to segment people based on their individual interests, behaviors and preferences. Customization leads to personalization.Having an audience can help you do incredible things in life. Why? Because you can’t change the world on your own. If you’ve been wasting hours and hours with complicated email software, then get back loads of time in your day with proper email management.Kindle App on iPadPart of the reason I’m so productive is because of all the books I’ve read over the years. The Kindle app keeps me productive because it allows me to fire up a book lightning-fast and read it. It lets me highlights sentences too, which I come back to later, and often quote in my blog posts.Many people underestimate load time and an easy to use app menu. The quicker you can get to the task at hand the quicker you can tap into your creativity and explore your imagination.Leaders in their field read. Read to become more productive.Stripe (to get paid)Okay, I’m a bit of a fanboy with this one. I met the two Stripe Founders in Melbourne a few years ago. That aside, they made getting paid on the internet easy. I use Stripe to get paid from businesses who pay me for various services, strangers who need a coach, people who purchase products from my website, and the platforms who pay me royalties.When you want to get paid online, the question that matters is this: does the payment app allow people from as many countries as possible to pay you? If the answer is yes that’s key. The more places people can pay you from, the more income you can earn.Stripe also allows you to split payments. This is important because revenue share is the language of the internet. Partnering with people is far easier than building everything yourself.When I sell a digital product online, Stripe allows me to split the payment in realtime with the person I’m working with. This reduces friction, speed to market, and time spent keeping track of who owes who.Why is getting paid important for productivity? Earning money online helps you stress less, work less, and help others with your money. From this more relaxed state of mind you can buy back time to do work you love.Productivity tools are a life-saver. Whether you get inspired by the tools I use or find your own, it doesn’t matter. The point of productivity is to find the time you need to create, so you can feel fulfilled and perhaps discover a meaning for your life.Productivity helps you create.Productivity helps you think.Productivity helps you write.Productivity helps you find time to relax.Use productivity as a weapon against distractions and your forgetful mind, to create the best work of your life.Join my email list with 40K+ people for more helpful insights.The AscentA community of storytellers documenting the journey to happiness and fulfillment.Follow4.8K 42 ProductivityTechnologyLifeWorkSoftware4.8K claps4.8K claps42 responsesWritten byTim DenningFollowAussie Blogger with 100M+ views — Writer for CNBC & Business Insider.

Como a falta de uma boa comunicação pode arruinar a qualidade do seu software,https://medium.com/revista-tspi/como-a-falta-de-uma-boa-comunica%C3%A7%C3%A3o-pode-arruinar-a-qualidade-do-seu-software-4eb2bd4c1fbb?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Comunica,Qualidade,Software","Time vector created by stories — www.freepik.comJá parou para pensar que um processo que envolve troca de informações entre dois ou mais interlocutores com intuito de transferir significado de uma pessoa para outra pode influenciar no resultado do produto de sua organização? Pois é, o grande “x” da questão se chama COMUNICAÇÃO.Vivemos em um mundo onde vários métodos são utilizados para atingir um ou mais resultados. Quando falamos em Desenvolvimento de Software, entramos em uma área onde a maioria das empresas utilizam dois modelos de desenvolvimento, que são: ágil(interativo e incremental) ou tradicional(cascata, modelo V).Mas afinal, existe metodologia certa para se trabalhar?Vem comigo que vou te explicar o conceito das metodologias e te mostrar que a colaboração de um time, independente da metodologia escolhida, pode ter uma grande influência no resultado final.Como mencionado acima existem dois modelos bastantes conhecidos de Desenvolvimento de Software são eles:  Modelo Tradicional: Tem etapas bem definidas sendo o planejamento do projeto, uma estimativa em termos de prazo, orçamento, execução e entrega final. Segue um modelo sequencial onde uma etapa é executada após a outra ser finalizada. É esperada que a execução do projeto seja feita exatamente como foi planejada e para se ter sucesso a entrega deve ser feita dentro do prazo, orçamento e qualidade esperada.Modelo Ágil: É um modelo onde se pode “quebrar” o projeto em partes menores, ou seja, em pequenos entregáveis. Nessa metodologia você faz entregas constantemente até finalizar todo o projeto. Existe a preocupação com custo, qualidade e prazos. Porém, é possível controlar e gerenciar as mudanças que provavelmente irão aparecer. O planejamento dessa metodologia é de forma iterativa e incremental, ou seja, uma forma de progresso dentro do desenvolvimento do software.Podemos observar que existe bastante diferença entre os modelos. E a forma de escolha de cada um depende muito do cenário envolvido. Mas se olharmos bem, identificamos um ponto em comum: a comunicação.O compartilhamento da informação é um dos pontos principais para a melhoria da comunicação. O fato de não reter dados e compartilhar projetos e processos decisórios, por exemplo, faz com que os colaboradores se sintam integrados e partilhem do sentimento de união que toda boa equipe deve ter para formar um bom time.Vejamos um exemplo de um projeto cuja comunicação não foi boa:O projeto falhou em várias fases, tendo em vista que o balanço é uma representação abstrata do software. A análise do balanço é feita de forma completa no início do ciclo e diversos problemas ocorrem no decorrer do projeto para os envolvidos.Com esse exemplo podemos identificar que:Quando a comunicação é mal interpretada ou não é realizada, acabam-se criando barreiras no processo como:A mensagem é recebida apenas em parte;A mensagem é distorcida ou mal interpretada;A mensagem não é captada e a comunicação é interrompida.Ou seja, o típico e tão conhecido telefone sem fio.E é aqui que a Qualidade do Software começa a ser arruinadaA consequência um grande problema na qualidade do software, que ao invés de satisfazer as necessidades explícitas e implícitas acarreta em:Aumento do número de retrabalho;Software desenvolvido diferente do solicitado pelo cliente;Maior abertura de bugs;Estimativas inconsistentes;Perda de credibilidade interna;Atrasos nas entregas;Baixa qualidade de vida;Motivação.Tudo isto gera muitos problemas, não só para a organização, mas consequentemente, para os clientes, como por exemplo, insatisfação, baixa produtividade e perda do marketing empresarial.Conclusão:É essencial adotar uma metodologia, pois ela é de extrema importância não só para o sucesso no processo, mas principalmente, na entrega do produto. Mas antes de tudo é necessário amadurecer a ideia de comunicação dentro da organização por mais simples que você ache que possa ser, essa estratégia sempre vai gerar bons frutos. Todas as habilidades estão no time, independente do titulo do cargo e quando trabalhamos dividindo e compartilhando opiniões, estamos também aprendendo.Gratidão: Gabriel Santos, Paulo Oliveira, Vanessa Redes e Júlio de LimaReferências:Definição de comunicação: https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comunica%C3%A7%C3%A3oPara mais informações sobre as metodologias: https://www.devmedia.com.br/processo-de-teste-agil-x-tradicional/36854Problemas e prejuízos pelas falhas na comunicação:https://pmkb.com.br/artigos/problemas-e-prejuizos-pelas-falhas-de-comunicacao-entre-setores-da-engenharia/Revista TSPIConteúdo produzido por alunos do TSPI, o Treinamento de Testes de Software para IniciantesFollow67 Thanks to Paulo Oliveira and Gabriel Santos. ComunicaçãoQualidadeSoftware67 claps67 clapsWritten byJuliana SantanaFollowTest AnalystFollowRevista TSPIFollowConteúdo gratuito sobre Fundamentos, Abordagens, Técnicas, Ferramentas e Automação de Testes, de estudantes para estudantes.FollowWritten byJuliana SantanaFollowTest AnalystRevista TSPIFollowConteúdo gratuito sobre Fundamentos, Abordagens, Técnicas, Ferramentas e Automação de Testes, de estudantes para estudantes.More From MediumBoas práticas no report de bugsGabriel Santos in Revista TSPITestes Baseados em Riscos (Risk-Based Testing)Gabriel Santos in Revista TSPISoftware Testing HeuristicsKarla Silva in The StartupA Visual Tutorial on Every Type of Test You Can WriteArtur Basak in Better ProgrammingWriting Automated Acceptance Tests Using Serenity and the Screenplay PatternEdin Džanić in RUBICON StoriesCoverage vs. Effort in TestingNadeesha Cabral in Level Up CodingFunctional Programming Unit Testing in Node — Part 5: Noops, Stub Soup, and MountebankJesse WardenInherited Backend: BDD Integration TestingYapaxiLearn more.Medium is an open platform where 170 million readers come to find insightful and dynamic thinking."
"<strong class=""bt"">Scoring the Cloud — Perspectives and Approach</strong>",https://medium.com/@cloud_dude/scoring-the-cloud-perspectives-and-approach-9fcc77d52ebc?source=tag_archive---------2-----------------------,"SaaS,Cloud,Cloud Computing,Stocks,Software","Summary· I learned a lot from founding, growing, and exiting a successful SaaS business. I look at the universe of public cloud stocks differently than an analyst would.· I currently track a little over 150 public cloud software companies. I have found 6 factors help me select the highest quality from the public universe.· I share my philosophy and approach to select the best of the cloud.In my debut article on SeekingAlpha, I used my experience as a SaaS operator to analyze LinkedIn after its share price fell by 48%. Some were predicting it would decline an additional 80%. In the article, I drew on my experiences in building, growing, and (later) exiting my SaaS company to conclude that management of SaaS companies have tremendous operating leverage because they are actually running two companies — an “operating company” that is very profitable, and a “growth company” that invests in the future based on client lifetime values but which mask current profitability.This leverage allows the management team of a SaaS company the strategic option to quickly shift resources away from the growth company which consumes cash flow and capital, trading off some growth for a gain in profitability and leverage. My logic, using traditional profitability metrics and multiples from more mature enterprise software, concluded LinkedIn was undervalued by 30% and as much as 70%.At the time I wrote that article in February of 2016, LinkedIn was trading for $101 per share. Four months later, in June of 2016, Microsoft (MSFT) bought LinkedIn for $196 per share, a 96% increase from the date of the article.I’ve recently exited my SaaS company and have been developing my own personal portfolio of public and private SaaS. I’m putting the great investor Peter Lynch’s advice into practice by focusing on my circles of competency and invest in what I know.My actual returns have exceeded 15% for the previous 5 years, and 20% for the past three (time weighed return basis). The BVP Cloud Index has effectively doubled in the past 5 years from approximately 1,000 to 2,000 (approx. 14.8%) which means I’ve slightly beat the index.But I feel good about my returns because I’ve been cautious in my approach by avoiding poor companies that were overvalued and at times keeping large parts of my portfolio in cash. On a risk adjusted basis, I am confident I’m doing quite well against the benchmark. And, right now, my portfolio is now 50% in cash as I will not continue to chase the very high levels of valuation of the industry.I’m confident Mr. Market will provide me with an opportunity soon when there is a reversion to the mean and my fundamental screen will show me what gold there is among the carnage, just like he did in 2016, 2019, and again this year.Jamin Ball’s article on Q2 SaaS earnings covered the buildup in valuations quite well. To say that the top 5 median and overall medians are “frothy” is an understatement.Others have written about how we are still in the early innings of the cloud. I believe this to be true. But, I think there will be opportunity at better points of entry than we have now — much like the windows that opened in early 2016 (when I wrote the article mentioned above), again in late 2018 and late 2019, and in March of 2020 at the beginning of the Pandemic.To take advantage of times like those, one must have a quality list of stocks to buy and a price they are willing to pay.My philosophy in considering these public cloud stocks:1. These companies are inherently highly profitable and are more predictable than traditional software — Ultimately, these businesses are growing large and predictable recurring gross margin. Their sales and marketing, and to a smaller extent, their R&D, are invested in acquiring predictable gross margin. This continuous investment currently masks the inherent profitability of their operating company which is their flywheel.2. Markets currently reward growth — Growth is capital and cash intensive. Currently, markets reward managers who trade off present profitability for growth. But, the best of companies manage this tension within the “rule of 40” to maintain growth while capital markets demand it and while market share can be acquired. I’ll define “rule of 40” later but it illustrates the inherent tradeoff between growth and profitability. Even though profitability has become more important recently, growth is still the highest correlating factor with valuations.3. It’s much easier to trade-off growth for profitability than the inverse. This tradeoff can be achieved relatively quickly (i.e. 1–2 quarters). But it is exceedingly difficult to trade profitability for growth. Growth takes time to build much like it takes time and fuel for an airplane to gain in altitude.4. Gaap accounting rules hide the inherent profitability of SaaS — As an operator, I learned that SaaS companies defer much of their revenues into the future (oddly as a liability on their balance sheet) even though in most cases they’ve already collected the cash in advance of providing those services. Therefore, I look very closely at cash generation, billings (which can give a proxy for bookings which aren’t published by public SaaS), gross margins, and their efficiencies in acquiring future gross margin. To illustrate my point: In January 2020, Salesforce.com (CRM) reported a $10.6B deferred revenue liability on their balance sheet in a quarter where their revenues were approximately $17B. I would submit that most of their deferred revenue had already been collected as cash and was secured by contract. That cash was already at work in the business investing in future growth. I’m no accountant, but that doesn’t sound like a liability to me! So, I think gaap revenues actually obscure the underlying company fundamentals while acknowledging everyone needs a common set of accounting rules.My fundamental quantitative approach uses 6 factors to produce a weighted score which informs my top candidate list. I then look at price and value as well as other qualitative factors to determine relative valuations and whether I want to own the stock. I also use some crude intrinsic valuation measures (sourced DCF based valuations) which I’ve sourced. I think there is an opportunity for improvement by doing deeper modeling on disconted cash flow.This ultimately arms me with my “buy list” which contains the companies I want to own (and later, the price I’m willing to pay). The price I’m willing to pay is when I become convinced the company can grow 2–3 times its current value within 3–5 years using future traditional “mature” software metrics such as multiples on cash flow. If markets continue to value these companies in the future like they do today (based on multiples of revenue and growth rates), then this is upside for me and increases my margin of safety.My fundamental factors which I’ll elaborate on in future articles are:1. Gross Profit Acquisition (GPA) Efficiency — the measure of how efficient a company is with its usually very large investment in sales and marketing to acquire incremental gross profit.2. Rule of 40 — How well is a company managing the tradeoff between growth and profitability by measuring how they meet or exceed the rule of 40.3. Gross Margin — Ultimately these are machines. You feed them with investment in sales and marketing and what comes out is recurring high quality gross margin. In the future, when you pull back on investing in growth, this becomes a huge flywheel which generates profits and earnings. And good companies can leverage these customer relationships into up sales, expansions, and future business models. So, companies with less gross margins are less interesting to me unless they have a strong story for moving to the top of the class.4. Revenue Compound Annual Growth Rate — The one factor that mostly predicts enterprise value today is growth rate.5. Debt — Software companies are beginning to use debt as part of their capital structure. Debt can be both an accelerant and a drag on the company.6. Predictability — my computer models use historic revenue patterns and predict future revenue growth. Those companies that are the most predictable are more interesting to me because I believe that the market will punish those that become unpredictable — especially at current valuation levels.I rank each company on a 1–5 (worst to best) by sorting them into quintiles. I then weight each factor to produce a final score.My current top list of companies and their scores (best possible score is 50 points):1Q 2020 CloudDude ListI will cover of the 6 factors in future articles. I’ll also cover valuations. Hint: there are only 3 of the above that meet my personal margin of safety in terms of valuation.See the clouds adrift so far belowEver changing as they come and go;Makes me wonder why I’m up so highWhen really I am down so low— from Clouds, by BreadWritten byCloudDudeHusband, Dad, Entrepreneur, and Fisherman.

#100DaysOfCode Day 43: Agile Software Development,https://medium.com/cold-brew-code/100daysofcode-day-43-agile-software-development-28b442d201d9?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"Software Development,Programming,Software,Coding,Project Management","Flowchart of the Agile Software Development Method (number8.com)In software development, Agile approaches development requirements and solutions through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customers.It advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continual improvement, and it encourages flexible responses to change.Agile development was popularized by the Manifesto for Agile Software Development. The values and principles espoused in this manifesto were derived from and underpin a broad range of software development frameworks, including Scrum and Kanban.The Manifesto for Agile Software DevelopmentAgile Software Development ValuesBased on their combined experience of developing software and helping others do just that, the creators of The Manifesto for Agile Software Development proclaimed that they value:Individuals and interactions over processes and toolsTools and processes are important, but it is more important to have competent people working together effectively.2. Working software over comprehensive documentationGood documentation is useful in helping people understand how the software is built and how to use it. However, the main point of development is to create software, not write documentation.3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiationA contract is important, but it is no substitute for working closely with customers to discover what they need.4. Responding to change over following a planA project plan is important, but it must not be too rigid to accommodate changes in technology or the environment, stakeholder’s priorities, and people’s understanding of the problem and its solution.Agile Software Development PrinciplesThe Manifesto for Agile Software Development is based on twelve principles:Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software.Welcome changing requirements, even in late development.Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months)Close, daily cooperation between business people and developersProjects are built around motivated individuals who should be trustedFace-to-face conversation is the best form of communicationWorking software is the primary measure of progressSustainable development, able to maintain a constant paceContinuous attention to technical excellence and good designSimplicity, the art of maximizing the amount of work not done, is essentialBest architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teamsRegularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly.Overview of AgileIterative, Incremental, and EvolutionaryBreak product development work into small incrementsIterations (sprints) are short timeboxes lasting one to four weeksEach iteration involves cross-functional team working in all functions: planning, analysis, coding, unit testing, and acceptance testingA working product is demonstrated at the end of an iterationIterations minimize overall risk and allow the product to adapt to change quicklyAn iteration might not be enough to warrant a market release; might require several iterations to release a product.2. Efficient and face-to-face communicationCo-workers work at the same location to better establish team identity and improve communicationFace-to-face communication reduces the time taken for communicating in between mediaEach team should have a customer representative to review progress and re-evaluate priorities.3. Very short feedback loop and adaptation cycleDaily stand-up: team members report to each other their current progress and the goal of the day, along with any obstacles that others can help with.4. Quality focusSpecific tools are used to improve quality and enhance product development agility.Tools include:Continuous integrationAutomated unit testingPair programmingTest-driven developmentDesign patternsBehavior-driven developmentDomain-driven designCode refactoringPhilosophy of Agile Software DevelopmentAgile software development targets complex systems and product development with dynamic, non-deterministic, and non-linear characteristics. As estimates and stables plans are hard to get in the early stage, Agile development seeks to reduce the leap-of-faith that is needed before any evidence of value can be obtained.Adaptive vs. predictiveAgile development methods lie on the adaptive side of development. One key of adaptive development is a rolling wave approach to schedule planning, which identifies milestones but leaves flexibility in the path to reach them, and also allows for the milestones themselves to change. Adaptive methods focus on adapting quickly to changing realities.On the other hand, the predictive methods focus on analyzing and planning the future in detail and cater to known risks.Agile vs. WaterfallOne of the main differences between Agile and Waterfall development is its approach to quality and testing.In the Waterfall model, there is always a separate testing phase after a build phase; however, in Agile software development, testing is completed in the same iteration as programming.Another difference between Agile and Waterfall development is the presence of iterations. In the Waterfall software development method, a project goes through several Software Development Lifecycle phases; one phase is completed in its entirety before moving on to the next phase.On the other hand, because Agile development is done through iterations, and every testing is done in every iteration, small pieces of software can be pushed to the public and therefore have its value evaluated. Being able to create plans for progression in software every iteration allows the product to adapt to any change in the environment.This iterative approach follows the product mindset, instead of the project mindset. This provides greater flexibility throughout the development process; whereas, on a project mindset, the requirements are predefined and locked.Code vs. DocumentationCritics of the Agile labeled this software development method as “another reason for programmers to just code without writing good documentation”. However, proponents of the Agile Development Method stated how too much documentation isn’t a good thing, as it is usually out of sync with the actual code, while too little of documentation is also a bad thing. The proposition they placed was just enough documentation.Experience and AdoptionAlthough the Agile Software Development method can be used with any programming language in practice, it was originally closely associated with Object-Oriented Programming environments such as Lisp and Java.The early adopters of Agile methods were usually small to medium-sized teams working on unprecedented systems with requirements that were difficult to finalize and likely to change as the system was being developed.Common Agile Software Development PitfallsPitfalls while using Agile are usually termed agile anti-patterns or agile smells. Some common examples of these pitfalls are:Lack of overall product designThe goal of the Agile software development method is to work on producing software and less on documentation. This is in contrast with the Waterfall method, where any small changes in the code should also come with revisions to the documentation. In this case, failure to pay attention to design can cause a team to proceed rapidly without any proper documentation of design, which could lead to serious rework when they attempt to scale up the system.Adding stories to an iteration in progressIn Agile software development, stories are typically used to define requirements and an iteration is a short period of time during which the team commits to specific goals. Adding stories to an iteration in progress is detrimental to a good flow of work. These should be added to the product backlog and prioritized for a subsequent iteration or in rare cases the iteration should be canceled.If a new story appears that requires a change of an iteration, the team must then deal with the new information, which may produce additional tasks for a story. This new information should then be prioritized against all remaining stories, as the new information may have changed the story’s original priority.Product owner role is not properly filledThe product owner role is usually someone from the business side of things. The mistake made in Agile software development is when the Product owner comes from the Development side of the operation. In this case, the Product owner will make decisions without any real feedback from the business perspective. This could also lead to distraction as the Product owner needs to reach out to the outside team for direction.Teams are not focusedAgile software development requires teams to meet product commitments, which means they should focus only on work for that product. However, when a member of the team has spare capacity, this member is expected to help work on other work, which ultimately reduces the focus for their committed work.Excessive preparation/planningPeople who are less familiar with Agile software development are often victim of excessive planning. The team feels obliged to have a complete understanding and specification of all stories.The proper way is to move forward with stories that they are confident in working, and then during the iteration, continue to discover new stories to work on for subsequent iterations.Problem-solving in the daily standupDaily stand-up meetings should not take too much time, as its goal is to create a focused, timely meeting where all team members disseminate information. If a part of the team gets stuck on solving a certain problem, then this will be a waste of time for other teams. It is best to leave the problem solving after the daily standup, where subteams can come together and take the time to work on it.Allowing technical debt to build-upFocusing on continuously creating new iterations might create technical debt. The team must allow themselves time for defect remediation and refactoring. Technical debt hinders planning abilities by increasing the amount of unscheduled work as production defects distract the team from further progress.Cold Brew CodeBrewing Code EverydayFollow1 Software DevelopmentProgrammingSoftwareCodingProject Management1 clap1 clapWritten byRichard RussellFollowi like to write about code. i also like cold brew coffee.FollowCold Brew CodeFollowRichard Russell’s Personal Coding BlogFollowWritten byRichard RussellFollowi like to write about code. i also like cold brew coffee.Cold Brew CodeFollowRichard Russell’s Personal Coding BlogMore From MediumHow To Make Your PHP Code Beautiful With Chainable MethodsChris Geelhoed in Better ProgrammingFourier Transformer Epicycle Image Tracer and Its MathematicsVicky KumarWhat’s New in Laravel 8?Natalie Mclaren in Better ProgrammingHow Serverless Can Impact Your BusinessAphinya Dechalert in mad<hashmap>Kafka Stretch ClustersSonam VermaniStatic Typing vs. Dynamic TypingSome Dude Says in The StartupThe most common mistakes of ETL developersMkrtich Pudeian in Data Analyst BlogDeploying Citrix API gateway using Rancher | Citrix BlogsTejas KonduriLearn more.Medium is an open platform where 170 million readers come to find insightful and dynamic thinking."
Middleware In .NET Core,https://medium.com/@muhammedalibalci/middleware-in-net-core-a4448e74af17?source=tag_archive---------4-----------------------,"Aspnetcore,Programming,Software,Software Development,C Sharp Programming","In this article, I am going to explain what middleware is and how to create a middleware yourself.What is middleware?Middleware is a system that provides to deal with the https request-response pipeline. This system has a feature that can request to the next pipeline. Thus, you can have a chance to handle middleware. Data management, application services, messaging, authentication, and API management are all commonly handled by middleware.Asp.Net Core MiddlewareWe can think of each middleware as a class. Each request that is coming to our app passes through middleware in order. We can determine our middleware in Configure method of Startup.cs class or we can handle default middleware there. We can see some middlewares that were written in Configure below.Middleware structureFor example, Routing uses a pair of middleware, registered by UseRouting and UseEndpoints:UseRouting adds route matching to the middleware pipeline. This middleware looks at the set of endpoints defined in the app, and selects the best match based on the request.UseEndpoints adds endpoint execution to the middleware pipeline. It runs the delegate associated with the selected endpoint.(taken from: Microsoft)This method accepts an IApplicationBuilder parameter. IApplicationBuilder is an interface that the mechanisms provide to configure an application’s request pipeline.Let’s started.Firstly, our scenario is that we are going to control a secret key in the header of the request that is coming to our app. If this secret key is true, we will return a response according to that.I am going to create a class called HeaderCheckMiddleware. Then, this class needs a parameter, called RequestDelegate, which provides us to handle the request.When a request comes to a middleware, Invoke function starts to run. We can reach the information of request-response with HttpContext. Thus, we can check if an available secret key or not in the header.If the secret key is empty or null, it will return 400(Bad Request). If the secret is wrong, it will return 401(Unauthorized).We provide that middleware pass to another middleware in 48 lines. We have finished our work in this class.Now, we should define this middleware in the app. I mentioned that middleware is defined in Startup.cs. Let’s look at how to configure there.We enable the middleware in Configure function.app.UseMiddleware<HeaderCheckMiddleware>();We can test this middleware by using Postman.If we don’t send expected data in the header, we will face this error.empty secret-keyIf we send invalid a secret key in the header, it will return 401(Unauthorized).invalid secret keyIf we send a valid secret key in the header, data will have come properly.valid secret-keyWe created easily a basic middleware. I hope this article will help you to understand a bit about Middleware in .Net Core.Happy Coding !Thank YouReferencesASP.NET Core Middleware: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/middlewareWrite custom ASP.NET Core middleware: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/middleware/writeWritten byMuhammed Ali BalcıSoftware DeveloperFollow10 10 10 AspnetcoreProgrammingSoftwareSoftware DevelopmentC Sharp ProgrammingMore from Muhammed Ali BalcıFollowSoftware DeveloperMore From MediumHow To Pick The Right Tech Stack For Your Web ApplicationBailey KeeferPlaying with Raspberry Pi and Python: Traffic LightsSimon Prickett in Conectric NetworksHow we migrated our data warehouse from Redshift to BigQueryRahul Jain in Omio EngineeringAWS API Gateway — Integrate Environments to Different Versions of the Same Lambda FunctionSatish Gadhave in The StartupHow do you REALLY pronounce kubectl?Keri Savoca in Diary of an SREHiding an element when there is no enough space — Thanos snap techniqueRaghavan SKUsing AWS Lambda to Scale Image ProcessingPuneeth S in Better ProgrammingInstalling Kubeflow on macOS with MicroK8sDan Siwiec in Dan On CodingAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
How JavaScript is ruling the Software Industry,https://medium.com/@shyammohandccs/how-javascript-is-ruling-the-software-industry-70653c3165b5?source=tag_archive---------5-----------------------,"JavaScript,Software,Industry,React,Angular","Photo by Tracy Adams on UnsplashJavaScript is one of the most famous languages polished over a period of time.Programming Language Popularity Over TimeBack in the day, JavaScript was primarily focused to use as a front-end scripting language. In 1990 The First web Browser was developed by Tim Berner Lee and after 4 years, people are actually acknowledging about what is the Internet and how the giant interconnection networking works.And then the Internet Browser was born. At the very first stage, WorldWideWeb(developed by Tim Berner Lee) came into existence and then Netscape. In between the development, Browsers like Nexus and Mosaic were prior to Netscape, but the development of GUI and other fixes are done under Netscape 1.0 and further with Microsoft browser and Chrome.source -InternetOkay moving back to JavaScript, It was first called LiveScript and then JavaScript in September 1995 and yes it is not similar to JAVA.JAVA and JavaScript are two different things like Car and Carpet.JavaScript is used to develop and build interactive web pages, games, apps, surveys, interacting with the server(NodeJS), saving data into the databases(MongoDB), and a whole lot more..!How Industry is rapidly changing with JavaScript?source — giphyThe website that was made 10 years back is different from today. The website that is made today is dynamically capable of handling more than a thousand requests per second and executing and saving data in a convenient way. The Info-website is changed to the Dynamic one.With rich developer support and a fast-moving community, JavaScript evolved very Quick.Two of the most famous framework i.e ReactJS and AngularJS is dominating till today’s date.ReactJS is supported by FACEBOOK and AngularJS is backed by Google. Other lite framework is also in the market like vueJS,electronJS, etc.Websites like Facebook, HackerRank are already using ReactJS and many other startup companies prefer their first choice as ReactJS also it’s community is growing at full tilt but does that mean AngularJS is not good enough..? Absolutely not :-DReactJS and AngularJS can be used as per the software requirement and the user perspective view i.e how they consume. Angular has all the third party support, routes, etc while React depends on some, but that does not affect the production end.Also, there is famous stack both for ReactJS and AngularJS used for making a full-fledged(front to backend) Application using Javascript, They are :MERN(MongoDB, Express. js, React, and Node. js)MEAN(MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, and Node. js)Conclusion:Javascript is still in demand even today. There are lots of possibilities by just learning Javascript and their frameworks, we can open the door of jobs, creating our own business, and more. Also, We can use machine learning in JS by using TensorFlow to train our model and work accordingly. So as I tell lots of opportunities are already discovered and are unlocking lots of doors.

OVERLAPS for Microsoft LAPS Version 3.0,https://medium.com/@mestacey/overlaps-for-microsoft-laps-version-3-0-f75b95b2a8df?source=tag_archive---------6-----------------------,"Security,Microsoft,Passwords,Software,It Support","Today we will be releasing update 3.0.0.0 of OVERLAPS, our popular web interface for controlling Microsoft LAPS managed Local Administrator passwords. Below we’ll highlight the biggest changes coming with this version, or scroll to the bottom for the full change notes.Main FeaturesComputer ManagementWe’ve added a new computer management system, starting with two simple tools: Ping and Group Policy Update.Since expiring a password in OVERLAPS doesn’t actually cause the computer to change its password, we wanted to provide a way to force this by granting the ability to trigger a remote Group Policy update. However, since we have other ideas to make OVERLAPS even more effective, we decided to implement this as a Computer Management engine within OVERLAPS.To start with only two tools are included: an ICMP Ping for checking whether a in-network computer is online or not (and getting its IP address), and a Group Policy update tool which utilises WMI to trigger the update on a remote computer (this requires WMI to be enabled and configured to allow the OVERLAPS server permission to run this task).Additional LanguagesAfter adding the option for US English in OVERLAPS recently, we have now added an additional 4 languages: French (fr-FR), German (de-DE), Italian (it-IT) and Spanish (es-ES).Note that these are machine translations provided by DeepL, so we do expect there to be one or two minor mistranslations. Please report any such mistakes to us ( support@int64software.com) and we will correct them.Additional Notification RecipientsYou can now enter additional email addresses when creating Notifications (for when passwords are read or expired).For security reasons, the domain of these email addresses can be limited from the Configuration page.And more…Continue reading for the full list of changes in this release, or head over to the Downloads page to access the update.Full Change NotesComputer List and PasswordsAdded the ability to specify expiry date/time when expiring passwords. This can either be enabled globally for all users with the Expire Passwords permission or per-user via their User Access Levels. This cannot currently be enabled for users who need to submit Access Requests to expire passwords though.Added a computer information modal for viewing additional information about a computer’s Active Directory properties. A new per-container permission has been added to allow users to view this.Added the ability to edit the description of a computer object in Active Directory. The OVERLAPS server must have the “Write Description” permission in AD. A new per-container permission has been added for this ability.Added the ability to enter one or more alternative email addresses when creating a notification (so it can go to a distribution group for example). By default, to prevent abuse, the addresses are limited to known domains (current domain, other domains in the forest, and domains in other trusted forests), this can be configured from the Email Settings page.Added the computer control buttons (bottom of the computer list) to the top of the page as well for easier access.Fixed issues with the computer select checkboxes not working for some search results.Reworked computer search feature to resolve an issue with the sorting mechanic.Updated container permissions so that anyone with a valid permission to a container can now view the computers in that container. So users don’t need permission to read computer passwords if they just need access to the computer’s information, or to run a ping on it.Added missing notification when a Authorisation Request for a computer password reset is authorised.Computer ManagementAdded Computer Management capability including separate per-container permissions and Management page for viewing the results of your recent Management tasks. Each tool must be manually enabled from the Site Settings page.Added a Computer Management task to ping computers from OVERLAPSAdded a Computer Management task to run a remote Group Policy update on computers from OVERLAPS. This requires WMI to be configured on clients and the OVERLAPS server to have permission to use it (see the Administrator’s Guide for more information).User ManagementAdded a tool for bulk importing Self Service users and their computers from a CSV file.Add ability to enforce Two Factor Authentication, when enabled users will be prompted to scan a QR code and then enter the code from their authenticator app before they can proceed.Changed the LDAP and Directory Searcher so that when searching for a new domain user to add to OVERLAPS they will now also search by Display Name as well as the sAMAccountName as was the previous behaviour. To avoid creating duplicate queries, the Principal search has not currently been updated to do the same.Changed Add User handling so that if the auto-suggest is unable to find the user in Active Directory, it will now attempt to use the entered username to find the user instead.Self ServiceAdded Authorisation System to Self Service users, now each computer can be tagged to require a nominated authorisor for that AD container to authorise a request before the user can access the password. A new permission “Authorise Self Service” has been added to accommodate this.Applied Rate Limits to Self Service usersFixed an issue when saving the Self Service settings for a user without adding any computers (just setting the Managed By property).Fixed an issue where Self Service users may still have seen the “Browser” button in their menu, which would then show an error if used because they don’t have permission to access any containers.User ProfileAdded a list of notifications the current user is subscribed to to the Profile page with ability to remove them.LanguageAdded German, French, Spanish and Italian machine translations (provided by DeepL). More languages to follow.ConfigurationFixed a bug when saving Auto Reset values which was failing the valid values validation process.Added the ability to search the configuration file in the Configuration UtilityAdded the ability to unbind certificates from the Configuration Utilty when there is one already bound to the selected hostname / IP addressAdded certificate store option to Configuration Utility to fix a problem where official third-party certificates (e.g. Thawte, LetsEncrypt, etc) need importing into Trusted Root Certification Authorities whereas Self Signed certificates need to go into the Personal store.Added the ability to give Organizational Units an alternative Display Name. This allows you to give containers friendlier designations for end users.Fixed an issue where it wasn’t possible to grant group members permissions to containers individually.SystemUnified page handling for login and two-factor authentication entry pagesChanged default behaviour so that the webhost will failover to a wildcard binding in rare cases where no IP addresses can be found on the server. As this presents a possible surface of attack, administrators will receive a warning about this on the Host settings screen advising them to set the IP address manually.Fixed a main menu display issue on small screen devicesAdded the LAPS Active Directory Checker tool (“lapscheck.exe”) for scanning a particular OU or computer object to test their LAPS relevant permissions and access to the LAPS properties. This can be passed a username and password for checking different accounts, or use the “lapscheck_system.exe” tool to run it as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM to simulate OVERLAPS’s default setup. See lapscheck.readme.txt for more information.Added support for LDAP and Security Principals for computer operations (on top of existing Directory Searcher) for increased compatibility across environments.Changed user authentication over to using the defined primary/fallback methods as used by other user queriesOriginally published at https://int64software.com on August 1, 2020.Written byMatt StaceyManaging Director of Int64 Software Ltd, developers of IT Service Desk software, network security tools, and custom intranet solutions.FollowSecurityMicrosoftPasswordsSoftwareIt SupportMore from Matt StaceyFollowManaging Director of Int64 Software Ltd, developers of IT Service Desk software, network security tools, and custom intranet solutions.More From MediumWe Need To Get Better At Security!Prof Bill Buchanan OBE in ASecuritySite: When Bob Met AliceQuantum Robust Hash-based SignaturesProf Bill Buchanan OBE in CoinmonksCompliance, Cybersecurity, & Reliable OperationTiffany Aliano in The StartupHow to Prevent MFA Bypass in Mobile AppsAlanB in The StartupWhy Do Otherwise Smart People Fall For Obvious Scams and Hoaxes?Brett ChristensenFake French Police Sextortion ScamSucuri Security in The StartupThe Ultimate Checklist on Ways to Prevent IoT Data CompromiseReadWrite in ReadWriteThe Future of Cyber Security, Data and AI: Big Brother or a Brave New World?Prof Bill Buchanan OBE in ASecuritySite: When Bob Met AliceAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Basics: Tools across the Business Intelligence process,https://medium.com/@BI_Impulse/basics-tools-across-the-business-intelligence-process-e72227a414b3?source=tag_archive---------7-----------------------,"Data,Business Intelligence,Data Science,Software,Analytics","“Accept yourself, your strengths, your weaknesses, your truths, and know what tools you have to fulfill your purpose.” — Steve MaraboliIt is now a well-known fact and a popular opinion that Data based content is making headlines and one can come across numerous resources with a simple Google search. All this for a reason that the rate of data generation is “too damn high”. A very comprehensive and appealing info-graphic hosted on Visualcapitalist.com, shows the enormous amount of data that is generated per day. Now when it comes to analyzing through a fraction of this high amount of data, Software based tools come handy and provide us quick insights that the human eye and brain can’t catch by looking at the raw numbers or data pointers.We have already established the “The Business Intelligence Process” and its various stages. Fortunately, the choice of tools we use across this process, also highly depends on how well a specific tool (out of the several hundred available ones) fairs across a specific stage in the process. Just for a recap, the tools, which are widely used in the BI industry depends on their usability in following stages:1. Dashboarding / Visualizing / Reporting2. Extraction Transformation and Loading (ETL)3. Data Staging and Cleaning4. Predictive AnalyticsIn this article, we will look at two or three most popular tools out of the several available ones that can serve the above functionalities. Please note that this post by no means is a recommendation guide. There are several good tools out there and new ones are entering marketplace every few days. Since it is not possible to cover every one of those, this article will provide you with a direction that what exactly can you look for in a tool while building your own BI portfolio.Dashboarding / Visualizing / Reporting + Predictive AnalyticsAt this stage, the tools that can provide a wide variety of Visuals to deal with different datatypes, ranging from Numerical to Geographical data. The tool should be user friendly and intuitive, so that the users can generate and experiment with visuals and customize them according to the needs. While the built dashboards can be used for metric tracking, tools with some aspects of Predictive Analytics have an edge in market. Few widely used tools are:TableauTableau is one of the most widely sought-after tools in the BI industry with a good number of capabilities integrated. This tool is highly intuitive that even non-technical users can load datasets and experiment within the tool to generate interactive visualizations and dashboards. Tableau also have dedicated features to generate Linear Regression models for forecasting in data models.Microsoft Power BIOne of the top-rated tools when it comes to BI process, Power BI allows the users to connect to a wide number of data sources and create appealing visuals. Power BI also provides a lot of additional features such as Mobile View integration and per visual data extraction, which makes it a powerful Data Visualization tool. Power BI has introduced a KPI influence visual, which is AI based. This feature can be easily used by users to track Data Fields in current model to predict their influence on specific metrics.Extraction Transformation and Loading (ETL) + Data CleaningWe have covered the need of ETL in “The Business Intelligence Process”. In short, ETL allows to bring together data from various data sources to finally load into a Visualization tool. Some popular ETL tools are:Azure Data FactoryMicrosoft Azure Data Factory provides great ETL functionality for users of all technical and skill levels. Users can clean datasets and create their own ETL flow using a code-free approach. Azure Data Factory has a high number of data connectors, which makes it a good choice of users trying to build an ETL process.AlteryxAlteryx specializes in self-service analytics with an intuitive user interface. Alteryx can work with multiple data sources and perform complex operations, including predictive, spatial, statistical analytics to obtain clean datasets. It’s a highly developed tool and usually the first preference in BI industry to build an ETL flow.BONUS: My PortfolioThough it is always a great idea to have a diverse portfolio, it is also preferred to be dab hand at certain tools. You can iterate through a wide selection of available tools to find your fit just like I did when I started exploring this domain. For me, the portfolio choice comprises of Microsoft Power BI and Azure Data Factory. Primary reason behind Power BI being the Data Analytics eXpression (DAX) code that you can write in Power BI application itself to build and manipulate datasets to create measure. For Azure Data Factory, it provides seamless integration with Power BI services to load staged data after the ETL flow. Moreover, building the ETL flow using a code-free approach always comes handy. Pairing this combination with basic querying knowledge in SQL has given me good value while building my reports.Now having a basic understanding of what you might want to find in a tool of your choice, I wish you all the best for your hunt to find your perfect fit to help you support your BI journey ahead.

Developing a Microservice to Handle Over 30k Requests Per Second at Ifood,https://medium.com/swlh/developing-a-microservice-to-handle-over-30k-requests-per-second-at-ifood-3e2d7b822b0e?source=tag_archive---------10-----------------------,"Programming,Scale,Kubernetes,Software Development,Software Architecture","Photo by Isaac Smith on UnsplashIfood it’s a Brazilian food tech company delivering more than 1 million orders per day and growing around 110% every year. As a food tech, the platform peeks hours are mostly around lunch and dinner and it gets even higher during the weekends.On some special days (eg: due to marketing campaigns) we beat the last record and see the platform getting as its highest peek of all times. Last June 12th was that day. We saw a microservice reach 2MM requests per minute.Some background storyI’ve been working in the Account & Identity team in the Platform Engineering area in Ifood for around one and a half years. It’s been quite a journey and from time to time we face a lot of challenges due to the fast-growing of the company. When designing new solutions we always have to keep in mind the idea that in a couple of months that the system use will grow 2 or 3 times.The story I’m gonna tell today is an example of the case above. The system was developed around 2018 when the company was delivering 13 million orders per month. Nowadays, it’s over 30 million. That’s not always true, but in this case, the system usage has grown with the same proportion of the company grow, and later on it started to grow even more aggressively.Internally we call this microservice as account-metadata. Even though it’s kind of a generic name it also explains what’s the service is up to: it deals with the accounts’ metadata. What is account metadata? Well, mostly what’s not a main/basic customer information. To give you some examples: if the user prefers to get notifications via SMS or email, the favorite food types (like burger, pasta, Japanese food, etc), some feature flags, number of orders done for that user and so on. It’s like a commonplace to aggregate data from different places and to be served easily to the mobile app, but also to other microservices so they just need to call one microservice instead of ten.Back in 2018, account-metadata was built mainly to put some random (and not so used) information that, to be honest, there was no other place to put them. We needed a bit of structure and query power and it should be easy to scale it, so we pick the provisioned DynamoDB by AWS. Just to make it clear here, that, we’re aware that the system could grow, also the company was quite big already and the average load was challenging. However, there was no way we could figure out that we would go from 10k requests per minute (rpm) to 200k and then to 2MM rpm.After the first release of this microservice, there was not much usage (compared to other microservices in the Account & Identity team). However, a few weeks later and some business decisions made, the system became very important and it would be one of the first calls that the mobile app would do to get all that info about the customer.Few months after that decision, other teams started to see the account-metadata as a nice place to put info that was split into multiple places and that was hard to relly on. Also, we started to create more aggregations that would make the life of other microservices really easier, increasing the importance of the system and that’s just spread its popularity and importance inside other teams. Now, account-metadata is called every time a user opens the app and by many teams in very different contexts.And that’s a very, very short summary of what happened and how the system became so important from 2018 until now. During this period, the team (me plus eight really brilliant people that I’m very lucky to work with) actively worked on it, but not exclusively. We’re still patching, developing, and maintaining the other ten microservices that we own.We did a bunch of changes and to describe all the scenarios that we went through would take too much time, so I’m writing bellow the current architecture that we have to be able to healthy deliver 2 MM requests per minute. Finally, it’s time to dive into the technical part.Diving into the technical partAs I said, this microservice stores metadata about the customer. In the database, we split this metadata into different contexts (or as we called in the code: namespaces). A customer (customer_id as a partition key) can have one to N namespaces (as the sorting key) and each one has a fixed and rigid schema that is defined and checked (before insert) by a jsonschema. With that, we can make sure that however will insert data into a namespace (more details on this later on) will respect its schema and its right usage.We used this approach because the read and write on this system are done by really different areas of the company.The insert is done by the data science team as they daily export millions of records from their internal tools to this microservice calling it via an API splitting these millions of records into batches of ~ 500 items. So, a given time of the day this microservice receives millions of calls (in an interval of 10 to 20 minutes) to insert data into the DynamoDB. If the batch API that receives the ~ 500 items would write them directly into the database, we could have some problems to scale Dynamo, and also it could be hard to keep a slow response time. A way to fix this bottleneck would be the data team writing their data directly into the database, however, we must check if the items respect the jsonschema defined to the namespace that it will be stored and that’s a responsibility of the microservice.So the solution was that this API would receive the batch of items and post them on an SNS/SQS that will be consumed by another part of the application that then will validate the item and if it’s ok, save it on Dynamo. With this approach, the endpoint that receives the batch of items can answer really fast and we can make the write without relying on the HTTP connection (this is quite important because the communication with Dynamo may fail and try it again could make the HTTP response time really slow). Another benefit is that we can control how fast/slow we want to read the data from SQS and write it on Dynamo by controlling the consumers.Outside of this workflow, the account-metadata is also called by another service that call it every time that an order is received by the platform, to update some information regarding that order. Given that Ifood does more than 1MM orders per day, the microservices also receive that amount of calls.While there’s some very heavy write process on it, 95% of its load comes from API calls to read data. As I said, the write and data are done from very different teams, and the read calls are done by many, many teams, and mobile apps. For our luck, this microservice is much more requested to read data than to write it, so it’s a little bit easier to scale it. As any system that reads a lot of data needs a cache, so does this and instead of using Redis or something like that, AWS provides DAX as “kinda built-in” cache for DynamoDB. To use it you just need to change the client and understand the replication delay that may happen in the different queries operations.With this amount of calls, it’s quite normal that we get some irregularity. In our case, we started to see some queries in Dynamo taking longer than 2 or 3 seconds, when 99.99% of the calls were under 17ms. Even though they’re just a few thousand per day, we would like to provide a better SLA for the teams. So, we decied to do a retry if we got a timeout from Dynamo. We also talked with teams so they configure a low timeout when calling our APIs. The default for most of their HTTP client was 2s, so we changed to ~100ms. If they get a timeout (let’s say that the microservice did a retry to dynamo but failed again) they can retry and very likely they will get a response.To deploy it, we’re using k8s (reaching around 70 pods) and scaling it as the requests per second grow. The DynamoDB is set as provisioned instead of on-demand.An important step to make sure that the system would be able to healthy work in cases really high throughput, we run a load/stress test against it every day, to make sure that the deploys from the day above did not degrade the performance and that things are still ok and working well. With the results of this load test, we could keep track if an endpoint was getting better or worse with time and development of it.With time, this microservice became quite important for some teams and that’s a problem if, by any reason, the system goes down. To fix that, we ask the teams to call the microservice via Kong (our API gateway) and configured a fallback there. So, if the microservice goes down or returns a 500, Kong will activate the fallback and the client will get an answer. The fallback in this case is a S3 bucket with a copy of the data that the system would provide. It may be outdate, but that’s better than do not have an answer at all.And that’s, in summary, how it works. There is also some other workflows on it, but nothing as relevant as the ones that I’ve said.The next steps are still not very clear for the team. The usage of the microservice may grow even more and we could reach a point where it starts to became harder and harder to make it scalle. An alternative could be to split it into different microservices (maybe even with different databases) or aggregate more the data to better serve them. In any case we will still keep doing tests, finding the bottlenecks and trying to fix them.The StartupMedium's largest active publication, followed by +723K people.

12 Ways to Add an Array of Integers in C# — Part 3: Thinking in Sets,https://medium.com/dev-genius/12-ways-to-add-an-array-of-integers-in-c-part-3-thinking-in-sets-e2f456454f88?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"Programming,Software Development,Software,Software Engineering,Coding","If we were to do the array-summing exercise we’ve been talking about in JavaScript rather than C#, how many solutions could we come up with? Obviously the for loop solution from Part 1 would work in JavaScript.Of course, the two related solutions from that article, using goto and pointers, would not work. JavaScript has labels but they can’t be used for this kind of thing. And if JavaScript had access to pointers, the Internet probably wouldn’t have survived the 90s.The “foreach” solution from Part 2 would also work pretty much the same, using for..of.And it would probably be pretty easy to come up with an iterator-based solution as well, similar to the one in that article.As you may already be thinking, the for..of construct in JavaScript can be simplified.Let’s break this down a little bit. Why does values have a forEach method available to it? Because at runtime, values (we assume) will contain an array. Modern JavaScript has quite an impressive set of methods available for processing arrays. In fact, we can simplify this example even a little further using another array method.One-liners FTW!You can actually do a lot of awesome things with reduce, including some really clever things that will make your code unintelligible to the next person to look at it, which might be you six months from now, so be careful! But this kind of use exactly fits the purpose of reduce, namely, to take a set of things and reduce them to a single instance of that same thing. The parameters are an “accumulator” (which you can initialize to a specific value if needed) and a “current” value. The function body just describes how to combine the “current” value with the “accumulator”, in this case by adding the two together.AggregateModern C# also has a pretty impressive array of methods available for processing sets (see what I did there?). I mentioned in the previous article that the IEnumerable interface was an important concept in C#. The reason? Anything that implements IEnumerable has access to all the extension methods available in the Enumerable class. And that is quite a list!In fact, one of those methods is .NET’s version of array.reduce, called Aggregate.Eerily similar to the JavaScript version, huh? And just like reduce in JavaScript, Aggregate can be used for all kinds of good and evil purposes. Anytime you’ve got an “IEnumerable” of things — numbers, strings, dates, Widgets, whatever — you can use Aggregate to turn that vector into a scalar, to turn that multitude into an individual, to combine some or all of those parts into a whole, using whatever transformation logic applies.SumBy comparison, the lowly Sum method seems pretty weak. Aggregate can take just about any kind of collection of objects and do just about anything to them; Sum can only take numbers, and all it knows how to do is add them. Lame!I spent some time in Part 1 talking about how I like to use this as a coding exercise for interviewing programmers. Like I said there, most people come up with the for loop. But special points for the handful who instinctively come up with this solution:Why is this my favorite real-world solution? Because it’s three letters and a little punctuation, and then you move on to solving some actual business problems. If something breaks later on, it’s almost certainly not in this code. You write this one-liner and never have to think about it again.But can we count on this to perform as well as a hand-crafted integer-adding algorithm? Probably, maybe, who knows? Probably 99.99% of the time it won’t make any difference. Maybe there’s something unique or unusual about your set of integers (cardinality? distribution? ???) that can be optimized using some other approach. And maybe your integer-adding problem is demonstrably the long pole in a performance-critical section of code. Fine, do you what you need to do. But before I implement anything more complicated, I’m going to do the simple thing first and then measure it to prove that the simple approach won’t work.Either way, a developer who can turn eight lines of code (the for solution, counting the braces) into a single, highly readable line is, in my estimation, likely to be a developer who will move your codebase in a good direction.And a developer who can seamlessly pivot from thinking of a procedure to be performed multiple times in a loop — what we’ve been doing since the days of Cobol and RPG— to thinking in terms of a functional transformation to be applied to a set of like terms, well, that’s probably going to be a developer who will move your team in a good direction.On the other hand, a developer whose first instinct is “I bet I could write a recursive method to do that” is at least going to be an interesting interview. Yet, while it might not be the best approach for this solution, recursion is still a valuable concept for a programmer to understand. We’ll explore some recursive solutions next time.Dev GeniusCoding, Tutorials, News, UX, UI and much more related to developmentFollow20 Sign up for Best StoriesBy Dev GeniusThe best stories sent monthly to your email. Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

It actually creates the entire ebook full of content in minutes.In a Rush? Download Sqribble now >>Ebook DefinitionNow you already know that ebooks are electronic books. But the ebook is a very broad term and covers a lot of other sub-terms in itself. Ebook is also known asLead magnetsWhitepapersBlueprintsGuidesCheatsheetsReportsPdfSo you get the idea that Ebook is a very broad term. But the good thing is you can create all of this using Sqribble.The CreatorThe creator of this brilliant application is named “Adeel Chowdhry”. He is a very renowned online entrepreneur. He has over 10 years of experience in this industry with more than a couple of awards under his belt.In this digital industry, he has made over 8 figure revenue till now.

If you are marketing online, ebooks are a staple component of that. To prosper, you have to use Ebooks for your company.Sqribble will make efficient ebooks that will be essential for your sale funnels.If you are going to make a list, you will have to implement ebooks. There is no other good way to sell informational products or online courses without the aid of well-made ebooks.For a product to sell and get good reviews from a customer, you will be needing an instruction manual. And to make that you will need ebooks.Different kinds of coaching and guides like, educational guides, training guides are made from ebooks. Even every book publishing gig requires an ebook. If you want to become an author, you will need ebooks.So the bottom line is if you want to prosper, make good sales, and earn a substantial amount of profit then ebooks are very much essential.And all of this can be accomplished by Sqribble by mere seconds.Problems That Sqribble SolvesCreating ebooks is a massive problem. Because they are actually hard to create. You may have heard from a friend or a colleague that they are easy to make, But the actual truth is they are not. They are far from being easy.The second big problem is the time consumption. Creating an ebook can take weeks, sometimes even months. A decent one takes more time. Just a report has a content of 30 to 50 long pages. So creating just a free report is time-consuming, let alone an actual ebook.It takes so much time because you had to spend a lot of it on research and planning.Even after you are done with that part, there is always proper writing and editing.Then you will have to find the right idea of design and the formatting that perfectly suits the content. As design plays a big factor in the quality of the ebook, it a very hard job to do.If you don’t know how to design then that will create big problems also. Because no one wants to read an ebook that looks very basic and old fashioned. So the problem of not knowing how to properly design is a big factor also.I think you know it already that, there are some software out there on the market that costs hundreds of dollars. Some even up to a thousand dollars that formats and designs your ebook properly.The most common problem other than this is a writers’ block. Most people are not gifted writers. So when to start on an empty page, they get overwhelmed and think about where to even start. How to strategies writing. Where will the table of content be found? What are they even going to talk about in the ebook? Where do I go online for research?These thoughts get overwhelming and cause what we call a “ writers’ block”.And if you want to go to a freelancer, they can take forever to finish. And to get a quality product you have to spend a huge amount of money.There is something else that people do to get ebooks done is stock templates. You can download one ebook template. But you are looking at the spending of about 50 to 200 dollars per each template. And if you create a lot of ebooks every year, that amount of money will quickly stack up. And be a load that you can’t afford to survive.A simple powerful tool like Sqribble solves all of those problems very easily.You can do all of those and much more with just only one cloud-based software, and that is Sqribble.Features of SqribbleTemplatesAutomatic contentFlipbooks on the goFriendly UiTemplatesThe reason why Sqribble is so friendly for beginners is because of these templates.

Scaling New Heights: The Rebrand Story of SaaSBOOMi,https://medium.com/saasboomi/scaling-new-heights-the-rebrand-story-of-saasboomi-3764e914ce83?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"SaaS,Software,India,Entrepreneur,Branding","In the summer of 2015, a group of SaaS founders came together to network, share, and learn from each other. Today, the group has grown into a massive community of SaaS founders, leading India’s SaaS ecosystem and being closer than ever to realizing their ambition of evolving India into a SaaS nation. Through our evolution as a SaaS community, we have constantly kept improving and adding new verticals/products in our quest. We have introduced engaging podcasts and blogs in the learning hub. Insightful events like SaaSBOOMi Growth and SaaSBOOMi Build, each targeted to help founders and SaaS leaders at specific stages of their SaaS journeys, and our monthly meetups under SaaSBOOMi Playbook, have all added to our portfolio of activities. We have grown together as a brand and hence figured that it’s time our branding reflected that.Adding more to our excitement, we onboarded an agency, Studio 318, which was tasked with rebranding the SaaSBOOMi community to reflect the global ambitions of the brand and to build a unified, cohesive, and consistent platform towards bringing the community and its various activities, events and initiatives under one roof.The Essence of SaaSBOOMiTo understand the values that drive the spirit of SaaSBOOMi and the different ways the community symbolizes this concept, Studio 318 facilitated workshops, exercises, and numerous sessions with Avinash Raghava, Suresh Sambandam and myself until we were confident that we had absorbed the essence of what we were trying to recreate. The three main values of SaaSBOOMi that came out of these sessions were:Pay it forward — The philosophy at the core of the communityFriendliness — The spirit of helping each other growUniqueness — The attitude of being a decentralized community in the ecosystemThe Personification of SaaSBOOMiToday’s brands are more than just static entities. They have a voice, a heart, and are more personally connected and communicative with their audience as an actual person would. So we set out to figure out who SaaSBOOMi is as a person and what the brand voice should be.InformalFriendlyPositiveWhat is “Pay It Forward”Like many things in life, paying it forward is easy to say but is pretty hard to be put into practice, and the SaaSBOOMi community does it effortlessly. But how does it do it? What is it about SaaSBOOMi that brings forth this noble ideology in all its members? After carefully studying all its activities, we identified what makes SaaSBOOMi special.ReliabilitySaaSBOOMi can be represented as a family or friend, someone you can rely on any time you need. Whether to share knowledge or help in finding resources, the community is always willing to “Pay-it-forward”.SupportSaaSBOOMi can be represented as the support system for your business, held together by fellow founders and practitioners.Knowledge you needSaaSBOOMi can be represented as a learning ground among equals who are willing to share their knowledge towards achieving a common goal.Giving back to the communitySaaSBOOMi is all about giving back more than we take. It can be represented as someone who helps nurture the SaaS community together with your fellow founders, share your knowledge, experiences, ideas, and learn together.A Stronger LogoTo give structure and firmness to the logo, we moved from a circle to a rounded square to represent the intrinsic strength of the community. We established a hierarchy in font weights to enhance legibility. The dimensions of the wordmark are altered to fit into a golden ratio box for visual harmony.Consistency Through TypeOkta Neue is an extensive typeface built for the web and app realm. The letters are geometric which are easy on the eye & legible in various sizes. The use of a single typeface across all brand touchpoints enhances brand recall and maintains consistency.The Colors of InclusivityWhat makes a perfect ecosystem is a way it embraces the many, to become one. SaaSBOOMi is the coming together of many for the sake of a common goal. For a brand that stands as a SaaS ecosystem, the diverse colour palette represents the numerous aspects of the community while the primary colours (white and black) represent the unity and inclusivity of the community.Approachability Through IllustrationsInspired by the unrefined first-thoughts that translated into global software, the language developed for the illustrations depicts the friendliness of the community. They are hand-drawn, rough, and all-humans with cloud-like heads. The idea behind introducing illustrations for the brand was to make it more approachable and fun.Holistic, Thoughtful DesignExtending the brand identity to all the verticals, we designed a system that is infused with colours, illustrations, and elements in an attempt to bring new energy and positivity to the brand.To A New Beginning!The SaaSBOOMi community is no less than a family. It is an inclusive community where dialogue, ideas and support are strongly encouraged. It is a place where every SaaS founder can feel welcomed and safe. So at every stage of the design process, we tried to capture and reflect the spirit of the community. This wouldn’t have been possible without Avinash Raghava and Suresh Sambandam for always being available to answer our endless questions, as we dug deep into the core of the brand.Rebranding is not a walk in the park. It is rather a marathon which needs heavy design thinking, logical reasoning and visual rationales that connect to human emotion. When we were starting this project, we had the option of going with the best design agencies possible but we went ahead with Studio 318, a team of 8 passionate designers trying to do something different. We felt that they had great potential and could deliver the best. We weren’t wrong! The Average age of our design & development team is 24, and these dreamers put-in their heart and soul in this process for creating something unique. We’re excited to see the growth of SaaSBOOMi and are glad to be a part of the journey. Let’s pay it forward!Authors Note: I would like to take this opportunity to appreciate the team behind the scenes. To start with, Rachana, Anisha, Vinay, Vishnu & Shaaz, the entire team of ‘Studio 318’ for their two months of relentless & committed work. A big shout-out to Manish, Vasishta & Revanth at ‘Outshade’ team for executing the development of the website in no time, and to Rakesh Mondal - UI UX & Visual Designer for helping us streamline the translation of the UI and UX.Special thanks to Avinash Raghava, SreeVishnu Mallela, Sadhana Balaji and Varun for helping me put together this blog.#SaaSBOOMiA Pay-it-forward community for SaaS foundersFollow57 SaaSSoftwareIndiaEntrepreneurBranding57 claps57 clapsWritten byTarun DavuluriFollowCommunity Evangelist and Ecosystem Builder | Sr Fellow @SaaSBOOMi | Writes on Startups and TechnologyFollow#SaaSBOOMiFollowWe are a community of founders and product builders shaping India’s SaaS industry.

Tryst With Destiny: An Entrepreneurial Pledge,https://medium.com/saasboomi/tryst-with-destiny-an-entrepreneurial-pledge-62dae34070dd?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"India,SaaS,Entrepreneurs Pledge,Software,Independence Day India","We will, on August 15th 2020, be celebrating our 73rd Independence anniversary. Like every year, pious statements of intent will be made on eradicating poverty, emotional recallings of the lives and sacrifices of the many who brought us to the present and inspirational speeches will be made on our (continued) potential to become a world power this century. The tragedy is that this has largely become a ritual. The fact that rhetoric without the concomitant instruments of hard work, will, commitment, investments, confidence, innovation, teamwork, research, capital, appropriate policies, laws and regulations, remains just rhetoric. While we have no doubt travelled afar from 1947, we remained constrained for long with a satisficing approach rather than maximising our potential. We shouldn’t be, indeed cannot afford to be, satisfied anymore with this satisficing approach; Dil maange more!Today in 2020, with the benefit of hindsight and, hopefully, the foresight, we need to re-craft a 21st-century vision for India. One that is based on our talented entrepreneurs, rapidly changing digital infrastructure, our growing domestic market, global market opportunities, fast-growing capital availability and confidence and conviction. Entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial thinking are the bedrock of transformative change. Wealth creation and societal impact is a result of a consistent, comprehensive, widespread application of entrepreneurial thinking. From Amul to Aadhaar, there are very many examples of how leaders with vision, curated innovative solutions keeping the end beneficiary in mind.It is important for our entrepreneurs to demonstrate the building of organizations as opposed to just building a business. Why is this important? Entrepreneurial companies are the manifestations of the beliefs and convictions of the founding team. Entrepreneurs challenge the status quo, seize opportunities, and attempt to create value for themselves and others. Building a business is done by very many, from the small paan-shop owner to the largest companies. Building an organization however, is different. An organization transcends the people, the time and place. An organization has a culture, a way of doing things, a way of thinking about things, a way of treating stakeholders, a way of executing projects. A culture that successfully and honestly triumphs over multiple “moments of truth” with every stakeholder, every single day is a culture worthy of emulation. This culture is rooted in ethics, a well thought through the doctrine of “right” and “wrong” behaviour, that is contextual, constrained by the law and appropriate for the situation.As more and more Indian companies deliver solutions to customers and businesses around the world, it is important for them, and for the larger ecosystem from which they emerge, for them to be role models. Why? It is important for the simple reason that it is good for business. A company that is a role model generates sound financial performance, generates goodwill, satisfied customers, motivated employees, eager partners and smiling investors. But doing this consistently, over protracted periods of time, as the company scales and grows in scope, is a function of its culture. In other words, the “company” becomes an “organization” thanks to its culture.Today, as technology and digital platforms cause enormous socio-economic disruptions around the world, and as Indian SaaS and other companies start making their mark on the world stage and attracting the attention of investors, it is important for entrepreneurs to think about the organizations they wish to create from the companies they founded. The creation of wealth, the creation of jobs, the creation of a new India are the larger downstream effects of creating successful organizations. It also brings responsibility and accountability. The ethics that hold these organizations together impact society through the transmission of values such as trust, integrity, of fairness, quality and respect.The responsibilities are therefore profound. The onus of creating organizations is a challenge for entrepreneurs. For India to be a Global Saas hub it isn’t just sufficient to develop software, it is important that the culture of global business practices, including and especially ethics, become a part of this cultural DNA. Leadership needs to think deeply beyond the immediate and think of the legacy of their company as they transform into organizations. Leaders need to worry about becoming the best leaders they can be while dealing with the uncertainty all around. Individuals need to deal with learning, coping with uncertainty, while becoming the best they can be. This transformation is not easy or even obvious. Evolving into a global class leader requires introspection, engagement with the external world, confronting troubling questions, managing oneself and others, across function, geographies, roles; demonstrate clarity of thought, all rooted too deep convictions about not just a mission that needs to be accomplished but about the way in which it would be accomplished. The world is changing, there is rising awareness about the role and impact of digital technology. Silicon Valley that had for long arrogantly eschewed any contact with Washington DC politics is now deeply engaged. The Congressional hearings of the so-called Big Tech leaders is a case in point. Indian entrepreneurs need to realise that as they become organizations, they need to walk a path that is crowded with issues beyond just software. This path isn’t clear, there isn’t a playbook on the precise steps that need to be taken to achieve the goals. However, what is known is the mission and, hopefully, and however tacitly, the values that bind the mission.On January 26th, 1930, a call for “Purna Swaraj” or complete self-rule for India as a republic, independent of the British Empire, was given in Lahore. No one knew how this would be actually accomplished, or what exact form this would take, or even the precise steps that needed to be taken to accomplish the Purna Swaraj. There was a sense of mission, an imagined possible end state, a set of possibilities, and the values that would buttress this goal, namely non-violence and Satyagraha movements. The goals of this Purna Swaraj were finally achieved only 17 years later! There were multiple paths and steps taken along the way but always, in general, hemmed by values.Today, Indian SaaS and other entrepreneurs have to similarly think of a mission. A galvanizing mission, an inspired commitment, a profound commitment to values to make India a SaaSBOOMi; to create wealth and jobs, while solving business, consumer and societal problems. There are many serious problems and challenges to solve in India, across sectors and across functions. From Agritech to EdTech to Fintech, from MSME credit to managing logistics, from security to analytics, there are enough and more challenges that offer valuable opportunities for the committed, deep thinking entrepreneur. As the Indian economy becomes formal, organized and integrated with the world, it is imperative for entrepreneurs to seize the moment to create global launchpads for themselves from their Indian hubs. And build organizations, not products, not businesses, not companies. That will be the real test.For this, a 21st-century entrepreneurial version of the “tryst with destiny” is necessary. The question then is, are we ready to take the pledge this August 15th 2020?#SaaSBOOMiA Pay-it-forward community for SaaS foundersFollow19 IndiaSaaSEntrepreneurs PledgeSoftwareIndependence Day India19 claps19 clapsWritten bySanjay AnandaramFollowFollow#SaaSBOOMiFollowWe are a community of founders and product builders shaping India’s SaaS industry.

O Analista de Negócios,https://medium.com/@juliamarquesg29/o-analista-de-neg%C3%B3cios-953678e69c5e?source=tag_archive---------2-----------------------,"Analista,Analista De Requisitos,Tecnologia,Software,Engenharia De Software","Você sabia que para desenvolver um bom software não são necessários apenas desenvolvedores? Pois é, o time de desenvolvimento é multidisciplinar, ou seja, vários profissionais de diversas áreas são envolvidos no processo de criação de um software.Dentre estes profissionais está o analista de negócios. Você sabe qual seu papel dentro do time? Quais suas principais características? Afinal, quem é esse tal de analista de negócios? Não sabe como responder?! Este texto é pra você!Pra começar é importante entender que o analista de negócios tem como principal função criar soluções e documentá-las, em formato de requisitos de software, de modo que o cliente e o time todo possam compreender. Este profissional tem um papel importantíssimo dentro do time pois, além da papelada, faz parte do seu trabalho entender do negócio e atuar como um parceiro do cliente e também do time.Parceiro do clienteUma das funções do analista é entender o negócio envolvido no projeto e, para isso, nada melhor do que se juntar as pessoas que já o dominam!O cliente, neste cenário, é o maior parceiro do analista de negócios já que é ele quem tem as informações sobre processos, estratégias e necessidades do negócio. Por isto, o profissional deve se aproximar do cliente e coletar as informações necessárias.Isto pode ser feito de inúmeras formas como entrevistas, envio de questionários, leitura de documentos ou até mesmo a observação em campo. Não posso dizer que uma forma é melhor do que a outra, tudo vai depender do cenário que o analista estiver atuando.Depois de entender as motivações e estratégias relacionadas ao negócio e ao projeto, o papel do analista passa de aprendiz para parceiro. O analista deve ir além do que é diretamente solicitado a ele, é parte do seu trabalho auxiliar e direcionar decisões e, também, sugerir soluções viáveis e eficazes.Ou seja, a relação do analista com o cliente deve ir além do “trabalho de garçom”, ou seja, um bom analista não apenas retira os pedidos do cliente, ele também o auxilia estrategicamente, ajudando a construir um projeto cada vez mais adequado e valoroso.Parceiro do timeTambém faz parte do trabalho do analista entender as limitações técnicas e tecnológicas envolvidas no desenvolvimento. Para compreende-las é necessário que este profissional se aproxime da equipe técnica.O primeiro passo dentro desta parceria é ajudar o time técnico compreender os objetivos do projeto. Entendendo as metas de negócio, o time técnico será capaz de auxiliar não só na validação mas também na construção das soluções e no levantamento de dúvidas.É fundamental que o analista realize a validação das soluções com o time técnico, para que possa garantir a viabilidade e possíveis riscos das mesmas antes de passar para o cliente, evitando possíveis frustrações.A parceria do analista de negócios com o time técnico é uma via de mão dupla, já que o analista precisa de ajuda para as validações e o time técnico precisa compreender as motivações e expectativas envolvidas no projeto. Sem esta relação, é bem provável que haja retrabalho para ambas as partes.Seu trabalhoO trabalho do analista de negócios é baseado em parcerias, mas vai além da conversa com todas as partes envolvidas. É necessário registrar e documentar as decisões e soluções, mas como fazer isso?Bem, a documentação pode ser feita de inúmeras formas. Para saber quais documentos são necessários, o nível de detalhamento e os formatos a serem utilizados, é essencial avaliar o perfil e necessidades da equipe e do projeto.Nem só de texto vive um analista de negócios. Este profissional também pode ser responsável pela criação das interfaces e protótipos do projeto, por isso, recomenda-se que conheça conceitos de usabilidade e boas práticas para ideação de telas.Então, ao finalizar o detalhamento o trabalho do analista está concluído? Não! O analista de negócios é responsável pela disseminação do conhecimento de negócio para o time e, quem deve oferecer apoio a todo o time durante as etapas de desenvolvimento, homologação e até mesmo de entrada em produção do projeto.Além disso, é esperado de um analista um bom trabalho de gerenciamento de esforço, guiando o time dentro do que foi acordado e fazendo os alinhamentos necessários.Então, Quem é o analista de negócios?Como podemos ver, o papel do analista vai além dos requisitos de software. Seu trabalho inicia junto ao cliente, entendendo os problemas e motivações e evolui para uma parceria, onde identificam e propõem melhorias para os processos e sistema em desenvolvimento. Depois de entender os objetivos e necessidades, o analista de negócios realiza um repasse para o time técnico, com quem vai validar as soluções tecnicamente.Um bom analista de negócio tem a habilidade de enxergar o todo pela perspectiva do cliente, usuário e do time. Este profissional deve ter como uma de suas metas proporcionar uma economia inteligente para o cliente, ou seja, entender o que de fato é valoroso e necessário para o projeto evitando assim frustrações e desperdício de tempo e dinheiro.Written byJulia Marques GomesAnalista de negóciosFollow4 4 4 AnalistaAnalista De RequisitosTecnologiaSoftwareEngenharia De SoftwareMore from Julia Marques GomesFollowAnalista de negóciosMore From MediumDonald Trump Won, No Matter What Happens NextJessica Wildfire in The Apeiron BlogThe Election Should Never Have Been This Closeumair haque in Eudaimonia and Co20 Things Most People Learn Too Late In LifeNicolas Cole in Better Advice(Why) There Was no Biden Landslideumair haque in Eudaimonia and CoThis Is ‘I Wish a Motherf*cker Would’ Week for Black PeopleMarley K. in ZORAMy daughter was a creative genius, then we bought her an iPhoneStephanie Gruner Buckley in Modern ParentI Worked the Polls in Trump Country — and Left More Confused Than EverAaron Gell in GENTop lessons learned from working with a 10x developerJeffrey Bakker in Level Up CodingAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

Striking A Software Balance: How To Choose Programs For Efficiency,https://medium.com/readwrite/striking-a-software-balance-how-to-choose-programs-for-efficiency-88899fae03b9?source=tag_archive---------4-----------------------,"Efficiency,Software","Back when they had few options, businesses had to think critically about what tools they would use and how, and carefully consider the best ways to complete a given task. Today’s tools may be more powerful, but those charged with choosing the right platforms are often overwhelmed by their scope, as well as the sheer number of options. Such excess actually makes it harder for businesses to determine whether they’re doing something in the most efficient way. When six different programs can all easily complete a task, does it really matter which one your company chooses? Yes, it does.Picking the right software can substantially boost your business’s efficiency, help keep costs down, and make your company more agile, but it isn’t always easy. By intentionally evaluating your current software, your process-based needs, and by setting targeted performance goals, you can streamline your digital ecosystem and optimize your company’s performance.Start With GoalsThe first step for any business seeking to streamline their software use with a focus on efficiency is, unsurprisingly, goals-based planning. What does your business do, and how do you define the successful completion of your professional aims? Planning isn’t just outlining a project idea, but framing how long it will last and how you’ll measure whether you’ve met that goal. This is why most experts recommend using the SMART planning process.SMART is an acronym for how goals should function. A goal must be specific, measurable — many goals leave out this step, it must be achievable, it needs to be relevant within the bigger picture, and finally, it must be time-bound. If you don’t know how long a task will or should take or how you’ll determine a project is complete, then you don’t have a SMART goal. And while you can, and should, use SMART planning across a variety of tasks, it works particularly well for choosing software programs for several reasons — reasons made evident through the evaluation process.Evaluating Program NeedsOnce you define what your core goals are, as a business and specifically for your software ecosystem, it’s time to look at what tools you’re already working with and what tools your company needs. This evaluation process should weigh several factors, including software integration, ease of use, scalability, redundancy, and cost. These elements will carry different weights in the final decision making. For example, it may be worth it to pay more for a program that delivers more automation through business process management (BPM).Remember: time is money, so a program that costs more but saves time may still come out ahead of a more affordable program that requires greater staff engagement to complete tasks. In fact, time management is one of the most significant business concerns as software systems multiply, since a significant percentage of lost productivity stems from the need to switch frequently between programs.Cutting The FatAs your business evaluates what tools it needs in order to efficiently meet its goals, you’ll also likely uncover that your company has some loose ends floating around. That could mean several things, including that:You’re paying for software subscriptions you no longer use. This happens surprisingly often, in much the same way that many individuals end up with stray media subscriptions. Because the payments are automated and are small, relative to the overall scope of business spending, they may be overlooked.You’re still running old software and it’s burdening your system. It takes time and effort to shift data and processes away from legacy programs, but it’s worth doing. Those programs are rarely optimized for speed and tend to be clunky compared to purchased solutions. They slow down your network, don’t integrate with new software, and it’s time to transition away from them.You’re running processes through several programs to get results that really only require one. Most popular business software integrates, at minimum, with other programs from their own suite of offerings, but even more often with the other top names in business software. For example, since the majority of companies use Salesforce, other software brands design their platforms for Salesforce integration. But while it’s one thing for a process to move through several integrated elements in order to complete a process, anything that requires staff to manually transition information between programs is doing more to hinder your business than to help it.All of these factors are strong indicators that you need to make some updates to your software suite if you want your business to achieve maximum efficiency. Cutting back on the number of programs you’re running and instead focusing on choosing a small, targeted suite will also help your business minimize the risk of security breaches, speed up onboarding, and more.Key Efficiency FeaturesYou’ve set out your goals. You’ve evaluated your current software holdings and needs and gotten rid of the elements that aren’t working. Now your business is finally ready for the software adoption segment of the optimization process. There are several key features that you’ll want to focus on during this process, including:Standardized Scripting: Remote monitoring and management platforms (RMM) have made it possible for businesses to streamline large scale data collection and analysis, but there’s no one size fits all approach to this process. Instead, the best RMM platforms include a script library so that your businesses doesn’t need to craft the code from scratch for every new operation. Script libraries aren’t quite automation, but they enable automation.Integrated Pathways: As noted above, integration is an important part of efficiency. If you have to manually navigate process pathways to complete an otherwise automated task, you can just about guarantee that there’s a better way. Look for software with integrated, automated process pathways for your most common tasks, such as invoicing, report generation, and patch management.Easily Scaled: Scalability is critical to business success, and it’s one of the great advantages of today’s SaaS model. Though you may not have any intention or need to scale up in capacity right now, if your business is thriving, you’ll need to increase capacity (data volume, number of licenses) at some point down the line. If a program makes that hard to do, it’s not the program for your business.High-Level Service: Customer service tends to be overlooked when businesses are choosing software. That’s not because it doesn’t matter — it’s just because it’s harder to test for. You can run a sample of software and watch demo videos, but you can’t be sure about support and maintenance services until you’re in the thick of things. That being said, you can discuss vendor support services before committing to a contract. Will they dispatch a consultant to help with IT issues, or will they leave you talking to a chatbot? These details matter.Overcoming Barriers To Software TransitionWhen a business needs to shift its processes, they tend to drag their feet. Making such a change may feel impossible or it may seem like there’s no right choice — or just too many choices. It’s okay to feel hesitant, but it’s important that you don’t let anxiety over innovation hold back your business. Instead, acknowledge your concerns and develop a plan that takes those concerns into account. By plotting out your goals, carefully evaluating your existing tools, and selecting for ease of use, automation, and strategic value, you can shift your business into its next iteration. It’s easy to get stuck in a rut, but your business won’t survive that kind of stagnation. Keep your eyes on the next step.Frank LandmanStriking A Software Balance: How To Choose Programs For Efficiency was originally published on ReadWrite on August 15, 2020 by Frank Landman.ReadWriteReadWrite is the leading media platform dedicated to IoT…FollowEfficiencySoftwareWritten byReadWriteFollowThe latest #news, analysis, and conversation on the #InternetOfThingsFollowReadWriteFollowReadWrite is the leading media platform dedicated to IoT and the Connected World.

The MongoDB Aggregation Cheatsheet,https://medium.com/@haydnjmorris/mongodb-aggregation-cheatsheet-a0afacefa81c?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Software Development,Software,Data,Database,Mongodb","What is an aggregation pipeline?An Aggregation Pipeline is a series of blocks of computation that you apply one by one to set of documents.Each pipeline stage performs some new computation or manipulation on the documents to which it is passed, and then passes them on to the next stage.The stages can find, filter, join or manipulate the documents and there is a pipeline operator for just about everything that you want to do.That being said, I would estimate that 90% of the pipeline-ing that I do consists of $match, $project, $lookup, $unwind and $group.So, let’s get into it.$match: finding and filtering documentsMatch does what it says. It passes only the documents that match the query that is used on to the next stage in the pipeline. This works exactly the same as the filter query that you pass to MongoDB’s find() method.There is a whole range of aggregation expressions that can be used to make your $match more flexible.$project: re-shaping documentsProject is a way of re-shaping the documents that you have at a particular stage in the pipeline. Projection doesn’t filter or find any documents, so there will be the same number of documents in the pipeline before and after this stage, but the documents will look different.You can rename/remove fields, or create new calculated fields. This is great for simplifying the documents and making sure that you have only the data that you need.You are also able to select the fields that you do want, or the field that you don’t want by using 0 or 1 as the projection value. Note, when using 1 to only keep fields, _id will always be kept unless you specify otherwise!$lookup: fetching from different collectionsThe ability to look up documents in other collections is one of the most powerful aspects of aggregation.Let’s say that you have a collection of orders, and you want to see the information about the products relating to each order. Using regular query functions for this is extremely inefficient, because you would need to run a query for every order so as to get its product information. It is far more efficient to get all the information using one aggregation query:// NOTE: You can use individual values AND arrays for the local and foreign field! 😎The $lookup adds a new field (products) containing an array of documents where the specified localField and foreignField are matching.$unwind: breaking out of arraysThe $unwind operator takes an array field and makes a set of identical documents, one for every element in the array.Using $unwind with $lookupIt is common to see $lookup used in conjunction with the $unwind pipeline operator. $unwind takes an array property on a document turns it into a new document for every element in the array.Let’s say that you have a collection of products, and you want to find the Suppliers of the products in the collection from the Supplier collection:// Product documents:{ _id: 1, supplierId: 1 },{ _id: 2, supplierId: 4 },{ _id: 3, supplierId: 2 },You can use $lookup find the supplier like this:The problem here is that a lookup returns an array of documents:// Product documents with $lookup'd suppliers:{  _id: 1,  supplierId: 1,  supplier: [{    _id: 1, name: 'Alice'  }]},{  _id: 2,  supplierId: 4,  supplier: [{    _id: 4, name: 'David'  }]},{  _id: 3,  supplierId: 2,  supplier: [{    _id: 2, name: 'Bob'  }]},Because we know that _id is a unique field we also know that the array that is created by the lookup will only ever have one element, so we can unwind the documents.// 🚨REMEMBER: You need to prefix the field that you want to unwind with a ‘$’This rolls out the arrays and leaves us with what we wanted 👍:// Aggregated product documents with suppliers:{  _id: 1,  supplierId: 1,  supplier: {    _id: 1, name: 'Alice'  }},{  _id: 2,  supplierId: 4,  supplier: {    _id: 4, name: 'David'  }},{  _id: 3,  supplierId: 2,  supplier: {    _id: 2, name: 'Bob'  }},$group: collecting documents into groupsYou can use $group to bunch documents together based on a field value that is common to all of the documents. It can also be used for useful things like summing all of the values of a specific field.// NOTE: If you want to group all documents into the pipeline at the point the group is executed into one document, then you can set the group _id to null// 🚨REMEMBER: when using fields from the documents in the accumulators, you nee the ‘$’ prefixGroup only passes along the values that you specify within the stage. In the previous examples the only items on the documents after the group stage would be _id and count in the first, or _id and maxReference in the second.If you want to keep the other field on the the object you need to decide how the group should deal with them. There are a number of ways to accumulate the fields together:ConclusionThis is just the start, with the various operators, expressions, accumulators and all the other tools that MongoDB provides you can retrieve your data on your terms.Happy aggregating!Written byHaydn MorrisSoftware EngineerFollow18 1 18 18 1 Software DevelopmentSoftwareDataDatabaseMongodbMore from Haydn MorrisFollowSoftware EngineerMore From MediumRate Limiting in GolangJustin GraberAnsible In ActionAhmad FaragFavouring full matches in ElasticsearchDavid de Boer in The StartupAWS Glue 101: All you need to know with a real-world exampleKevin BokSolving Facebook’s 2020 Front-End Engineering InterviewJoey Colon in Better ProgrammingSolving Paper Mario Ring Puzzles with Tree Traversal in PythonRichard Chung in Python In Plain EnglishNever talk to strangersZvonimir Spajic in We are madewithloveThe Rise and Fall of Visual BasicMatthew MacDonald in Young CoderAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Office 365 backups and You,https://regarding365.com/office-365-backups-and-you-d449974f1b4a?source=tag_archive---------2-----------------------,"Office 365,Backup,Software,Microsoft","Soo many options???I’m not going to cover what Loryan Strant covered in his post about backing up Office 365. You can read it here. What we have all been wondering since receiving test units from Synology to test drive their Active Backup for Office 365 solution, was why??I mean, like Loryan mentioned, there are a ton of vendors out there, selling Office 365 backup solutions. Companies like Mimecast, that have been doing Exchange backups since the beginning of time, Veeam, AvePoint, etc. They all do it. They all do it rather well and its all cloud based so no hardware is required. What was the point behind Synology getting into the Office 365 backup game?I have a few thoughts on the subject, after spending the last two months with the DS920+:Simplification — Most vendors out there that offer online backups have portals AND licenses AND config’s AND user access permission requirements, and you end up having to consider  a.) where your data is being stored,  b.) how it is being stored and  c.) who has access to it outside of your organisation. With Active Backup for Office 365, from Synology, YOU own the hardware that it gets backed up to. Its why Synology sent us their newly released DS920+ NAS . You purchase any of their devices and you get Active Backup for Office 365 for free. Read that again, FOR FREE. There are no perpetual license fees for it. Its yours, forever, because you bought a NAS. Have a look here for a list of supported devices.Portability — Yes, pick up and go. The DS920+ is smaller than a mITX PC. It has 4 internal bays (64 TB), expandable to 9 (144 TB) through an expansion unit. No longer do you have to worry about carrying out a server should you move to another building, (companies are doing this all the time, especially now, during COVID). It consumes very little power (109.84 BTU/hr at full load).Ease of use — As Loryan mentioned in his post, this is what really intrigued me. Plug in, navigate to the portal, the management console is discoverable on your network and presto, you are in.Synology NAS portalFrom there, you select the application you want to install and follow the process. (Loryan’s post covers the backup steps and configuration)Package CenterI managed to backup approximately 130GB in about 4 and a half hours.Active Backup Task progress4. Accessibility — Once backed up, you can allow users to recover their own data through the Active Backup end user portal which you get to decide if you want to make available to users.So why would any company want to have a cloud service backup on-prem? Surely they moved to the cloud for all the reasons why companies move to the cloud?Cost — this is arguably the cheapest Office 365 backup solution available in the market currentlyOwnership — Its your device. You take it with you, there is no vendor lock in. You can export the data yourself should you want to move your backups off Synology and onto another platformMulti-cloud backup — There are many organisations that not only use Office 365. Synology offers a host of other supported backup services, including on-prem as well as other cloud services like G Suite.Its more than just for Office 365 — The uses of Synology NAS, through their extensive application ecosystem, provides organisations with a single view into their backup/storage/syncing strategy. You can drop Gib repo’s onto it, use it as a file server, A RADUIS Server, the list is exhaustive.SME/SMB market — With Microsoft positioning its M365 Business plans for smaller organisations, the Synology range of NAS/backup devices are perfectly suited for companies that do not have the budget or need for enterprise priced backup solutions.Synology offers end to end storage and backup solutions for every possible scenario. I would highly recommend that companies explore this, before getting caught into other platforms that are licensed perpetually and that are almost impossible to export your data should you want to leave.I’d love to hear about your experiences with backup solutions for your Microsoft Tenant so please comment here or reach out to me on Twitter.If you enjoy this post, please hit the “Clap” icon/button thingy.

Are you a good programmer?,https://medium.com/@iluga/how-to-recognize-good-programmers-695fb2b2f874?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"Programming,Software,HR,Pshychology,Iq","“Are you a good programmer?” It’s not black and white. I think it’s a spectrum where different characteristics determine your overall ability.Some of them can be:IQPersonalityExperienceKnowledgeSocial interactionsAdaptationThink of it like an RPG game where your skill points determine what kind of role you play,but here you get a role in terms of a title — “Automation engineer”, “Cyber secuirty specialist”, “Team Manager”, etc…RPG GamelikeTherefore let’s determine a different goal than just recognizing “Good programmers”.“Is this particular developer a good choice for my team or purpose”That’s something I always say — first set your goals and purposes then achieve them.Chacteristics of a personThere are 2 types of characteristics “Static” and “Dynamic”Static — Things a person can’t change like personality, IQ , experience, etc..It would be silly to say a progammer only can be good if he has a set of experience — nobody can gain a year of experience overnight.Dynamic — Things that can change like knowledge, motivation, health, etc…This determines the abilities of a person and yet even better — determines what abilities a person can change.Particulary interesting are Motivation and knowledge.Motivation:A book I recommend is Dan Arieli’s book “It’s worth it” (שווה לך).I’m not a pshycologist but I can definitly say motivation has a great impact on a person’s ability to code something.No motivation will result in worse code and bad tests.Knowledge:The more the better! We can’t learn everything in the world but as we aquire more knowledge we get better and learn different tools that solves issues.This can speed up the process of development.If a developer is able to develop a generic reuseable method in no-time — it’s a very big win.Five big traits:This model tries to generalize the personally of a person.It’s widely used so I think it’s a good metric to start from.For those who don’t know the five factors:Openness — open or more closed for new ideas.Conscientiousness — determines the organization and control abilities.Extraversion — Is a social party monster or a shy library student.Agreeableness — Are you willing to work with others, or crush them?Neuroticism — Emotional control. Neurotic people tend to be more negative in thoughts.Measuring the five factors alone won’t help you to guess right persons ability to cope with tasks or to code.However let’s inspect their values towards programming:Openness:People that are high in openness tend to be more creative and intellectual, they can grasp abstract ideas faster.This is useful for architecture, design and problem-seeking. Some development tasks deal with unknown details we need to gather, either if it’s the code that we are not familiar with, or the requierments that are not complete.Extraversion:I’d say it’s a more classic scenario of a nerd and social people.Today it’s very important to have “people skill” in development position — you work with people ALLL THEEEE TIMEEEEE.Some development or programming positions don’t require as much work with people.This includes: small start-ups or sisyphean work like security research.Agreeableness:This trait isn’t related to any programming activity.I’d say this trait is important for large companies where people tend to collide with one another.A group of low agreeable people will tend to collide more and raise their voices.While the agreeable people will sit more quietly — this can affect important design decisions.So my advise is — if you are an agreeable person, raise your voice if you think a decision is not a good one.Neuroticism:Even people with negative thoughts can help in a design process or software construction.More neurotic people can think of more scenarios where things will break and fall, where the user would use the feature in a “wrong way” or not “intended”.Social animalsThe era of geeks sitting in their basement coding stuff is partially over.Some jobs will require more alone times with the bits and bytes.Most development jobs will require human interaction as well, oh these nasty humans.Ego & CompetitionWorkplaces should reduce competition between teams — or at least reduce unhealthy competition where people will likley to take turns on hating each other.Combining the Ego part you get a nice soup of stress and anxiety.It may get the job but in the long run it will suffocate developers and will burn them out.Esentially good developers will set their ego aside and focus on their craft.Healthy CompetitionThe industry is a competition and each company is also a competition — that’s the nature of people, they are trying to best one another. Some people will cope more, and some won’t.Either you are coping or not, try to maintain a single behavior — do not make things worse. Good developers don’t fall into competing with their peers because they know their worth.Eventually everyone has something to learn from one another.“A true master is an enternal student”.ClientsI don’t mean UI interfaces — what I mean are people who make requierments up.In a mid-big company the clients are replaced with salespeople and product managers.The sales will tell the developers “We can’t sell the product without X”.Product managers may know the need ot the clients and design a feature that will suit them.The developer need to know how to take these not-so-technical requirements and make them yes-so-technical. It’s not just tranlating coffee into code but translating words into software.ManagersMost of managers in the field were developers, but good developers =/= good managers.If someone is a good developer, it doesn’t mean they’ll handle managers well, but good managers can take advantage of good developers effectivally giving him tasks that suits him. If a manager isn’t utilizing his developers, they will never be as good as they can be.Therefore it’s crucial to see if a working environment is engaging enough to utilize good developers and minimizes impact of bad ones!Intelligence — IQWe’ll abstract the ideas over Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory.Some terminology:Fluid — Raw power, pretty much what you are born with.Crystallized — Learning from environment, experience.General — General intelligence or the g factor.Broad — Crystalized, Fluid, Memory, Processing speed.Narrow — a specific form of an ability.Broad abilities sorted by importance — top most is what I think most important.Comprehension-Knowledge (Gc):Includes the breadth and depth of a person’s acquired knowledge, the ability to communicate one’s knowledge, and the ability to reason using previously learned experiences or procedures.Fluid reasoning (Gf):Includes the broad ability to reason, form concepts, and solve problems using unfamiliar information or novel procedures.Long-Term Storage and Retrieval (Glr):Is the ability to store information and fluently retrieve it later in the process of thinking.Visual Processing (Gv):Is the ability to perceive, analyze, synthesize, and think with visual patterns, including the ability to store and recall visual representations.Quantitative knowledge (Gq):Is the ability to comprehend quantitative concepts and relationships and to manipulate numerical symbols.Reading & Writing Ability (Grw):Includes basic reading and writing skills.Processing Speed (Gs):Is the ability to perform automatic cognitive tasks, particularly when measured under pressure to maintain focused attention.Short-Term Memory (Gsm):Is the ability to apprehend and hold information in immediate awareness and then use it within a few seconds.Auditory Processing (Ga):Is the ability to analyze, synthesize, and discriminate auditory stimuli, including the ability to process and discriminate speech sounds that may be presented under distorted conditions.Decision/Reaction Time/Speed (Gt):Is considered part of the theory, but is not currently assessed by any major intellectual ability test.AnalysisI want to emphasize 4 abilities:Comprehension-Knowledge (Gc).By far the most important ability of a developer, it’s basically the description of the brain.The ability to connect new information to the old one you store and the depth of this information.So if you read something about C++, new information should reinfornce old ideas, or change them to be better.If you gather knowledge and your old knowledge is simply dissappearing, learning may not be so effective.Fluid reasoning (Gf):Programming is all about being logical.This is because basically it’s a circuit — 0s and 1s all over the place just in form of text instead of numbers.Using this logic we need to solve human-related issues with new information or missing information.Long-Term Storage and Retrieval (Glr):Are you running an HDD? Upgrade to SSD!Memory is cruical, but don’t pressure yourself into memorizing everything, just like einstein said:“I never commmit to memory anthing that can easily be looked up in a book”.This is so simple and elegant I love this.Half of the stuff I know is actually written in OneNote pages, I can easily look it with Ctrl+E shortcut.Why do I need to memorize all the details?Don’t remember details, try to abstract them in a way you remember.For example C++ hides many details about allocations, just remember there’s a concept of memory and it should be handled.When the time comes, the details can be retrieved and then you can solve the allocation problem more easily.Visual Processing (Gv):This is actually is something I aquired while playing Baduk (Go).It’s not a “MUST HAVE” ability but it helps when you can visualize your classes and solutions and how it will look like.In games like chess it’s simply called “read ahead”.The first process in software development is the design document and gathering prerequisites, if you can visualize them and seek them before the need arises — you have yourself a better design step towards implementation.ExperienceWe must discuss experience if we are comparing development skills.Just like characteristics of a person experience also comes with Static and Dynamic experience.Static -Usually the same repeated task that is full automated in our brain.Like configuration a server or gathering information.Dynamic -Variance in the job — dealing with different challanges.It’s not enough to say that a senior programmer has “10 years of experience”.What did they experience? The same tedious year 10 times? Or actually 10 meaningful years?From my perspective it comes down to a individual personaly , people that tend to be more open (Openness!) tend to have more “fullfiling” years rather than executing the same configuration tool for 10 years.Managers should really understand how to engage their people better, even if they have high opennes with great amount of learning ability it doesn’t mean they’ll achieve anything if they are kept low on doing repeated tasks.If you are a developer and you are reading this — Start to practice in variaty of languages and tools.Learn different operation systems, learen how the network works, learn how Hadoop works, try to mingle with GraphQL.Knowledge seeking“To know where you can find anything that in short is the largest part of learning”. — AnonymousSeeking information is the first step of being good at anything, and with the internet of 2020 you can find practically anything — Medical books, gaming coaches, car mechanics guides, How to water plants, etc…For developers it’s crucial to know where to find the right documentation, the right api, the right set of commands.Or else you’ll be the guy that asks too many questions.Knowing how to seek your knowledge is a crucial step for being an independent developer.Hobby, passions and the Ikigai.Hobbists tend to be more passionate about their craft,Searching for new frameworks and learning new stuff is part of the passion. It’s also ok not to be intersted in programming after work. From my experience people that see their job as something meaningful, will enjoy it more and try to evolve in the field themselves.The japanese has a a word for it — Ikigai.Finding your ikigai in a technology field can be fulfiling and meaningful.Software skillsThe nicest people or the smartest people aren’t always good developers.We’ll get over important set of skills for software development and see how they contribute to being a good developer.Some of these skills are aquired from experience.DesignSoftware engineers or so called “Architects” are the titles for the design process of a software. I’ve mentioned the design process couple of times here so let’s dig into that one.The design process is the documentation of construction blocks in the software (For example “Classes”), alterantives and the whys — Why did the designer chose to go with solution X instead of Y.It should also contain more details like — configuration, performance metrices, compromises, etc…Better designs come with experience. From my experience there is no ‘perfect” design— strive for a “Good quality” design. If a compromise is done — the programmer should know why it’s a compromise and what are the risks.I’ve had one manager that told me it’s all about “Risk managment” — He’s right. Some solutions are risky, The programmer needs to mitigate and control the risks.AbstractionsNobody teaches that stuff — abstraction and pattern recognition.Beginner devlopers tend to be more specific on details, like “We have a list of melons that should be transfered in a cart” so they go and implement a Cart class and also a Melon class and everything works and they are happy.A more experienced developer would say “Wait a second, we have transportation of goods here” so he goes and implements a transportation layer — because who knows, it’s no longer 300 b.c and we might have a train and not a cart, and melons aren’t the only fruit on this planet so he goes and build better containers to hold also apples and watermelons.Thinking in abstractions doesn’t cost you more development time if you — from experience — know how to automatically think in that way.In terms of thinking and time it costs the same, a more experienced developer just recognizes this much faster.Patterns recognitionIn programing it all ends up it 2 terms: input and output.A more experienced developer would know this already, a beginner one would just start to graspt this idea.Actually the one the I heard saying that was Uncle Bob, I really like his lectures and I think he’s one of the biggest influencing speakers in software world.(At least for me)When I say patterns I don’t mean “Design patterns” — it’s also true but what I mean is reoccouring concepts that you’ll end up seeing in almsot all systems.Input & Output are 2 patterns that will always be there — in classes, in methods, in systems, in apis, etc…After that it’s just a simple question of: How fast one recognizes patterns.A good characteristic for development and programming is pattern recognition, because humans are good at this — most of people have no trouble in recognizing reoccouring methods and concepts.Characteristics of softwareSoftware has different end goals.Real-time software isn’t like BI software and healthcare systems aren’t like gaming software.FunctionalityPerformanceReadabilityMaintainabilityResiliencePortabilityUseabilityWriting a program ends up being compromises on some stuff.High-Performance code tend to be less maintainble or less readable because of performance patterns.Configurable systems tend to be less maintainable for operation — what kind of configuration we need.A good mind would think on these compromises to achieve the end goal.FunctionalityThe end result should function how we desired it to function.If a pancake robot makes omlettes instead it’s nice, but we required pancakes and now we are sitting eating eggs instead.Furthermore down the hole — hidden functionality always hits a software in cruical spots.Usually it means “Technical functionality” like if we want to send a mail — what kind of SMTP client we’ll use or what kind of template for the mail we need.Other hidden functionalities are stuff that wasn’t discussed with the client or something that didn’t come up in the design process.The programmer fills the details, the higher level of details the better end result.Readability and maintainabilityRefers to the ease of understanding the code and the ease of fixing or upgrading the code.A code that is easier to understand, fix and upgrade is code that is more resilient in the future.New people will have easier time to get into that code and start to maintain it if cruical bugs are needed to be fixed.PerformanceEfficiency is key, a good mind will try to keep things as-efficient-as-they-can-get.Again — compromises.I won’t be going into the all shabeng of “Early optimizations is the root of all evil” because this quote is annoying and got out of hand.It’s actually not the complete quote so if you mind — go read the whole quote.Other characterisitsA certian goal will change your code for good or worse.A good example is exception handling -To throw or not to throw? This is a tough question.The programmer will have to decied on what kind of resillience the software should have.ToolingTools are important for development, there are many small tasks we need to perform that aren’t related to code, it may be: accessing the DB, using 3rd party tool to test integrations, visualizing data, searching files, sniffing the network, reading logs, etc…We all know these “gurus” where they have literally tools for everything,It’s not that hard to be a guru in that way because all you need to do is keep a list of handful tools.Regonize tools, search for tools, build the tools!A good developer knows his way around tools.Version controlI think everyone are using version control nowdays.Because version controls are used with tools it’s the same as tooling — know your way around the appropriate tools.Testing & AutomationTesting is a controversial subject, so what I’ll say is my opionn.First of all testing is a necessary skill to have — how to design them and how to write them.Automated tests are even better — they are a reliable proof of quality that can run again and again.Regressions are more easy that way, and at the end the QA can veryify that the software is in good shape and quality for production.Working with these skills in a complicated development process requires experience and knowledge.Knowledge is the dynamic skill here so a developer can be better by gaining more knowledge on the subject.So…..People and software are complicated.In the end it’s the quality that matters — The best software for the people.Thank you for Reading!Written byIlugaI’m a professional software developer with many other hobbiesFollow4 4 4 ProgrammingSoftwareHRPshychologyIqMore from IlugaFollowI’m a professional software developer with many other hobbiesMore From MediumAccepting CounteroffersAndy AngHow People with Learning Disabilities Handle Their Differences in the WorkplaceForbes in ForbesThe Unexpected World of Working AloneGentleman Jim in The StartupThe way we work doesn’t work, anymoreStowe Boyd in Work FuturesHow to build collaborative product development teamsJon Robinson in Slalom Business10 Powerful Reasons Why You (and I) Haven’t Quit the Corporate WorldJamie Jackson in The StartupAchieve More Despite Feeling DiminishedVy Luu in The AscentIs This the Final Nail in the Coffin for the 9-to-5?Hope Carson in The StartupAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

How Software as a Service (SaaS) Benefits Your Business,https://medium.com/illumination/how-software-as-a-service-saas-benefits-your-business-a09ec4b931dd?source=tag_archive---------5-----------------------,"Technology,Business,Software,Cloud Computing,Small Business","Photo by ThisisEngineering RAEng on UnsplashSoftware as a service (SaaS) continues to grow in popularity for a wide range of businesses due to its many benefits.SaaS makes it possible for businesses to access software on the cloud without the need for buying and installing software on each computer. SaaS also uses a subscription-based model, as you will only pay for what you use each month.Here are a few of the top reasons why SaaS can benefit your business.Work From AnywhereSaaS uses cloud computing to make it possible for employees to work from any location with an internet connection. All of your data is updated in real-time, which makes it easy for employees to work with others in different locations.Many businesses are transitioning to a remote work environment, as SaaS makes it possible for employees to stay productive from nearly anywhere.Minimize CostsLooking at ways to reduce costs is always a high priority for business owners.SaaS is an affordable option for most companies, as you will not pay for individual software licenses. Instead, you will pay a fixed fee each month for software applications.You will only pay for what you need, as this is a great way to save you a lot of money in the long-term.Reduce Employee WorkloadAn added benefit of using SaaS is that it makes the job of each employee that much easier.Employees will never have to worry about installing new software or downloading the latest patches.Ultimately, this is a great way to boost employee productivity as it allows them to focus on their work without any additional distractions.ScalabilityBusinesses also have the flexibility to scale up or down at any time to best meet their needs.You can easily add new users or scale back down during slow periods for your business. This is a great way to keep costs to a minimum, as you can make these changes with only a few clicks of a button.Less DowntimeDownloading and installing conventional software for your business requires a lot of time and effort. Keeping all of your software up to date with the latest patches is also time-consuming.However, you can avoid all of this downtime by using SaaS.Everything is automatically handled in the cloud, which saves a lot of time and is much more convenient for your employees.Closing ThoughtsChoosing to use SaaS for your business is an excellent option for companies small and large.Reducing costs, improving accessibility, and minimizing downtime are only a few of the many benefits of using SaaS for your business.Reaching out to a SaaS provider is always a great way to learn how this technology can benefit your business and help you take advantage of the latest software applications.ILLUMINATIONWe curate outstanding articles from diverse domains and…Follow467 1 TechnologyBusinessSoftwareCloud ComputingSmall Business467 claps467 claps1 responseWritten byMarcus MusickFollowA freelance writer that enjoys writing about the Dallas Cowboys and many other topics.

Clean Code — Formato,https://medium.com/@ovidiojosearteaga/clean-code-formato-a0938f496198?source=tag_archive---------8-----------------------,"Clean Co,Robert C Ma,Programaci,Software","Esto forma parte de una serie de artículos sobre mi lectura del libro Clean Code, de Robert C. Martin.Robert Martin además de todas las cosas que he comentado en publicaciones anteriores también no indica cómo debemos formatear nuestro código, debe ser para nosotros (programadores) un orgullo cuando otras personas miran nuestro código y quedan sorprendidos ante su organización.Por suerte hoy día tenemos herramientas que nos ayudan a hacer la labor de formato mucho más fácil indicados de manera activa cuando estamos fuera de los lineamientos de formato establecido.Esto nos deja ante la importante tarea de establecer, al iniciar el proyecto, de manera consciente, cuál es el estilo que vamos a utilizar y aún más si estamos en un equipo de trabajo, ponernos de acuerdo sobre ese estilo, configurando nuestra herramienta con esas reglas de estilo establecidas. Y es que, para el autor el tema de formato está más relacionado con la comunicación, por lo tanto, cuando trabajamos en equipo es indispensable pensar en el formato y llegar a un acuerdo dentro del equipo.Pero (sobre todo cuando trabajamos en solitario);¿Cuántas veces nos detenemos a pensar en el formato que le vamos a dar a nuestro código al iniciar el proyecto?¿Cuántas veces configuramos nuestro linter de turno para ciertas reglas de estilo que funcionarán mejor para el proyecto?Para el autor esto resulta una tarea muy importante, que además habla de nuestra profesionalidad.Es cierto también que los linter actuales ya tienen una serie de reglas predefinidas y que incluso, puedes importar para tu proyecto reglas de estilos de otros equipos. Pero ni siquiera nos sentamos a analizar estas reglas al menos una vez para entenderlas, de tal manera que, podamos tomar la mejor decisión para nuestro proyecto.El autor nos da indicaciones muy detalladas desde su perspectiva y experiencia profesional. Cosa que revisaremos:Formato VerticalNuestros archivos deben tener entre 200 y 500 líneas. Esto es una idea a mi parecer ya anticuada, la experiencia ha demostrado que si por ejemplo nuestra clases están bien diseñadas y refactorización, sus tamaños tienden a ser más pequeños que 200 líneas. Aunque como dice el autor esto puede variar entre proyectos.Apertura Vertical entre conceptosEl autor recomienda que las separaciones de líneas sean utilizadas para ayudarnos a relacionar conceptos. Hay dos ejemplos muy interesantes, si por ejemplo tenemos dentro de un método la declaración de una constante que va a ser utilizada como parámetro al llamar a otro método que le sigue en la siguiente sentencia, entonces lo mejor es dejarlos juntos sin separación de línea entre ellos.Otro ejemplo es sobre los métodos de nuestras clases, separar cada método con una línea intermedio, aunque esto me parece de sentido común, porque resultaría muy difícil leer dos métodos totalmente unidos si una línea intermedia que separa el fin y el inicio de los métodos.Declaraciones de variables y propiedades de clase.Para el autor las variables dentro de un método deben declararse justo donde se van a usar. Aunque para métodos muy cortos, las variables se pueden declarar al inicio del método. De igual manera las propiedades de clase deben declararse al inicio de la clase, esto último también lo considero una práctica hoy en día muy utilizada.Funciones dependendientesSiguiendo con la idea comentada en publicaciones anteriores sobre la lectura descendente. El autor recalca la idea de que las funciones que se llaman unas a otras deben mantener un orden descendente. Eso con la finalidad de facilitar su lectura, y si se hace siempre, los lectores de nuestro código se acostumbraron a dicho estilo y les será más fácil encontrar las funciones invocadas.Formato horizontalEl autor nos dice que él tiene un límite personal de 120 caracteres máximos en una línea. El menciona el límite de Hollerithhttps://medium.com/@kgomara_37026/the-80-column-limit-originated-when-herman-hollerith-got-the-contract-for-the-1890-us-census-using-eed2f3330905Esto establece un límite de 80 caracteres en nuestras líneas, a mi parecer personal esto es suficiente en la mayoría de casos, pero como siempre todo es relativo al proyecto y al lenguaje que estemos utilizando.Apertura y densidad horizontalPara manejar los espacios en palabras en nuestro código, el auto da unas pautas que algunas son de sentido común otras son muy interesantes. La bases de sus recomendaciones es que con el espacio también podemos agrupar o destacar conceptos en el código. Por ejemplo, separar el signo de asignación con espacios a los lados destaca su propósito. Otro ejemplo es que podemos usar los espacios en blanco para destacar la precedencia de los operadores, aunque yo me decantaría más por el uso de paréntesis “()”Alineación horizontalEl autor comenta que hoy no tiene sentido el uso de alineaciones horizontales porque pueden hacer perder el sentido y aspectos importantes del código. Como por ejemplo cuando se declaran un grupo de propiedades al inicio de una clase, es cierto que puede tentar al lector de ver solo los nombres sin fijarse por ejemplo en sus tipos.Personalmente he visto mucho el uso de este tipo de alineación en el mundo PHP, sobre todo cuando se intenta asignar valores a objetos para luego pasarlos como parámetro. Que a mi parecer no pierde ningún sentido lógico y si da mejor sensación en la lectura.SangradoEl sangrado en nuestro código es un tema también de sentido común, ampliamente utilizado para asignar niveles de jerarquía a nuestro código, con el podemos entender fácilmente qué instrucciones son parte de un if, o qué sentencias pertenecen a un método. El autor recomienda nunca sucumbir ante la tentación de romper este sangrado como por ejemplo con un if de una sola línea.Estos son los puntos en los que el autor da pautas para tener en cuenta a la hora de escribir nuestro código.Written byOvidio Jose ArteagaFollow10 10 10 Clean CoRobert C MaProgramaciónSoftwareMore from Ovidio Jose ArteagaFollowMore From MediumDonald Trump Won, No Matter What Happens NextJessica Wildfire in The Apeiron BlogThe Election Should Never Have Been This Closeumair haque in Eudaimonia and Co(Why) There Was no Biden Landslideumair haque in Eudaimonia and Co20 Things Most People Learn Too Late In LifeNicolas Cole in Better AdviceThis Is ‘I Wish a Motherf*cker Would’ Week for Black PeopleMarley K. in ZORAI Worked the Polls in Trump Country — and Left More Confused Than EverAaron Gell in GENMy daughter was a creative genius, then we bought her an iPhoneStephanie Gruner Buckley in Modern Parent“Anyone but Bernie”, They Said.Lauren Martinchek in Dialogue & DiscourseAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Will IT Outsourcing To Poland Save You Money?,https://medium.com/leocode/will-it-outsourcing-to-poland-save-you-money-6acfcf729e9c?source=tag_archive---------9-----------------------,"Outsourcing,Money,Leadership,Tech,Software","Eastern Europe is a considerable solution for every company looking for a reasonable software outsourcing solution. Thanks to a well-developed and highly competitive IT market, countries such as Poland or Ukraine become the place of choice for many business owners and CTOs. Hard-working mentality and constant improvement, along with the talent pool growing with each passing year, eastern Europe offers near to perfect conditions for creating long term tech partnerships.How can outsourcing help business efficiency?Eastern Europe is a highly profitable region for software outsourcing. You can expect a high-quality product for the average rates lower than in Western European countries. However, reasonable rates aren’t the only benefit that attracts business owners to hire developers in Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, and other Eastern European locations.Cost efficiencyMaintaining tech teams is pricy. Organizations want to cut their IT expenses without decreasing efficiency, especially in COVID time. Choosing developers from eastern Europe can be an adequate compromise between quality and cost, allowing you to lower your firm’s expenses. Nordic companies can save up to 30–50% when outsourcing engineers from Eastern Europe, compared to expenses in their countries. Hourly rates of polish software developers are on the rise but there is still a significant gap between eastern European and western costs.North AmericaCentral EuropeEaster EuropeSenior Developer$70 — $120$40 — $80$30 — $60Intermediate Developer$50 — $90$35 — $70$25 — $40Junior Developer$50 — $80$30 — $50$20 — $35Business Analyst$70 — $80$50 — $80$30 — $70DevOps$70 — $90$50 — $70$40 — $60Scrum Master$50 — $80$40 — $70$25 — $60Graphic Designer$60- $80$50 — $70$25 — $60Growing Talent PoolThere are over 6 million software engineers in Europe. In opposite to Western Europe suffering from a tech specialist shortage, Europe is facing the opposite tendency. The possibility of choosing experienced developers from a wide tech talent pool makes eastern European countries even more attractive in terms of outsourcing solutions.Convenient LocationA direct flight to major European IT cities takes up to 2–3 hours. Most eastern European airports offer direct flights to Berlin, Amsterdam, London, and other major tech hubs. A regular flight from Scandinavia takes an hour or less which is an additional benefit of outsourcing developers from eastern Europe.Cultural similarities & English ProficiencyThis is where cultural differences come into play. Central European people are more similar to western Europe or even Americans, in terms of communication skills and level of assertiveness. We are not afraid of saying ‘NO’ to the client when it appears to be in his best interest. Most of my previous clients agree that it is a major value, especially if you compare eastern Europe to India or Asia. We do not promise unrealistic terms or agree to solutions potentially making the product worse. We’re professionals to the core and most developers speak fluent English, which makes the communication much easier and allows better clients to software-house relation.Schedule a free callAre you considering outsourcing your tech team to Eastern Europe? Contact me if you’re looking for a reliable tech team, or a reliable development process, which you can control and be in charge of. I’m here to help!We can discuss the process of building an external tech team step-by-step. Experience gathered both as an IT client and a service provider has helped me to understand the issues surrounding this process and to find the best solutions for the challenges you might encounter (as well as potential risks). I’m happy to answer your questions and help you refine the process of finding the right solution for your IT needs.Feel free to share your thoughts and concerns, I will be happy to discuss it (damian.winkowski@leocode.com).LeocodeYour Reasonable Tech Partner.FollowOutsourcingMoneyLeadershipTechSoftwareWritten byLEOCODEFollowWe build custom software solutions, developing web, mobile and desktop apps with Big Data, Blockchain and Machine Learning.

And sometimes, you don’t even have to spend great amounts of cash just to get a good entertainment system in your home.Take for example surround sound; you’ll obviously need good surround speakers if you want a powerful sound experience, but if you can settle for less in terms of hi-fi, then you don’t actually need all five (or seven) speakers anymore. The reason is that there are already a few applications that can transform stereo into surround sound, and Ashampoo Soundstage Pro is one of them.An easy-to-use application for immersive soundOnce installed, Soundstage Pro will act as a virtual sound card that processes the audio signals from your PC and modifies them in order to create a surround output. The program is meant to be used with a good pair of headphones so you can experience the full effect. The colorful interface is easy-to-use as it allows you to control each virtual speaker separately, by adjusting the volume or by muting or soloing them.You can have a 5.1, a 6.1, or even a 7.1 configuration, but you can also use a standard stereo configuration. You can also choose between a few sound presets that are named after big cities such as New York, London, Paris, Moscow, Dubai, and Shanghai; changing the presets will not only modify the sound, but it will also display a different landscape in the main interface.Some functionality problemsEven though the Soundstage Pro changed the sound in my headphones the way it promised, I wasn’t able to adjust the volume for any of the speakers, apart from the ones in the front-left and front-right. Also, I have to admit that I don’t really get the Boost function. On one hand, it does warn you that it acts as a powerful distortion and that you should be careful when using it. On the other hand, who needs such a powerful distortion? Wouldn’t a smooth increase in volume or gain have been more useful?Even though the application needs more polishing, Ashampoo Soundstage Pro can be a decent choice if you want surround sound in your headphones.Written byKylewaddeInterested in computers, gaming, science and mobile tech.FollowSoftwareMore from KylewaddeFollowInterested in computers, gaming, science and mobile tech.More From Medium4 Things To Know About How Technology Will Evolve Over The Next DecadeGreg SatellPandemic Politics: SKYNET, protests and the misuse of wartime surveillance technologiesInternational Affairs in International Affairs BlogHow to Support Protesters From HomePCMag in PC MagazineSoftware Matters in the WorldAnil Dash in Glitch: Make Better SoftwareTo Live or Die by Google Search Brings an Escalating CostBloomberg in BloombergHow to Stream Games When Sharing a Wi-Fi NetworkPCMag in PC Magazine3 Ways to Stream Movies and TV for Free Through Your LibraryPCMag in PC Magazine5 reflections on technology from 2018Rohan RajivAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

Benefits of Church Management Software,https://medium.com/@hridoyd389/benefits-of-church-management-software-20b2a54ca944?source=tag_archive---------32-----------------------,"Church Management,Software","Often in novels and movies, you must have come across churches and chapels, especially in the country, where the vicar knows all his parishioners and takes care of their well-being. You may meet all the family members in your congregation and often invite volunteers to help you with various church-related tasks. In a church, especially a large church with many members, priests, and other officials have many types of tasks to complete, ranging from spiritual ones like spreading the word of the Lord to daily administrative ones like keeping track of funds. When a church grows in size, not only in structure but also in membership, these duties become difficult to administer and it needs support that can take care of many of the mechanical tasks such as accounting and reporting, and for this, the church management software is a perfect solution.Today, there are many software options that you can consider, designed solely for managing church affairs. In addition to simplifying and streamlining your tasks, they allow you to retrieve information whenever and however you want. The best part about this software is that you can go back and remember the task for a particular day without wasting time or effort. In addition, the storage of all information is safe when using such software. Many leading software companies have created church management software with different features that make managing church affairs easier and faster. While some systems remain completely online, some work without the Internet.So how could Best Church management software benefit a church and its officials? Here are some examples:Member details storageNo matter the size of a church, it will have a certain number of members who must be followed up and kept in touch. Although today’s lifestyle makes people move from one place to another comparatively faster, a responsible church always tries to maintain its whereabouts. The church management software allows you to store all your contact details in an organized and methodical way. Also, you can edit these details and retrieve them easily without crossing out the words and cluttering the paper.Keep and store recordsThe management software has the function of storing any number of records about the parishioners of a church. Gone are those old, dusty shelves full of files with papers that crumble to dust when you touch them. Now when someone comes to you looking for information from 20 years ago, you don’t have to go to that old storage room to find such an old file. Just by looking up the entry for that particular year online, you can get all the details in minutes or even seconds.Finance trackingA church has to handle money for various purposes. She often receives contributions and funds from members and other charitable organizations. In addition, there are contributions from regular parishioners for services. Added to that, there are regular monthly expenses at the church, as well as expenses for special occasions and festivals and parties. These funds must be properly tracked and recorded without errors. Efficient church management software can help you calculate and store all of this financial information in the best possible way. The software’s password system also protects this data.Church software is designed to be operated by non-techies. And therefore they are often very simple and easy to use with a user-friendly interface and navigation. They come at affordable prices and offer wonderful solutions that not only save you time and effort but also make your work faster and more efficient.Written byhridoyblogHello There, I’m an content writer.

Organizing Documents in ClickUp,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/organizing-documents-in-clickup-fa88bec18c7d?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Clickup,Productivity,Software,Business,Self Improvement","Photo by Wesley Tingey on UnsplashClickUp is a wonderful productivity tool for both teams and individuals. I have written several articles to help you get started; you can find those links below.But in positioning itself as “One App to Rule Them All,” they have set the bar quite high. Based on my two years experience off and on with ClickUp, they are more than capable of clearing that bar. But, if they want to compete with the likes of Evernote, one area that needs work is the storage and retrieval of documents.With the release of version 2.0, last year, ClickUp introduced its docs feature. It is very robust, allowing the importing and exporting docs in a variety of formats. You can also create your own docs on the fly, as I have done with this article. But as of today, all of the documents end up in one big bucket, with two simple sorts and a filter by name option. Of course, the excellent search function of ClickUp will allow you to find any document quickly, but having come from Evernote, I am used to some internal organization.Screenshot from ClickUpBut wait, one of ClickUp’s premier features is its high level of hierarchical organization. Having used many productivity apps over the year, most of which have, at most, two levels of tasks, ClickUp has four; spaces, folders (formerly known as projects), lists, and tasks. But so far, they haven’t extended that hierarchy to the docs portion.Robotics- A Business Perspective | Data Driven InvestorOne fine day you are walking in a park with your little kid playing around and suddenly you notice a physical…www.datadriveninvestor.comAfter using docs for a while and porting a few over from Evernote, I decided I needed more organization than ClickUp offered, so I was initially hesitant to use any docs unless it was directly related to a task I was working on.Hold the phone. The lights haven’t clicked on, but it’s getting brighter in here.I was working on moving my writing process and workflow from Notion over to ClickUp. I had recreated my tasks and custom statuses, which allowed me a lot of freedom with Kanban boards. In Notion, each item was stored as a record in a database, and one of the fields was a page, which contained the body of the article.In setting this up in ClickUp, I noticed the attachment icon at the bottom of each task. I figured I could create the article however I wanted, store that in OneDrive, Google Docs, or DropBox, (yes, I have all three) and then attach it to the task. In doing so, I noticed the second option, New Doc.Screenshot from ClickUpBingo, now the lights are on.Screenshot from ClickUpWhen I created one, I noticed two things, one, the icon at the very top said I was in Docs Home, but the breadcrumbs on the document showed I was still in my task hierarchy. Sure enough, when I closed out of it and went back to the Docs view, there it was.Screenshot from ClickUpThis worked great for my articles, and I have been using this method for months. If I want to look at an article, rather than go to the Docs folder, I use one of the many views I have built of my articles list and pull it up from there.So, now I had an idea but still didn’t have a way of organizing random documents. But then, I remembered a lesson I had learned when I first started porting my articles to ClickUp. Originally, I wasn’t using the list in ClickUp as a workflow, but merely a storage area with stats for each article, similar to one of my Notion views.As you know, ClickUp is all about task and project management, but each ‘task’ doesn’t have to have a due date, or even a Do Date, as @august LINK would say. This leaves me the freedom to build table views of data that aren’t part of a project or contain a task. I am using a system like this for paying bills, where I don’t want a due date cluttering up my tasks.So, I have looked at and built two different methods of organizing Docs in ClickUp. You can use whichever you like, or devise your own. I am still deciding which is best in the long run. Regardless of the method, each document is attached to a task of the same name with no due date. I can and will add other useful fields, such as dropdowns or labels, to add tags, context, and anything else I think of.My current hierarchy contains three spaces, Business, Personal, and Inbox. In one method, I have created a new Space called Storage. Within that, are two folders, Business and Personal, and under that are lists, that correspond to my current lists. I don’t use many folders in my task management, which gives me another layer to play with.In each of those lists, I create the tasks that will contain the document. Of course, if it were a real task, the document would be attached to it in my normal workflow.In the other method, I have simply created the task for the document in the existing list that holds tasks for that area.In both cases, the task and document name are the same, making locating a particular doc easy.Both methods have pros and cons; you can figure out which you like best if either. Looking at feature requests and the roadmap, I’m not sure how soon ClickUp will create something similar that is native to the app.I also have to experiment to see which one lends itself better to the mobile app, which is getting faster all the time.Of course, regardless of the method, all the docs are still in the Docs Home area, where you can find them with a quick search.One advantage of storing docs in ClickUp using this method instead of Evernote, is it forces me to think about why I am saving it. Since the beginning, Evernote has just been one big dumping ground for everything.I have it organized, but I still give little thought to when, how, or if I would ever need the document in the future.Using a more structured format in ClickUp makes me think it through and use more of a Just In Time mentality than Just In Case. As I wrote in my downsizing LINK article, our houses are full of crap we kept, just in case. I should know better than to fall into that trap with my document storage.I hope this helps clarify how to store and organize your documents in ClickUp and add even more functionality to this already fantastic program.Gain Access to Expert View — Subscribe to DDI IntelData Driven Investorempowering you with data, knowledge, and expertiseFollow55 1 Sign up for DDIntelBy Data Driven InvestorIn each issue we share the best stories from the Data-Driven Investor's expert community. Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

Constellation Network $DAG,https://medium.com/@Cryptopleb4_32442/constellation-network-dag-e4a00df3fafd?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Cryptocurrency,Crypto,Big Data,Software,Cybersecurity","Cybersecurity for Big DataWhat is Constellation Network?Constellation Network provides cybersecurity for big data. The Constellation Hypergraph Network provides a scalable and secure distributed network that validates data for enterprise and public sector clients. It is the first truly decentralized, infinitely scalable DAG protocol.Hypergraph addresses digital threat vectors prone to big data initiatives, IoT, and data transportation. It provides an infrastructure for an open decentralized data marketplace and an enterprise grade software solution for data provenance and integrity. It’s secure, cost-effective, scalable, and easy to integrate.The software infrastructure tool removes the financial and organizational cost of insecure data pipelines and bad data. It provides a secure and tamper-proof audit trail that simultaneously validates your data, allowing early visibility for data management teams into downstream issues — preventing bad logic across automated systems.PartnersConstellation only recently migrated to their mainnet, but already managed to build a very impressive list of partners. Some of these partners are the United States Air Force (USAF), MOBI, Chainlink, Quant, Decisive Point, Dcode, Mousebelt/BEA, MongoDB and Splunk.United States Air ForceConstellation’s technology will help securely unlock traditionally siloed and non-accessible data and data sources. This is commonly referred to as Multi-Domain Command and Control (MDC2) at the U.S. Air Force.Multi-domain, cross-service stakeholders are disbursed, disconnected and complicated and the data created by each domain is either non-accessible or requires significant manpower to handle data forensics, planning, and collection. Constellation will create a leap in the USAF’s current capabilities with a focus on the agile interoperability of both legacy and future data types. It is a scalable and secure approach to Big Data processing while enabling the merging of legacy system data with existing cloud infrastructure data. As such, Constellation provides decentralized security not only to Air Force data pipelines, with encryption, but also creates audit trails and a live overview of the status of any data source.The USAF was very pleased with the results of this partnership and wrote a letter of support.USAF Letter of Support“The unique Constellation Blockchain for Big Data technology has significant potential to help Air Force cyber security and the 618 Air Operations Center (AOC) with commercial partners mission transaction interactions verifications by mitigating security risks of attack points like servers, cloud storage and centrally hosted access control systems that are either exposed to hacking and/or spoofing activities.The foreseeable result would successfully thwart spoofing attacks from intercepting and replacing an existing data stream with a data stream from a hostile agent or adds fraudulent information to the existing data stream.”https://constellationnetwork.io/government/Constellation tackles big data and blockchain with the U.S. Air ForceSAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 27, 2019 /PRNewswire/ — Constellation Network Inc., a San Francisco based technology and…www.prnewswire.comMOBIMOBI’s mission is to explore Blockchain and related technologies, promote standards, and accelerate adoption for the benefit of the industry, consumers, and communities. (https://dlt.mobi/)ChainlinkIn an important integration for the advancement of blockchain technology, Chainlink, with its Oracle Network, will be leveraging Big Data Solutions from Constellation to bring scalable real-world and streaming data to the Blockchain.This intergration will see Constellation to provide data and blockchain services, validate streaming data for the Chainlink ecosystem by becoming a Chainlink node operator.Through Constellation’s “Blockchain for Big Data” approach, the company is able to assist in providing data infrastructure tools for developers to enable interoperability between legacy and cloud data systems.More info on the Constellation and Chainlink partnership can be found here: https://constellationnetwork.io/3041-2/Quant“An Internet for Automation with IoT and Edge Devices” outlines how Constellation and Quant will provide robust security for IoT and interoperability of data between systems and devices for use cases like connected cities. Smart (or Connected) Cities can use IoT to develop and connect digital ecosystems that have many benefits, ranging from improved energy distribution and more efficient waste collection to connected cars and better air quality.In recent years, billions of dollars have been invested into the development of the Connected City, but progress has been held back by the lack of a sufficiently powerful, secure, flexible and interoperable technology able to interconnect the many blockchain technologies currently used. This new partnership will change this.More info on the Constellation and Quant partnership can be found here: https://www.quant.network/blog/quant-network-and-constellation-network-partnership-represents-a-major-step-forward-for-smart-cities/Decisive PointDecisive Point’s mission is to effectively combat the frictions that impede rapid adoption of new tech and services in the US Government.DcodeConstellation is part of Dcode’s AI cohort. (https://dcode.co/spring-2020-AI-cohort/)Dcode connects the tech industry and government to drive commercial innovation in the federal market.‘Government organizations trust Dcode to train them on innovative business and acquisition practices, the emerging tech landscape, and how to scale solutions and advance their mission. Dcode also offers federal agencies premier tech scouting and customized accelerators to solve critical challenges through commercial technology.’ https://dcode.co/government/150 companies have applied to become part of the AI cohort of Dcode and only 12 companies got in. Constellation is the only Blockchain company of those 12 companies.MousebeltMousebelt has setup the Blockchain Education Alliance (BEA). ‘The BEA will cultivate a network of 20 leaders in both industry and academia to jointly develop educational initiatives that accelerate mass adoption of blockchain technology. MouseBelt will organize meetups, and more to support collaboration. Members can also engage with researchers to develop new use cases that will address specific challenges within their industry.’Some of the other members of BEA are mastercard, Binance X, NEO, Kucoin and Ripple’s Xpring.More info on the Blockchain Education Alliance can be found here: https://cointelegraph.com/news/mastercard-binance-x-and-ripples-xpring-join-the-blockchain-education-alliance/amp?__twitter_impression=trueMongoDBConstellation has partnered with MongoDB to work on building a security layer within MongoDB itself. The partnership is a multi-phase breakdown. Currently Constellation is in the first phase, this means that they are an Independent Software Vendor. This allows Constellation to present MongoDB to clients (such as the USAF) as a suite of data management tools that work with Constellations technology. The second phase of this partnership will be to certify the technology with MongoDB enterprise.Currently Constellation is working with a few of Mongo’s account executives to make them understand how our Hypergraph and immutable ledger work ALONGSIDE MongoDB with a shared customer (United States Air Force).Technical integration paper: https://constellationnetwork.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/MongoDB-Constellation-Network-MongoDB-Technical-Integration-Overview. pdf (remove the dash between Overview. and pfd).SplunkSplunk Inc. is an American public multinational corporation based in San Francisco, that produces software for searching, monitoring, and analyzing machine-generated big data via a Web-style interface.Constellation Network has a Technological Alliance with Splunk (https://partners.splunk.com/locator/search?q=Constellation+network), Splunk is a tech giant currently worth $35b+ and is listed on NASDAQ. The team did not mention too much about this partnership but I have tried to connect the dots with DRC and I believe we did a fairly good job, read about it here: https://medium.com/@Cryptopleb4_32442/splunk-x-constellation-network-5964bebc3c3eFind out what a Technological Alliance with splunk means here https://www.splunk.com/en_us/partners/become-a-partner/technology-partners-program.htmlToken utilityTechnically speaking $DAG is the financial state channel of the Constellation Network. It allows the seamless exchange and interaction between the various state channels and nodes that make up the network. $DAG binds the components of the network together and enables them to relate to each other.In short, $DAG is representative of tokenised bandwidth, allowing for transactions above the rate limit and the monetization of data streams between businesses.DAG plays a couple of roles inside Constellations mainnet:- Nodes earn validator rewards in the form of DAG.- DAG is used to secure throughput on the network.- DAG will be used to purchase validated data sets on the network (programmatic data exchange).DAG allows for the tokenization of data packages which then opens the road to the network becoming a network for exchanging the data commodities of the future.Tokenomics: https://medium.com/@mateo_gold/token-economics-and-the-role-of-dag-in-the-constellation-network-74b73f4c3d5bTeamCEO — Benjamin J.

What To Do When a Customer Doesn’t Pay? Let it Go and Move On.,https://medium.com/saastr-all-about-paid-web-services/what-to-do-when-a-customer-doesnt-pay-let-it-go-and-move-on-c398caaff87e?source=tag_archive---------2-----------------------,"SaaS,Sales,Startup,Software","As you begin to scale and add a sales team, you’ll encounter more and more drama with “bad” customers. These so called “bad” customers from a sales team perspective will include:Folks that share licenses that shouldn’t be. Sales will get mad they aren’t buying more seats.Folks that use SMB or other editions that should be on your more expensive enterprise plans. Sales will feel they are getting ripped off; andFolks that sign contracts and don’t pay!! They signed a contract after all!The bottom line is all these scenarios will consume a huge amount of internal energy, create tons of drama, burn management team and distract folks from closing happy customers … and have no positive ROI. You have to let things go. And just learn from it. Learn how to do better next time.Let’s talk here about the seemingly most frustrating scenario, the last one — the customer that signs a contract that then doesn’t pay. “They signed the contract!!” your exasperated rep will say, worried he will lose his commission.First, let’s assume the customer is actually in the wrong (somehow). Before we even go there, take a breather and think about it from the customer perspective. Are you sure they are / were “wrong”?Ok, if they are in the wrong, then of course, you can just turn off the service. This is SaaS, after all. If the customer has deployed the product and is using it but has not paid, that will certainly get their attention. But … if you shut off a mission-critical service and disrupt their business, watch your NPS plummet below zero. You have to give them notice and a grace period before doing this. Assume you have done that properly though, shutting off the service generally gets folks to pay. It certainly did for us at EchoSign / Adobe Sign. A big red banner at the top of every page, with a 14 day countdown to service shutdown, got 99% of the deadbeats to pay. Or today, if a sponsor for SaaStr Annual doesn’t pay us after signing a contract … well … we just don’t build their booth. You move on. They may well sponsor SaaStr 2025.But what if they aren’t using your product, and never have? Then what?Here’s where you know you have a churn-and-burn deal. A deal you never really should have closed at all. Even if the customer signed a 3-year contract, if they never even used the product, one way or another, the deal wasn’t real. The sales rep might have sold them on functionality that doesn’t exist, or is too complicated to deploy. Or the product may be too much business process change for the customer in the end.Whatever it is, if a customer spent weeks or months looking for a vendor, evaluating a vendor, and signing a contract … and then never used you product … they certainly weren’t playing games. They wanted to solve their problem. They wanted your product to work for them. It is just, in the end, you couldn’t provide the right solution. And that is on you.Similarly, if they starting using your product and then 100% stopped … no matter what a contract might say, that’s on you. You failed them. No customer wants to do all the business process change of deploying an app into production and then have to stop using it and find another vendor. No one wants to do this. They only do it when the vendor simply does not meet their basic needs.When that happens, you may be frustrated. But it’s time to just move on.You can threaten them. You can attempt to send them to legal (but your legal fees will quickly grow larger than the deal value). You can send them to collections (but most collections agencies won’t do all that much in the end but send some letters and emails and maybe threatening phone calls. It’s not enough money.).But if you do any of these things to not let them go after you’ve failed them, then whatever goodwill you had during the vendor selection process will be gone.It’s better to move on. Perhaps you will get them next year, if the project just stalled. This is actually pretty common. Or perhaps you lost them to a competitor. But even if you lose a deal to a competitor, assume in 2–3 years you’ll have another shot at the deal. Be cool, and you might be able to get the customer back if the competitor stumbles.And remember, if you are going long — prospects and customers all talk to each other. Tons of companies producing large events talks to me, for example. I tell them which apps have been great for us, and which didn’t work for us but still might work for them. Vendors that we didn’t select, but treated us well, I often recommend to others based on their needs. But I really only advise them not to use the handful of vendors that have treated us poorly.So when a customer wants to leave, let them go. Thank them. Smile (even if it’s frustrating). Don’t try to enforce a (potentially dubious) contract for a service they aren’t even using.And then your chance of getting them back again later has just gone way up.Think of the old days. When folks gave Money Back Guarantees. Think if you did that. You might lose a nickel here, a dollar there. But think of how much friction that would take out of a risky buying process. And think of how much goodwill it would earn. At least some.And stop playing Rip Off the Customer games. We’ve all bought 100+ SaaS apps now. We know the good vendors from the bad ones. Be a good one. That’s the key to 140%+ net revenue retention.SaaStr: Scale Faster.

GSoC 2020: Mapknitter Export Module and Spectral Workbench upgrades,https://medium.com/gsoc-2020-mapknitter-export-module-and-spectral/what-i-did-d7bcf37c7e7b?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"Gsoc,Gsoc 2020,Open Source,Software,DevOps","What I didSpectral Workbench is an open-source tool to perform low-cost spectral analysis and to share those results online. It consists of a Ruby on Rails web application for publishing, archiving, discussing, and analyzing spectra online.Mapknitter Exporter Sinatra is minimal Sinatra app to run MapKnitter exports in the cloud, using the mapknitter-exporter gem.In my Google Summer of Code project I have gotten the chance to work across all three of these repositories and it was plenty of work, trust me.A little more about my proposal can be found herePreparing the environmentThis kind of work requires a lot of preparation, by this I mean prepare the environment for us to work on, and that’s what I did in Spectral Workbench, Exporter gem and Mapknitter Exporter Sinatra cli projects.Here I have basically rewrite the docker workflow of the project. Since it was a pretty old repository with very legacy code and practices, it required some restructuring on the configuration files. For instance, the MySQL instance was not dockerized at the time I started the project, and there was no automation that aided the developer to easily get to code.Still in Spectral, some sort of preparation was required at the continuous integration tool as well, at first it was needed to set up “local” builds for Travis, so that we could obtain a testing environment that simulated faithfully the development/production environment. Besides this, previously it was configured for the CI tool to run all tests at once — what seems to be a nice idea at first, but at long range caused the builds to last “forever”. Then, I have split the test running to execute each test suite separately, thus taking advantage of the parallelism implemented. Here and here you can find more about the mentioned changes.When it comes to the Exporter Gem project, the preparation consisted in getting the continuous integration tool (Travis CI) properly set up so it could reflect the project’s environment precisely. And also it included some performance upgrades since it has been also configured a multistage build so that the CI pipelines could run in parallel, and thus faster. This entire work is available at publiclab/mapknitter-exporter#470.A similar work to this has been developed at the Mapknitter Exporter Sinatra client project. The preparation for the upcoming updates involved significant changes in the Travis CI tool, this reflected on some performance upgrades since it was configured parallel builds and a script that sets up the packages needed for the application to run. It is also important to note that cache has been configured for every CI tool in each repository, that way, allied to the parallelism, the builds run significantly faster than before. All of this work can be found here.It is important to note that this work regarding the CI tool parallelization and better setup caused the builds to be around 2x faster than before, in all three repositories (Spectral Workbench, Exporter Gem and Mapknitter Exporter Sinatra).The Rails and DevOps upgradesAfter getting a nice test coverage, a proper CI and developing environment we could start with the upgrade itself. It’s widely embraced as a good practice to open smaller Pull Requests containing smaller and significant parts of code as in a granular upgrade. One of my plans for the project was obtaining a stable test coverage, by increasing the test coverage for the Spectral Workbench. It is important to say that this part of the plan was not accomplished the way it was planned, the test coverage was being achieved along with the rest of the main project and it did not make part of the “Preparation” phase of the project.I have embraced the same work strategy from last year that consisted in creating a development branch where I could merge the changes/hotfixes/upgrades/improvements to such branch then see how it went on the CI tools, and, if successful, keep working with the upgrade or something else. With this I could work faster, since it wouldn’t need to wait for the merge approval. Along with that, opening a PR from this development branch to the main branch made my work more transparent to the mentors.At this part of the project I have configured Ruby 2.6, Rails 4.2 and Node 13. This PR already introduced countless benefits for the Spectral project, for example, Strong Parameters feature that was introduced in Rails 4 prevents assigning request parameters to objects unless they have been explicitly permitted. Practically that meant removing the attr_accessible and attr_protected calls from models and adding a new method to the respective controllers to handle the parameters.The main advantage of all of this is that they are defined in the controller and can be dynamically assigned in run time attr_accessible was a more static and monolithic way to whitelist attributes, thus making Strong Parameters more flexible. Since every model has been refactored at the previously mentioned PR to give support to the Strong Parameters approach we now have a more modern and trustful code. Talking about security, the usage of strong params to HTTP requests wraps our “payloaded” objects better for requesting, which made the requests better structured.The majority of gems have also been upgraded, now supporting newer Ruby and Rails. And another good thing that came out of this too was that after the upgrade was complete, it was required a staging environment so that we could test out the changes that were made on the cloud. So along with the help of PublicLab’s sysadmin Sebastian, we have set up an automated staging environment, in a way that when I pushed to a staging branch, I could follow up the Jenkins build on the console and hit an endpoint to verify live the changes I have made.The Node version has been upgraded too, thus giving a better support for the javascript dependencies manager at the time, which was Bower.In the meantime my good friend Ruturaj was giving me ultra help with tests. All of his work is on the list below:https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench/pull/490https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench/pull/493https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench/pull/494https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench/pull/496https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench/pull/509https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench/pull/511https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench/pull/514https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench/pull/518He has been of great help for me, his help and friendship is the living proof of the great community the PublicLab is. He has taken a lot of his time to help me and made me very thankful. Reminded me of the good spirit that it is working with open source software.Visual representation of me and Ruturaj teaming up on the project.With Ruturaj’s help we got to increase the test coverage by more than 20%, Spectral Workbench went from ~60% to a little more than ~80%. This could be measured right after I got to include and configure SimpleCov to get the test coverage percentages here.At the Exporter gem some of my work consisted in refactoring the code base, to do that I counted with the help of Rubocop, a very well known tool in PublicLab’s ecosystem of projects. With Rubocop we got to standardize our coding and present to the newcomers some good coding practices. In a practical manner, one nice thing about this, is that we used the same Rubocop settings as the ones used in Plots2, Mapknitter and Spectral Workbench. Here is where I have Rubocop for the Exporter Gem, here is for Spectral Workbench and here is where I have set Rubocop for Mapknitter Exporter Sinatra, all of them following the same coding rules, thus making the PublicLab’s ecosystem more cohesive and uniform.Later, upgrading to Rails 5 was one task that took a little less time than upgrading to Rails 4, but it had me involved in a lot of different stuff.During this upgrade, there was a massive refactoring of our routes since this version of Rails doesn’t allow abstract routing anymore, due to security issues. So by refactoring, Spectral got less sensitive to security breaches. Also, during this upgrade I have removed Bower completely and set up the latest compatible Yarn, which meant a very significant upgrade for Spectral since Bower has been deprecated and no longer maintained. The entire Rails 5 upgrade can be found here.When it comes to testing, a main request of my mentor Jeffrey Warren for this project was the configuration and inclusion of some system tests, and I got to that here. It is important to notice that this involved configuring ChromeDriver and its adapter gems and also implementing a couple of tests to validate the configuration, which worked very well by the way.At this point a massive refactoration work has been made at the Mapknitter Exporter Sinatra client at publiclab/mapknitter-exporter-sinatra#56. Here I’m just on phase one of Sinatra’s modular code styling. According to the Sinatra docs: “When a classic style application is run, all Sinatra::Application public class methods are exported to the top-level.” Also, using the classical style prevents you from running more than one Sinatra application per Ruby process — all calls to these top-level methods are handled by Sinatra::Application, functioning as a singleton. We can avoid these potentially-confusing scoping problems by reorganizing our application into what Sinatra calls the “modular” style — which is what I’m starting to do here. Besides mitigating scoping issues, we could reduce code duplication(by using lambdas) and some other advantages.And finally, one of my last great contributions was the configuration of GitPod for Spectral Workbench and Mapknitter Exporter Sinatra. GitPod is an online IDE which can be launched from any GitHub page; within seconds, GitPod provides you with a fully working development environment, including a VSCode-powered IDE and a cloud-based Linux container configured specifically for the project. Having GitPod configured provided immense benefits for the community; the configuration for both projects can be found here for Spectral Workbench and here for the Mapknitter Exporter Sinatra.Other contributionsRemove command from compose filesHere I have helped in PublicLab’s Plots2 project that was failing to start the Passenger web server, causing the application not to start.

Learn How Computer Works and What is Binary in 2 minutes,https://medium.com/@biberogluyusuf/what-is-binary-a10efecfb6c8?source=tag_archive---------4-----------------------,"Binary,Coding,Programming,Software,Software Engineering","Computer hardware circuits only have two electrical states, on or off. Everything you see, hear and read on the screen reaches you as the result of “on” or “off” billions of times. That’s exactly what your device does whenever you use the internet to watch movies, listen to music using binary code, using only the numbers 1 and 0. Binary is representing numbers, letters, commands, images and sounds.Binary is a number system, just like decimal numeral system. Binary “1”s and “0”s is just a virtual representation of the underlying voltages.The voltages are just a way of representing the binary. In a transistor, an “0” represents no flow of electricity, and “1” represents electricity being allowed to flow. In this way, numbers are represented physically inside the computing device, permitting calculation.How to convert binary to decimalIn binary, the first furthest to the right is the digit is worth 1 in decimal. The second digit is worth 2, the third worth 4, the fourth worth 8, and so on doubling each time. Start from the right and take your current total so you can find the decimal equivalent of a binary. For example, the binary 101010 is equivalent to the decimal 2+ 8+ 32= 42:Here are some equivalent values:Convert a Letter to a Binary NumberASCII — Binary Character TableThe ASCII chart maps a unique number between 1 and 255 to all letters of the alphabet capitalized (A-Z) and lower case (a-z), numbers (0–9), spaces, and other special characters.THANK YOU01010100 01001000 01000001 01001110 01001011 00100000 01011001 01001111 01010101I hope it helps you.Written byYusuf Biberoğlu💻 PHP/Symfony Developer, Freelancer. https://yusufbiberoglu.com/FollowBinaryCodingProgrammingSoftwareSoftware EngineeringMore from Yusuf BiberoğluFollow💻 PHP/Symfony Developer, Freelancer. https://yusufbiberoglu.com/More From MediumHow to Create Rails API for your Poker App!Arthur Song in Dev Genius5 Tips for naming variables, functions, and classesBeto Rayashi10 Great Podcasts and Playlists for Mobile DevelopersZafar Ivaev in Better ProgrammingA Swift Introduction To Macros In The Julia LanguageEmmett Boudreau in Chifi MediaA Great List of Projects You Can Start Coding While at HomeAngelica Dietzel in Better ProgrammingEmulator vs SimulatorPadma Gnanapriya in The StartupHopscotch HashingMichelle BaoIf It Breaks, Then We’re GoodSergi Juanola in The StartupAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Declutter python code with error handling decorators,https://medium.com/@rinaarts/declutter-python-code-with-error-handling-decorators-3d7e71ea228b?source=tag_archive---------5-----------------------,"Software,Python,Error Handling","Image by Andreas Lischka from PixabayI recently reviewed some code which converted gRPC error codes into custom errors using a decorator and the simplicity and genius of it made me facepalm “why didn’t I think of it myself?”.Really, why didn’t I? When I wrote how to handle errors with grace I mentioned using decorators to validate input parameters and how important it was to keep error handling separate from your main code as much as possible. I just didn’t think to combine the two. Oh well, better late than never.Let’s see how it’s done:First we’ll define my_method(). All this method does is raise an exception, which I hope is not any real world example - but I'm doing it to make a point. For a single line of logic, I had to write 3 lines of error handling, obscuring what the method actually does.https://gist.github.com/rinaarts/724ea6c6833b6efb6601be596720745d#file-without_decorators-pyUsually, we’ll have a few more lines of logic, but also a lot more error handling. Checking different types of exceptions, reporting exception code which is a bit more complicated etc.Error handling fills our code with clutter, making it hard to follow what it actually does. What if you could Marie Kondo it and hide all that distracting mess in a convenient, reusable wrapper?Does it spark joy? Yes!Is it magic? No!We can do it using decorators.The simplest example is a catch all error handling decorator that catches all types of exceptions and prints them out.https://gist.github.com/rinaarts/724ea6c6833b6efb6601be596720745d#file-catch_all_error_handler-pyAll the exception handling logic is hidden in the decorator and out of my_method(), making it much easier to see that writing a method which only raises an error makes absolutely no sense.But that’s not all! We can add some more functionality in our decorator. In our next example we’ll see how to add retry attempts using a decorator.https://gist.github.com/rinaarts/724ea6c6833b6efb6601be596720745d#file-retry_error_handler-pyInstead of just catching the exception and reporting it, this decorator allows defining a number of retry attempts and it will retry the decorated function until it succeeds or the number of retries is exceeded, adding a growing sleep time between attempts.There are infinite possibilities for customizing the error handling decorator:Add retriable/permanent exception types to decide which to retryHelp callers of your method by wrapping exceptions with a single exception type (see why here)Add more complex logging codeRe-raise exceptionsetc.I hope you found this useful!Written byRina ArtstainSoftware Engineer @ Dropbox TLV • Coding while femaleFollow50 50 50 SoftwarePythonError HandlingMore from Rina ArtstainFollowSoftware Engineer @ Dropbox TLV • Coding while femaleMore From MediumBuilding your own MTurk-style app in R using Shiny+FlexdashboardEric Green in NiviBad API design — studying confusing AppsFlyer Server-to-server APIAlexey Strelkov in The StartupThe 439 day Journey that Changed my LifeDaniel Lemay in freeCodeCamp.orgThe Kubernetes Cluster Architecture SimplifiedLuisapreciado in Dev GeniusJava: Build Automation With MavenUday Chauhan in The StartupStrict Types in PHPJose Maria Valera Reales in The StartupBuilding Your Own WotsApp — Part 5Mark Lucking in Better ProgrammingHow to write a Recursive Function in Gomartin cartledge in Dev GeniusAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

Empresas mejoradas con software.,https://medium.com/@negocioskev/empresas-mejoradas-con-software-b05fe8f13d90?source=tag_archive---------7-----------------------,"Negocios,Digital Transformation,Digital,Software,Empresa","Las empresas que se apoyan en herramientas digitales tienen a mejorar su rendimiento.Las mejores empresas son aquellas que se adaptan rápidamente al cambio, en otras palabras las que tienen mejor tiempo de respuesta ante lo inesperado, se pueden llenar muchos libros con las maneras adecuadas de estar preparados, pero hay una verdad única, las empresas que se apoyan más en soluciones digitales en general tienen una ventaja competitiva.Uno pensaría que en la cultura de cualquier empresa la previsión al cambio es un patrón, pero esto es falso, buena parte de las empresas buscan adaptarse cuando ya han perdido su participación en el mercado, cuando no pueden mejorar su estructura de costos, o cuando simplemente es muy tarde.Blockbuster vs. Netflix.El caso Blockbuster es quizás uno de los mejores ejemplos de lo que puede pasar con una empresa cuando no se ajusta al cambio.Blockbuster llegó a controlar el 25% de la cuota de mercado mundial de videoclubes. En 2004 contaba con más de 9000 establecimientos a nivel mundial, esto sucedió por un excelente manejo de alquileres e inventario, su fundador David Cook optimizo estos procesos con sus conocimientos para la construcción de bases de datos (Era responsable de una empresa que desarrollaba software para la industria petrolera), con muchos procesos automatizados la empresa destacaba por ser eficiente.La empresa llegó a ser adquirida por la empresa Viacom por 7.700 millones de dólares en 1994, sin embargo ya la industria estaba empezando a cambiar, poco después en 1996 su valoración caería 50%.¿Cómo una empresa con más de 9.000 establecimientos, excelente reputación, y constante inversión cae? La respuesta no es muy difícil, Desde mediados de la década del 2000, Blockbuster no supo entender la obsolescencia del formato físico, ya en este punto la televisión por cable se había masificado, pero además en este año pasa un suceso curioso, Blockbuster tuvo la oportunidad de comprar Netflix por unos 50 millones de dólares, y pronto se arrepentirían de no haber concretado este negocioNetflix nace en 1997 en California, su modelo de negocio era muy novedoso, alquiler de DVD entregados por vía postal. Funcionaba con el alquiler en línea de películas, en esta empresa no había multas por entregas atrasadas, había un sistema muy diferente, que a los ojos de la industria era una locura, el cliente podía solicitar distintos títulos para alquiler, se enviaba el primer DVD, y para enviar el siguiente tenía que devolver el primero, Netflix aposto y gano, pero esto era solo una parte del plan, mientras la empresa tenía un sistema de referencias, los usuarios podían calificar las películas que alquilaban, como empresa entendían que estos datos podían ofrecerla la información que necesitaban para administrar sus recursos de la manera más rentable posible y no hay duda de que lo hicieron.Mientras Blockbuster apostaba más y más en su estrategia tradicional, que consistía en concretar tratos con las productoras de video, para obtener precios más competitivos, y ampliar su cadena de tiendas, pero ya en el 2004 esto no era suficiente, se desató una guerra de precios de DVD, Blockbuster no podía estar al día con esta porque sus costos operativos empezaban a ser altos, Viacom vendió la compañía, después de perder más de 300 millones de dólares, a Carl Icahn que creía que podía levantarla.En el 2007 James W. Keyes, anterior responsable de 7-Eleven, y ahora cabeza de Blockbuster centró todos los esfuerzos en reducir costes de administración, en salvar solo las tiendas físicas más rentables y en apostar por el alquiler de videojuegos, el problema es que esto aplazo el desarrollo de su propuesta de alquiler en línea, para cuando lanzaron Blockbuster Total Access​ el sistema de alquiler on-line, Hulu y Netflix ya le habían ganado terreno, y no consiguieron el impacto en el mercado que deseaban.En el 2007 Netflix lanza su plataforma de videos en línea, en un principio la visualización del catálogo electrónico era accesible solo a través de computadoras, pero la estrategia ya está hecha, en el 2008 la compañía buscó alianzas con diferentes empresas para incluir su app en consolas de videojuegos como X-Box de Microsoft o en reproductores de Blu-ray, para que estos dispositivos tuvieran acceso a su oferta, en el 2009 la aplicación se incluyó en algunas televisiones inteligentes, y para 2010 en otros aparatos que se conectaban a internet como el Nintendo Wii, la iPad, iPhone e iPod touch de Apple, ya era masivo, y el costo era muy bajo considerando la extraordinaria variedad que ofrecían, si notan el corazón de su estrategia estaba en el software.Mientras, el 23 de septiembre de 2010, Blockbuster declaró la bancarrota mediante el capítulo 11.​ En aquel momento aún quedaban abiertas más de 3.000 tiendas en Estados Unidos. A pesar de varios intentos por reestructurar su deuda, en marzo de 2011 el Departamento de Justicia de los Estados Unidos dictaminó que la empresa debía ser liquidada.Netflix actualmente también produce sus propias series y películas, trayendo una disrupción tan grande en la industria que actualmente está afectando incluso a los cines, Blockbuster es solo una atracción turística Bend, Oregón, un recordatorio de los viejos tiempos.¿Qué tal las empresas más pequeñas?Todo parte de los problemas que tengas, cuando observas la amplia oferta de soluciones digitales que existen empiezas a entender como facilitar muchos procesos. La pandemia fue un detonante para estos descubrimientos, pero es increíble lo mucho que se han resistido las empresas al cambio.Tenemos empresas que les cuesta intercambiar información entre ellos, debido a que no están en la oficina donde sus computadores contienen los archivos, cuando algo sencillo como una utilización eficiente de Google Drive bastaría para resolver este problema, además hay suficientes configuraciones de acceso y privacidad como para que se cree una infraestructura con base en esta herramienta.Pero a la par también hay herramientas que ayudan a obtener información de tus clientes, como los CRM, que te ayudan a clasificar y organizar tus prospectos y te brindan datos como tu CAC (costo de adquisición de clientes), o los Google Forms, desde donde puedes crear formularios de encuestas, y aprender lo necesario para mejorar tu producto. El sector de ventas es muchas veces tradicionalista en las empresas más pequeñas, piensan más en los clientes que ya tienen X ejecutivo, que en los que se pueden obtener con un cambio de estrategia, es una de las principales razones para no escalar.Actualmente hay tantas herramientas para digitalizar empresas que el reto debería ser no hacerlo, de hecho digitalizar te ayuda a mejorar el talento humano, no debes limitarte a una ciudad para reclutar los profesionales que necesitas, tienes el mundo completo disponible, esto es clave en el desarrollo de cualquier empresa, el talento humano te va a separar del montón.Los proceso del pasado pertenecen al pasado, no necesitas vallas en las autopistas, cuando la gente concentra su atención en sus celulares, y en este mundo digital puedes elegir con bastante precisión a que publico llegar, de hecho puedes calcular horarios de más tracción, y la información que tiene mejor impacto en el público. Obtienes mejores resultados, con menor esfuerzo.¿Qué tan perjudicial es mantenernos conservadores?El no poderte adaptar a tu ambiente ya es tóxico para tu empresa, quienes abrazan las soluciones vía software tienen canales para llegar a un mayor mercado, además tienen tendencia que sus canales de atención son más económicos, en primero lugar esto produce que tus servicios sean más competitivos, a corto plazo la empresa tradicional mantendrá su participación en el mercado por la fidelización, pero las nuevas generaciones empiezan a volverse mercado, y se empieza a recortar esto también, esto genera un bucle de deterioro con solo un final posible la extinción.Written byKevin HernándezSoy un asesor de negocios que se concentra en los nuevos métodos, un entusiasta de las criptomonedas y el libre mercado, encargado de educación en veinte.netFollowNegociosDigital TransformationDigitalSoftwareEmpresaMore from Kevin HernándezFollowSoy un asesor de negocios que se concentra en los nuevos métodos, un entusiasta de las criptomonedas y el libre mercado, encargado de educación en veinte.netMore From MediumDonald Trump Won, No Matter What Happens NextJessica Wildfire in The Apeiron Blog(Why) There Was no Biden Landslideumair haque in Eudaimonia and Co20 Things Most People Learn Too Late In LifeNicolas Cole in Better AdviceThe Election Should Never Have Been This Closeumair haque in Eudaimonia and Co“Anyone but Bernie”, They Said.Lauren Martinchek in Dialogue & DiscourseThis Is ‘I Wish a Motherf*cker Would’ Week for Black PeopleMarley K. in ZORAI Worked the Polls in Trump Country — and Left More Confused Than EverAaron Gell in GENAspirin May Treat Severe Covid-19 Disease, and That Tells Us Something ImportantMarkham Heid in ElementalAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
"Goodbye Reqs, How to Increase Value and Feedback Right Now",https://medium.com/dev-genius/say-goodbye-to-requirements-28f9a17f1012?source=tag_archive---------8-----------------------,"Software,Software Development,Software Engineering,Product Design,Product Management","There was a time, not long ago, where you had to get requirements. To develop software products, first, you had to go get the requirements. It was a necessity. It was just the way to do things.The requirements were a set of guidelines that told the team what to build. You would first have to figure all of these out, then you could start. The order of doing that, requirements, then building, was important. It could not be changed.If there were changes to the requirements, that meant the plan had to change. Thank goodness this inflexible process has alternatives. Agile, and flavors of it, have become strong contenders to this process. Agile brings a flexible approach, where you adjust to best meet the needs. It also brings tools to help figure out what needs to be built. By means of its principles and values.Requirements remain, even in newer processesHowever, requirements as a concept remain. Even in Agile processes. It is deeply embedded in software development practices. It is also a habit of use in most business cultures. Especially those not fully embracing Agile.Well, let’s get rid of the concept and the term! Let’s start fresh and use that start to focus on better ways. So come along with me and let’s figure out why you should make this change. Ditch the concept, forget about the term, and focus on better ways!Ditch the concept of requirementsBut why you askRequirements are too strict of a guideline. They do not offer the flexibility to adapt to ever changing business needs. They are thought of as a rigid definition of work to be done. This kills the creativity and problem-solving ability of the team. Which, hurts the solution created.Requirements make you believe there’s a Magic Bullet. A Magic Bullet for information that is needed. This Magic Bullet tells you what to do, you just have to find it. But in reality, there is no easy answer. You won’t find what has to be done hidden somewhere. Where you stumble across the answer. Instead, you must put in the effort. Ask questions of users and stakeholders. Put in the time to understand the needs. Only then will you get to the answers you need.Requirements impede discovery and experimentation. It’s interesting that requirements are affiliated with discovery. It’s often thought that you take on discovery to find the requirements. Associating requirements with discovery is a bit of a misnomer in my mind. As team members must do the research. They arrive at an understanding of needs and goals. Then they will create the solution. They do not discover the solution, least of all in requirements.The team does not discover a solution, least of all in requirements.Requirements imply that the work is known. Often the work is unknown and must be figured out along the way. The goals need to be understood. So the team can figure out how to meet those goals. IE, requirements are often thought to be the “what” and “how” of the work. However, the “what” needs to be understood by the team, so that the team can create the “how”. Meaning that the team needs to determine how best to meet goals and needs. It can’t be dictated in a requirement to them.False sense of security given from requirements. Having requirements often makes the team think that is the best way of doing things. They are given the requirement, and might not think creatively and critically about that solution. This can lead them to miss a better way, a better solution.How do you make the switchUnderstand that work to be done has to be determined. The team puts in the effort to understand needs and goals. They then work to them and fill in with needed detail as they go. Constant communication and collaboration with the users give the knowledge needed to build what’s needed.Be flexible and allow for changes. You do not know what you do not know. So you have to allow for the solution to evolve and grow over time. It will get to where you want it. It just doesn’t go directly from A to Z. It’s a process to get there.Remember to demo, and adjust based on feedback. Real feedback is key. It will tell you more than any requirement can, and will do so more quickly. Getting feedback from users is the fastest way for the team to learn and adjust. Which lets the team get to the finished solution faster.Dev GeniusCoding, Tutorials, News, UX, UI and much more related to developmentFollow18 Sign up for Best StoriesBy Dev GeniusThe best stories sent monthly to your email. Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

You can learn how to edit these software programs in one or two days.1. KdenLiveKdenLive in all likelihood looks closer to Vegas Professional or Premiere Professional than a number of the simplest free video editors.It’s a feature-rich NLE (or non-linear video editor) with many built-in options — however, not all things have been modernized.Kdenlive helps any format delivery, multitrack modification, customizable person interface, key frame results, transitions, 2D Tytler, audio and video scopes to aid in color and audio work and proxy-based modification!It is available on Windows Home and Linux — and if you want to compile the code yourself, it should run on Mac OS.Download2. OpenShotOpenShot is an extra of an easy to use video editor, designed to work on the only mission, however, it wouldn’t burden you with a very personal interface.I’ve found it to be very limiting to my advanced modifier desires. However, I know that many clients swear by the mandatory video modification.OpenShot helps unlimited tracks and edits, many audio, video and image codecs, many results, key frame animation, 3D animated titles, transitions and rhythm modifications.OpenShot can be obtained on Windows Home, Mac and Linux.DownloadAlso Read: 15 Best video editor apps for android3. OliveIt is Open source and is available for Windows Home, Mac and Linux. Olive is still at the beginning of the Alpha — however, she’s looking at the huge kids inside the video modification house, no less than the user interface, wanting exactly like the Premiere panel system, which is not a missing factor.Olive helps in modifying several tracks, a growing checklist of results, many export options and is constantly updating.I will control it and suggest that those with much less critical needs try it!They seem to be actively integrating suggestions and requests through GitHub, so now is the time to form this system.Download4. Avid Media ComposerFirst, we are now entering the big leagues.Avid Media Composer is the form of the king of normal Hollywood-level digital NLEs for a long time.While Remaining Minimize Professional X, Premiere Professional and DaVinciResolve are growing for some movies and TV works, Avid is something you want to know about a specialized subject.I used to evaluate tens of 1000 {dollars} to put Avid in a studio. They started to dedicate themselves to low cost individual licenses and even a free model with Avid Media Composer First.This comes with the total equipment of professional instruments for color gradation, image stabilization, advertising modification and so on.It has workflows with multiple cameras, audio banks, resignification capabilities and multiple audio instruments.This software program, however, only works on newer home windows and Mac machines.No help from Linux, unfortunately.DownloadWritten bySmartwiserhttps://smartwiser.com/ is one of the blogs in internet to share more information about technology.FollowVideo Editing SoftwareWindows 10WindowsEditingSoftwareMore from SmartwiserFollowhttps://smartwiser.com/ is one of the blogs in internet to share more information about technology.More From MediumProgramming Binary SearchRoman ElizarovImplementation of Sorting Algorithms in Pythonjagesh maharjan in delvifyStrategy and Decorator Design Patterns in RubyMicah ShuteFlask User Auth with Neo4jJosh-T in The StartupHow to Transit from PHP to Java and why it’s still worth itJohn Selawsky in Dev GeniusAngular Flex-Layout: Flexbox and Grid Layout for Angular ComponentSuguru Inatomi in Angular In DepthSetting up your Website with AWS S3, Route53 & CloudFrontChristian KreyStartups and the Production Readiness ProcessAl-Waleed Shihadeh in Better ProgrammingAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

Why I Decided To Learn Software Development,https://medium.com/@matt-trimner/why-i-decided-to-learn-software-development-28aba24346d?source=tag_archive---------11-----------------------,"Software Development,Software Engineering,Software","One of my fondest childhood memories getting a Nintendo 64 for Christmas. I remember constantly thinking about it. School days couldn’t end soon enough, running errands with my parents seemed to take forever. All I wanted to do was to sit at home and play.At the time, it was EXTRA exciting because not only was I six years old and everything was exciting, but video game systems were still quite new. It was my first time I saw something that could physically control the pictures on a screen.Around that time, my parents bought our first computer. I don’t remember much about it, except that one day we had a large desk and an eggshell colored PC tower sitting next to it. I don’t remember even knowing what it was, but we eventually learned that there was a bunch of games like Galaga, Snake, and a generic golf game loaded on it. That was all it took for me to want to spend as much time on it as possible.I wish I could say from that point on, my curiosity drove me to learn everything about computers, but that’s not the case. I grew up in a pretty small town with small schools that lacked resources (at the time I didn’t know this, but now that I’m older and work with high school students, it’s pretty apparent my old high school lacked in a lot of areas). We had computers for using Microsoft Word and sending emails, but we didn’t have any classes teaching any kind of basic technology. The most technical thing we ever did was find ways around the firewall so we could play browser games.That didn’t change much throughout college. I was always excited about technology, but more so from a consumer perspective than a creator perspective. I remember when the first iPhone came out, but you had to have an AT&T account in order to get one…I had Verizon. My roommate at the time had one and I would spend forever going through us the app store downloading every pointless app we thought was cool (it was the first app store, so everything was cool but most apps were pointless).Eventually, I received a bachelor’s degree in biology and went on to Chiropractic school. I’m really interested in all things related to physiology and performance, so it was the perfect path for me to take to start a professional career in the human performance world.I finished grad in December of 2016 and started my career. I work with all types of people from weightlifters, powerlifters, tennis players, as well as general population clients.Working with athletes was what I enjoyed, but working with the general population was what paid the bills. After a few years, I started getting bored doing the same thing every day and needed something challenging.One of my favorite things to do was look through PubMed, find studies related to whatever topic I was interested in at the time, then make Instagram videos explaining the topic. That eventually led me to start recording and editing a podcast.I also started watching some YouTube series’ on C++ and how to create a game engine. I had no clue what any of it meant or how it worked, but I just enjoyed watching people live-stream themselves working on projects and explaining how to solve problems. I also started really getting into videos on hardware and basic computer architecture.Over time, I started to get really serious when it came to technology, especially the software engineering part. Then, at the beginning of 2020 COVID 19 hit, and California enacted their safer at home orders.When Los Angeles shut down and I had extra time, I started doing Codecademy courses. This was my first experience actually coding on my own even though I had been watching other people do it on Youtube for almost a year prior. I fell in love with the problem-solving process and found myself thinking the CodeCademy courses constantly, just like when I was a kid and couldn’t wait to be home so I could play Nintendo.When it became clear the world was going to be very different because of COVID, I decided to make the best of it and change careers. I applied for the Flatiron software engineering boot camp and started at the earliest available date. My goal is to work in video game development and work on personal projects related to the training and performance space.Written byMatt TrimnerFollowSoftware DevelopmentSoftware EngineeringSoftwareMore from Matt TrimnerFollowMore From MediumPer My Last email: 5 Ways to Navigate the Corporate EnvironmentAlexandria Black-DavisHow I Overcame My Lack of Work Experience To Get the Job I WantedKarthik RajanHow to Lose Your Best Job ApplicantsMarne Platt in The InnovationIn 2019, focus on making a career out of the  lifestyle you prefer, not your passions.Josh HoffmanWhy “Older” Workers Can’t Land New JobsJennifer Anderson-Henry in The StartupA Startup Vet Reveals His Secrets to Assembling a Superstar DevOps TeamMatthew Halverson in Ship On Day OneWhat’s happening around the future of work: Drivers, trends, and opportunitiesLerer Hippeau in Lerer HippeauHow to measure achievement, instead of hoursAytekin Tank in The StartupAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
A short story by my AI friend,https://medium.com/@ivelinakrustevaagopyan/a-short-story-by-my-ai-friend-9cef55acb31b?source=tag_archive---------12-----------------------,"Artificial Intelligence,AI,Anxiety,Travel,Software","Being a software tester in my daily life I always approach things with curiosity and imagination, even if they are not an application or a complex system. Yet I couldn’t help but notice the multiple artificial intelligence apps and tools that come out almost every day now.Last time I played around with one of those it was extremely fun yet primitive. Or perhaps it was only fun because it was primitive. We had conversations like: “What’s your name?” — “I eat potatoes”.So just this week I decided to try a new app and give it another chance and discovered we can write a short story together. Who is we? Well, my AI friend and myself of course. Now I won’t be sharing details of which one is me and which one is her…it…the friend. I’ll let you decide for yourself. Enjoy.***I’ve been staying in the house for a while now. Sometimes I only realize it when I look outside and the sun beams hit my face like fast particles. It is strange how the world seems to be a whole lot darker out there than in the house. I’m ready for a change today. I don’t know where I’m going but I know I am. I have a little box I carry with me always. Inside of it is the only thing I care about — a small strawberry gold charm. It’s my only little trinket, I’m afraid to lose it. I put it safely inside my bag and fill the rest with some essential items and a cardigan. I head out.As I start walking the air gets thicker. Anxiety wants to hit me again but I don’t let it. I know how stress might seem so powerful sometimes but if you just wait a bit it goes away. I promise to myself that the next time I hear it, I’m going to laugh. I am five blocks into my random walk and my phone rings. It’s Val but I hang up. I put the phone on silent mode and keep going. It is a little windy today so I close my hood. I’m looking at all of the people around me — chatting, laughing, having a normal day out. A tiny bird chirps next to my foot, it’s warm wind comes from my side. I look at the bird and enjoy its presence. Birds are fascinating creatures. If a bird trusts you it’s everything. Maybe if I ignore it, the bird will go away. I reach for some bread sticks inside my bag and crush a few for the little guy to munch on. I look up at the sky. I close my eyes and take a deep breath of fresh air. Then I open them again and it’s decided — I am making a change, today. I smile at the little bird and give it some bread sticks. I look around until I spot a taxi. I get close and I see it’s available. I get inside and I freeze for a moment before giving the address. But then I say, “You know what, he is now ready for the journey”. I ask him to drive to the airport and I look back to see the street again. Everything is of course the same.I arrive at the airport, and he makes sure I am safely out of the car before driving away. I get to the flight board and just look. I’ve never felt so empowered really. I get to my seat and I am so happy and full of confidence. For the first time in my life I have the freedom and the money to just get on a plane and not having to get permission from anybody. I am so happy that I’m walking up to the girl next to me. I say to her: “I hope the weather will be good when we land.” Then I turn to the guy next to me and say, “I hope it’s not too cold for you in San Francisco.” At the connection airport we part ways and I decide I took almost nothing with me. But I didn’t need a lot anyways. I go to find my seat and am welcomed by a beautiful woman. My next and final stop would be Poland. I thought how I would be able to see new and beautiful places. Anxiety suddenly is replaced by excitement and expectation. I’m able to book a few days to explore the city. I walk around these new streets and I feel amazing, there is no fear and it’s not mundane. I am sure this is where I belong. At least for the next few days.Running away wouldn’t solve all of your problems. But it will give you the needed time out. To come to terms with all of your emotions.Written byIvyFollowArtificial IntelligenceAIAnxietyTravelSoftwareMore from IvyFollowMore From MediumThe Rideshare With a Happy EndingMelissa Toldy in EPISODICThe DoorJ M Jackson in The JunctionIt Changed That DayMichelle Renee KidwellI Noticed You Unfriended MeErnio Hernandez12.

Basics of Elasticsearch for Developer,https://medium.com/swlh/basics-of-elasticsearch-for-developer-a23de84c4b6?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Elasticsearch,Sofware Development,Software,Developer,Database","Elasticsearch has been used more and more in the software engineering, data and DevOps fields. In this post I will write about the basics of elasticsearch from developer perspective.So what is the definition of elasticsearch? according to elasticsearch’s website:Elasticsearch is a distributed, open source search and analytics engine for all types of data, including textual, numerical, geospatial, structured, and unstructured. Elasticsearch is built on Apache Lucene and was first released in 2010 by Elasticsearch N.V. (now known as Elastic). Known for its simple REST APIs, distributed nature, speed, and scalability, Elasticsearch is the central component of the Elastic Stack, a set of open source tools for data ingestion, enrichment, storage, analysis, and visualization. Commonly referred to as the ELK Stack (after Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana), the Elastic Stack now includes a rich collection of lightweight shipping agents known as Beats for sending data to Elasticsearch.Writing to ElasticsearchWhat happens if you insert a document to an index in elasticsearch? If you’re familiar with SQL and NoSQL databases, then you should know that there are many processes that happen when you insert a document into the database, one of reason of the processing is to optimize query speed. Same as other databases, there are also many processes that happen when you insert a document to elasticsearch, like determining field type, analyzing the text and in memory buffer system, but before that we need to know the most important thing when writing a data to elasticsearch, the Inverted IndexInverted IndexInverted index is the main thing that makes querying to elasticsearch blazingly fast. It is a data structure that maps term with its position in documents. For example when you are writing documents to elasticsearch like the following:Document 1: “Elasticsearch is fast”Document 2: “I want to learn elasticsearch”Here is what it would like in the inverted index:Now, every time you want to search “Elasticsearch” word then elasticsearch will looks into the term “Elasticsearch” in the inverted index and get the documents number from it.Field TypeJust like another search engine or repository, elasticsearch has a field or mapping type which is used when writing a document to it. Like the other repositories, the field type in elasticsearch is very important in determining how will it be stored in inverted index, which relates to how are we able to get the data from elasticsearch.You can insert mapping of field type by using elasticsearch’s mapping api, for example:curl -X PUT ""localhost:9200/my-index-000001?pretty"" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'{  ""mappings"": {    ""properties"": {      ""age"":    { ""type"": ""integer"" },        ""email"":  { ""type"": ""keyword""  },       ""name"":   { ""type"": ""text""  }         }  }}'If you don’t specify any mapping and insert a document to elasticsearch then by default elasticsearch will create the mapping for you. Please beware that it won’t be easy to change the mapping, so creating a mapping before inserting document to elasticsearch is recommended.One thing to note if you’re beginner to elasticsearch is regarding the difference between text and keyword field type. The difference is actually quite simple, but will have a lot of impact when we do query. Text field will be analyzed(explained later) and keyword will not. Basically text won’t be inserted to the inverted index like exactly you type, for example by default, “Hello, World” will be inserted as “hello” and “world. So if you plan to do exact match query with your field, keyword field type is recommended. One more thing that you should know: if you didn’t specify any mapping, then elasticsearch will map String type to both text type and keyword type which can be accessed by “field” and “field.keyword”If you want to learn more about the difference between text and keyword, you can read my other articleElasticsearch: Text vs. KeywordThe differences between them and how they behavemedium.comIn Memory BufferA single shard can consist of multiple segments and memory buffer. When a Document is inserted to elasticsearch, it will first go into memory buffer before becoming a segment in a process called “refresh”. The refresh process is working in a configurable interval with 1 second as its default. The documents that are not in the segment won’t be able to be searched. This refresh process means that elasticsearch is not real time search engine since inserted documents need to wait for refresh process.AnalyzerAnalyzer consist of series of processes that happen to sentences to documents before it got inserted to inverted index. The processes are consist of: Character Filters, Tokenizer, and Token Filter.Character Filters is the first process that happen in analyzer. It can be used for removing or replacing characters. For example, you can use Character Filter to filter out html tag, so things like <html>, <b>, <h1>, etc will be trimmed from the sentencesTokenizer is a process of separating sentences into words. For example if you index the sentence “Elasticsearch is fast”, then the tokenizer will split the sentence into “Elasticsearch”, “is”, and “fast”. Elasticsearch has many type of tokenizer, but the most common used is its default tokenizer, which is based on http://unicode.org/reports/tr29/.Token Filter is a process of transforming the words that came out from tokenizer, for example lowercasing the words.Reading from ElasticsearchQueryThere are many queries that you can do in elasticsearch, in this post I will explain some that I believe is important to know to people that is learning about elasticsearch for the first time. which are:Match All Query: this query will get all of the documents in the indexcurl -X POST \  'localhost:9200/index/_search' \  -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \  -d '{    ""query"":{        ""match_all"":{}    }}'Match Query: if you use Match Query, then your query will be analyzed before it get used to search the index. For example if you search “Hello, World” with Match Query, then your query will be become “hello” and “world” by default, note that if you have “Hello, World” in the inverted index it won’t be returned by elasticsearch, because your query is split.curl -X POST \  'localhost:9200/index/_search' \  -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \  -d '{    ""query"":{        ""match"":{            ""field"": {                ""query"": ""Hello, world""            }        }    }}'Term Query: similar with Match Query, but this time your query will not be analyzed. In previous example, if you’re search the index using Match Query with “Hello, World” as query and you have “Hello, World” document in the index then the document won’t be returned by elasticsearch, but with Term Query, it will be returned because the query is searched as it is.curl -X POST \  'localhost:9200/index/_search' \  -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \  -d '{    ""query"":{        ""term"":{            ""field"": {                ""query"": ""Hello, world""            }        }    }}'Bool query: If you want to combine queries, then you can use this one, there are 4 types of boolean query: Must, should, must_not and filter.curl -X POST \  'localhost:9200/index/_search' \  -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \  -d '{  ""query"": {    ""bool"": {      ""must"": [        {          ""match"": {            ""field"": {              ""query"": ""Hello, world""            }          }        },        {          ""term"": {            ""field"": {              ""query"": ""Hello, world""            }          }        }      ]    }  }}'AggregationsElasticsearch has a powerful aggregation function compared to other databases. The simplest form of aggregation that elasticsearch can do is to bucket(group) documents, you might think that other databases can do bucketing with simple query too, but what’s so great about elasticsearch aggregation is that you can create a nested aggregation.For example, this is one of the simplest aggregation in elasticsearch, range aggregation:curl -X GET ""localhost:9200/_search?pretty"" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'{  ""aggs"": {    ""price_ranges"": {      ""range"": {        ""field"": ""price"",        ""ranges"": [          { ""to"": 100.0 },          { ""from"": 100.0, ""to"": 200.0 },          { ""from"": 200.0 }        ]      }    }  }}'will produces{  ...  ""aggregations"": {    ""price_ranges"": {      ""buckets"": [        {          ""key"": ""*-100.0"",          ""to"": 100.0,          ""doc_count"": 2        },        {          ""key"": ""100.0-200.0"",          ""from"": 100.0,          ""to"": 200.0,          ""doc_count"": 2        },        {          ""key"": ""200.0-*"",          ""from"": 200.0,          ""doc_count"": 3        }      ]    }  }}There are many more aggregations that elasticsearch can do, which you can read in their documentation.Those are all things that I think you should know if you’re just started learning elasticsearch. I plan to write about the practical use and the high-availability about elasticsearch in another post. so, see you there :)The StartupMedium's largest active publication, followed by +723K people.

How to easily implement Nextcloud’s End-to-End-Encryption,https://medium.com/@oliverpifferi/how-to-easily-implement-nextclouds-end-to-end-encryption-358868d9347e?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Nextcloud,Apple,Private Cloud,Privacy,Software","The feature itself has been there for quite some time now but was always considered as experimental. Now, combining the 3.x-clients and Nextcloud Hub 19, you are finally able to make data and files accessible from your desktops or mobile apps only. Technically, it is encrypted on the one side, being put on your Nextcloud storage (aka. the server) and from this stage on made available to the other side, meaning each supported client can gain access to this data. The storage on the server is used to contain the files nevertheless but being locked out „in the middle“ so you should consider which data needs to be encrypted from end-to-end as using your Nextcloud-instance from the web only won’t help you here.Enabling the End-to-End-EncryptionYou may have stumbled on this app before but as it was flagged as „experimental“ there was the advice not to use it in production environments simultaneously. Now just head to your Nextcloud App-area while being logged in as an administrative user, download and enable the app. Don’t mix this app up with the server-side-encryption which does exactly this, encrypting your whole Nextcloud-storage on a per-server-basis without the End-to-End-features. That’s it from the server-side.Just download and enable the app from Nextcloud’s App Store!Taking care of the clientsIn my daily usage scenario in the team of Cupertino, I updated my apps on macOS 10.15 „Catalina“ and iOS 13.7 to the latest release which officially supports the now polished end-to-end-encryption. Once the apps have discovered we have activated the feature in Nextcloud’s backend, it will tell us that End-to-End-encryption is supported here.We may now activate the feature on the specific client which will lead us to an appearing, individual passphrase („mnemonic“). This passphrase is used once we tell another client to activate the encryption feature so write it down, copy it to your own password manager — but remember it!Put that phrase down somewhere!The iOS-app doesn’t differ that much although a specific prerequisite must be met: The app-lock, either by a PIN or Face/Touch-ID, needs to be activated first. Then, the encryption (here still flagged as „experimental“) can be activated as well. Once this is done, the „mnemonic“ the first client issued us when activating the E2E-feature for the first time needs to be entered and — et voilà — the mobile client participates from the encrypted files as well!Taking care of E2E on iOSEncrypting folders and filesWhile I haven’t figured out how to encrypt existing folders (the client shows neither a reaction nor an error) the best-practice seems indeed to create a new folder, leave it empty as it is and right-click from within the Nextcloud-client on this folder. The option to „Encrypt“ will appear and once clicked, a green lock should appear after a few seconds showing that the encryption is done.Click to encrypt!Once this step has been accomplished, you may now put your desired files into the folder, build your specific folder tree and store all related files in it — the encryption will do the rest.Mission / encryption accomplished!When venturing to this folder from Nextcloud’s web interface, the folder will be marked with a lock as well and the contents are — you may have guessed it — not readable.Missing accomplished!Not much to read here, thanks to the E2E!The verdictThe implementation of the End-to-End-Encryption within Nextcloud as been an experimental feature for quite some time and still today, it’s not as trivial as it should be — enabling the app is just barely the half of the job. With the clients on macOS, Windows and Linux and iOS as well as Android, Nextcloud closed the circle and made this feature available in its (stable) whole. As always, it should be considered which stuff really needs to be encrypted, especially if you use Nextcloud on a web basis mostly once your classic clients aren’t at hand.In the end, you have successfully made use of Nextcloud’s End-to-End-encryption feature and your working device equipped with the Nextcloud 3.x-app! While this tutorial is focused on the Apple-environment, you won’t encounter much differences when venturing through the client-worlds of Windows, Linux and Android!Written byOliver PifferiDad.

Advantages of a Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC),https://medium.com/faun/advantages-of-a-secure-software-development-life-cycle-sdlc-e5011bf19ba8?source=tag_archive---------2-----------------------,"Secure,Software Development,Software,Sdlc,Cybersecurity","Photo by ThisisEngineering RAEng on UnsplashMost organizations have an SDLC process in place that helps them streamline their development process. However, the rising complexity and number of business risks associated with insecure applications have made it necessary to integrate security into all the stages of the software development life cycle (SDLC), thus making it a secure SDLC.Moreover, attackers are increasingly becoming more sophisticated in the ways they exploit security vulnerabilities and attack businesses. Cyberattacks are now more difficult to trace, let alone address.Companies are adopting a secure software development life cycle approach to detect and mitigate security threats. As such, it is not limited to only developers or the security team. Cross-functional teams can easily adopt a secure SDLC mechanism in order to facilitate better security across various stages of the SDLC.Let’s take a look at what a secure software development life cycle (SDLC) really means and why you should consider adopting one.What is a Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)?A secure software development lifecycle (SSDLC) is a framework that defines the entire development process to build a software product while integrating security at all stages — right from the planning, to the design, development, testing, and deployment stage.Typically, secure software development lifecycle processes are divided into the following stages:Phase 1: Requirement Collection and AnalysisSecurity requirements for the software application are established during this stage. Security experts analyze the key security risks within the application such as functionality, type of information application being used, etc. It also includes an internal security risk assessment and audit to avoid future conflict.Phase 2: DesignDuring this stage, security is built into the design of the software application. We perform threat modeling where there are primarily four stages: decomposing the application, categorizing, prioritizing, and mitigating security risks. We also design the countermeasures to address security threats identified and address the security requirements.Phase 3: DevelopmentIn the development phase, we ensure that code is developed securely using security controls identified during the design phase. Organizations also host training sessions for developers to understand the secure software development life cycle better and enable them to perform unit testing of security features of the application. Also, the code of the developers is reviewed to ensure their code does not introduce security vulnerabilities.Phase 4: TestingOnce the application is in the testing phase, it is checked to ensure that it meets security standards and in-depth security testing is performed including penetration testing, integration testing, further static code analysis, dynamic analysis, etc.Phase 5: Deployment & MaintenanceIn the deployment phase, all security controls are checked once more, secure code review (static analysis), dynamic, configuration, container security, etc. and it is finally deployed. After that, continuous monitoring and mitigation programs are run to identify security vulnerabilities in running applications and address them in a timely manner.Importance Of a Secure Software Development Life CycleAs enterprises compete to stay ahead of their competition, they aim to deliver rapid software program releases to their customers with state-of-the-art features. Coming up with innovative solutions and developing them alone is a big challenge in itself, let alone making sure that the software is secure.Instead of just performing security testing at the end, right when the pressure’s high and you’re closing in on your deadline, it’s much better and easier to embed security into all stages. Contrary to popular belief, which is that security holds back the development process, a secure SDLC is an efficient and effective way to bake security into different stages of the development process.It brings together all the stakeholders involved in the project to ensure that the software application is secure.Developers can begin by educating themselves with the best secure coding practices and frameworks available for better security. They should also consider using automated tools to quickly identify security risks in the code.In addition to this, the management team can also leverage a secure SDLC to design a strategic approach for a more secure product. For instance, they can perform a gap analysis to understand what policies/activities currently exist in their organization and their effectiveness.Setting up security policies that not only help you with high-level concerns like compliance but also allow you to embed it at the most basic level is necessary. If this sounds overwhelming, you can hire security experts who can assess your security needs and devise a roadmap that helps your organization enhance your security.Top Advantages of a Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)There are countless advantages of using a secure software development life cycle. Here are some of the top ones that you should know about.Early identification of security vulnerabilities helps reduce costs to implement security controls and mitigation processes of vulnerabilities. The security vulnerabilities are fixed during the development process, instead of deploying patching software, which is much more costly when compared to addressing the problem in real-time during the SDLC.Another advantage of secure SDLC is it helps build a culture of security that is more likely to catch issues not only in development but in other areas of an organization as well.Since security is integrated right from the design stage in a secure SDLC, important security decisions are documented before development begins. Both the management and development team are aware of the security risks and concerns related to the project. This, in turn, helps fine-tune the development strategy to ensure secure code is built as the SDLC progresses.One of the major advantages of a secure SDLC is that it helps in the overall reduction of intrinsic business risks for the organization. Whether it’s common security attacks like SQL or XML injections, or critical security issues like DoS (denial of service), companies that fall victim to cybersecurity attacks tend to lose a lot more than anticipated.Data breaches can lead to damaged market reputation, stock value, weak customer relationships, reduced customer retention rates, and decreased sales. A secure SDLC helps prevent most security vulnerabilities in a timely manner, thereby protecting an organization from several cyberattacks.Is a Secure Software Development Life Cycle Right for You?Adopting a secure software development life cycle is the need of the hour. We understand that projects and applications have advanced and complex features, but security is no longer optional or even a bottleneck for your development process.Our security teams identify where and how security vulnerabilities can impact your software and applications. While you focus on your operations and delivery, we take care of the “secure” part of your SDLC for your projects.At Cypress Data Defense, we focus on integrating security into all stages of the SDLC to ensure you don’t face the wrath of cybersecurity attacks and lose out on your customers’ data.We perform threat modeling, create security test cases, conduct penetration testing, and other tests throughout the SDLC process. By leveraging automated tools and working with expert security testers, we work efficiently and help you cut costs for your projects.

A Manifesto for Live & Sharable Data,https://codeburst.io/a-manifesto-for-live-sharable-data-4869362dfea5?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"Data,Decentralization,Collaboration,Software","The ‘truth’ should be the data that is being used, not the data in distant storage.Distribute the data automatically, with the guarantee that all of it will converge on the same ‘truth’.Use a published open standard for encoding data with its meaning, and communicating changes to it.Hi, I’m George. This year I left my day job as a software engineering leader and plunged into lockdown under a mountain of work, uncertainty, and risk. Last week, I pushed the button to launch the m-ld Developer Preview. The period between now and when lockdown began has been a mad journey filled with moments of creativity, anxiety, frustration, imposter syndrome, fight and flight urges, elation and time-dilation, and so! much! coffee!The WhyAs a data management app developer, I’ve used many ways to encode and store data. Frequently, they are combined in the same architecture with one of the locations becoming known as the ‘central truth’:While the specific technologies vary, the overall pattern is very common. Motivations include properties of security, integrity, consistency, operational efficiency, and cost. However, there are some other peculiar properties that stand out:The ‘truth’ is on the far right-hand side; but the data is being used throughout, with the particular value being realized on the left.The software application is responsible for both distributing the data and for operating on it.Every encoding syntax is specific to a technology and does not expose the data’s meaning enough to be independently understood.The main consequence of these properties is application code complexity. We have to be incredibly careful to maintain an understanding of the code as to how current (how close to the truth) our copy of the data is. We must then operate on the data accordingly, and share the understanding with other components. This is hard and frequently goes awry; resulting in software bugs that are very hard to reproduce, let alone fix.In this blog, I’ll argue that — with recent advances in computer science — we can make improvements to this for many applications. Applying our manifesto, we want our architecture to look more like this:The HowOne thing to notice in the centralized data pattern is that we’re taking each encoding of the data and translating it into a new one so as to make it suitable for either computation, storage, added security, or for any other reason. At each translation, the complexity of keeping the new encoding up-to-date with the previous ones ramps up.But what if we did away with the idea of re-encoding the current data, and instead transacted in changes? Humans do this naturally. When having a conversation about some information, we don’t re-state it every time we want to adjust it. We refine information by discussing the delta between the old and the new. And we naturally switch between re-statement and deltas as required.This concept is nothing new in software either — event-driven architectures have been a common paradigm since at least the mid-2000s. But consumers of ‘events’ have a new problem: to apply the change to their encoding of the current data. This distributes logically duplicate program code to every consumer — and lines of code are at least linearly proportional to bugs. Even worse, the event ordering is critical so the coordination of the totally ordered log of events becomes the new centralized ‘truth’ (and a literally bigger one).Let’s deal with the code duplication issue first. Being good engineers we take care not to repeat ourselves but this becomes hard to do when re-stating something in different languages. So, what if we had a common language for data? One that could express both state and changes to state? Since we’re here, let’s have one in which we can encode the meaning of the data, per our manifesto, that includes a natural way to identify data universally. And further, can we have one for which native, widely-available, battle-hardened database engines exist so that sometimes we don’t have to translate anything at all?Sounds like a big ask. Luckily, academia and industry have been working on it for some time. But let’s look at the other problem: change ordering.Change OrderingImagine if you shared some information with a friend and then every thought you had about it couldn’t start until your friend finished whatever thought they were having about it. This is the strictest way that centralized data management systems maintain consistency.To mitigate the impact of this on the fluency of data manipulation, there are various strategies available including fine-grained locking, optimistic locking, and a choice of transaction isolation levels. These have various merits, but each of them re-introduces some of the very distributed application complexity we were trying to reverse, and they still require the central ordered log. What if we went the other way, and just removed the ordered log entirely?There are two approaches to concurrency control that don’t need a total ordering of changes. One is called Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs), and the other Operational Transformation (OT). These do provide the required guarantee that copies of the data will converge to the same ‘truth’. But they don’t remove the possibility that concurrent changes will disagree with each other and lead to a ‘truth’ that doesn’t make sense.But wait, you and your friend had no trouble refining your shared information, with no deterministic coordination whatsoever. How? Humans employ myriad strategies for coordination. You withhold thoughts while someone else is talking. You undo and redo thoughts against new information, both before and after expressing them. You notice conflicts that corrupt the information or render it illogical, apply obvious resolutions, and negotiate others. You actively seek consensus or delegate decisions.In the case of document editing, we can go further and notice that given a foundational level of concurrency control in the software — Google Docs uses OT — editing by multiple humans works fine and doesn’t require much explicit coordination at all. Research groups have found that this applies just as well to CRDTs.ConclusionThere are many finer details to explore in practice but we have established that our manifesto can be met, in principle, with the application of current computer science. The approach that we’ve taken with m-ld is to provide a protocol, with implementing engines, for distributing data in a distributed application. Here is how m-ld realises the manifesto for live and sharable data:The ‘truth’ is the data exposed to the app by the engine.The data is automatically distributed by the engine with the guarantee that all engines will converge on the same ‘truth’.We use an open standard for encoding data with its meaning, and communicating changes to it.For now, we’re proving out the tech and filling out the corners that we think are essential for collaboration and autonomy use-cases. But we think we’re onto something important to data architectures in general.And we’d love to hear what you think. If you’re ready to try m-ld out, you can work with the Developer Preview right now. Let us know what you’re building!Icons by xnimrodx from flaticon.com.

Expanding the Product,https://medium.com/wholeprodteam/expanding-the-product-b8ee539f3149?source=tag_archive---------4-----------------------,"Product Management,Creativity,Software,IoT","Photo by Diana Parkhouse on UnsplashPrior to joining Klaviyo, I started my career at Lutron, where we designed and built smart building systems: Imagine pulling up to your dream house in your dream car — we made the lights fade on with your presence, the shades roll up, and the house come to life. Such systems required specialized software to design, which was the product I worked on. I’d like to share some lessons I learned in my first years working in Product.As a fresh engineer-turned Product Manager, my view of the product was shaped by those around me: the customers, the engineers, the designers, and the business leaders. Everyone had endless lists of demands and wishes, and I kept busy learning the basics of defining, building, and releasing features.It was fun to work through challenging customer problems and come up with clever and delightful solutions. However, as time went on, I couldn’t help but wonder where we were taking our product, the best-in-class design studio for commercial IoT systems. Our customers raved about our software as a key differentiator in our whole product experience. We were ahead of our competition, which meant that we couldn’t simply look to others and imitate.A Backlog-Driven RoadmapWe all have endless lists of features and bugs.For a while, our roadmap was driven by our stakeholder-made backlog. We had lists of prioritized features from each of the business units we supported. We divided our efforts based on per-stakeholder budgets — department A gets 70% of our bandwidth, department B gets 10%, and so on. We let the powerful stakeholders negotiate their shares. While we did the legwork to conduct the user research and create the JIRA tickets, these stakeholders more or less defined their chunks of the roadmap, and we simply stitched them together so that we were delivering something nice for every stakeholder in each release.This model worked well for some people. The stakeholders were happy because they pretty much dictated what they got in each release. The engineers were happy because there was great visibility into what came next. Overall, there was a sense of predictability and complacency, which to many was preferable to ambition and chaos.But complacency is dangerous. I knew that this mode of working could go on for a long time because it was comfortable. I also knew that incrementally polishing our product wasn’t going to keep us the industry leader, let alone set us up for breakthroughs. It was only a matter of time before someone disrupted us.We needed to expand our product beyond iterating within its box.Expanding HorizontallyThe first thing we did was to take our existing advantage into an adjacent market. Our tool already excelled at designing complex IoT systems, and our company had an unfair advantage over most competitors: we offered Total Light Management — not only did we control artificial light, we also automated daylight management via motorized shades and networked sensors. After all, the human need is to control light and ambiance, regardless of the source of emission.Traditionally, commercial lighting and shading solutions were 2 separate verticals. Differences in the whole process from specification to buying to installation dictated that there were 2 distinct groups of decision makers often buying from 2 different manufacturers. On the shading side, people were primarily relying on generic tools like Excel and PDF editors to do their job, which can be so cumbersome and error-prone that unless there was a high probability of winning, people didn’t even bother putting in a quote. We set out to change that, and our software was a key tool to enable this change.Our product was made to automate the lighting system design process, and was not made to support shading. When we analyzed the architecture of our product against the requirements of the new market, it was clear that we had a momentous opportunity:The needs of the 2 markets heavily overlapped (after all, they were working on the same buildings and underlying systems) even though they were often separate businesses. Our software was great at handling the fundamental needs of building design, and it was a matter of adding support for new product components and adapting existing features.Of course, the actual planning and execution held far more lessons, but the overall strategy paid off. We not only enabled existing users to sell what was once two separate solutions in one package (which was a compelling edge, saving money and time for all parties involved), but also helped the company transform our sales channels thanks to the easy-to-use automations that democratized the design of shading systems. It was pretty cool to see new businesses and careers made possible by our product.Expanding VerticallyAs time went on and I had the opportunity to learn more deeply about our customers through many on-site visits (which I strongly argue is the best and most valuable way to learn from customers), I started to think beyond adapting our tools to serve previously underserved industries and audiences.When we examined our customer journey maps, we noticed that many of our users were executing repetitive tasks because there were distinct stages, stakeholders, and needs in their journey. For each stage, they preferred specific tools to optimize their workflow: they’d rather do duplicate work later once the job is won than invest time early on when the risks are too great. We mapped out their software stack over the course of their job cycle.An oversimplified view of our users’ tech stackEach of our customers figured out their own stack. Some learned the tricks from a previous job, some went to trainings and industry events, some experimented endlessly to hack together unique automations. By visiting and interviewing many users, a common pattern emerged along with a set of JTBDs (jobs to be done). Since construction, like many other disciplines, is fundamentally an iterative process going from coarse concepts to detailed implementations, this scattered approach was inherently wasteful. Our customers were forced to trade off long-term efficiency for short-term risk aversion. Lots of work was done with disconnected, proprietary tools (if I had a dollar for each time I saw a complicated Excel template…), and most of the work ended up thrown away because there was no simple path to transfer existing work into the next tool in the process.This was an opportunity for us to redefine their stack.An oversimplified view of our customers’ tech stack after our updateWe used the overall customer journey as our guide, not just the parts that touched our product. We looked at the whole stack, and asked ourselves how we could make working within our ecosystem even easier than working with their current shortcut tools of choice.The result was a one-stop solution for quoting, designing, and programming large-scale commercial IoT systems. We dramatically reduced the time and knowledge required to adopt our tools, and changed the software stack for many of our customers. In fact, our tool did so well that some people started “stealing” it to create competitor solutions — because even with the overhead of translating system designs, our product was still far superior than the alternatives. While that was a whole separate issue, it put a smile on our faces. We knew we had done something right.Along the way, we also came up with some pretty radical ideas around rearchitecting our systems and completely redefining the logic and models behind our software, which opened the door to a whole new paradigm for automated design solutions. But that is a story for another day.A Roadmap-Driven BacklogNo longer were we simply executing on the wishlists of our stakeholders who divvied up our bandwidth; We listened to our customers and strategically set our roadmap to deliver more impact. Our vision drove the backlog, not the other way around. This is part of our jobs as PMs. After all, “it’s not the customer’s job to know what they want.”Setting the roadmap is part science, part art. The above is just a simple mental model I used to expand my product and make quantum leaps in the impact we delivered.Look horizontally, and you’ll see “adjacent” verticals where your product’s unique advantages can translate nicely and enable something that people in those markets had never seen.Look vertically, and you’ll discover opportunities to simplify your customers’ workflows and deliver compelling value beyond the original scope of your product.wholeprodteamProduct @ KlaviyoFollow376 1 Product ManagementCreativitySoftwareIoT376 claps376 claps1 responseWritten byHansen LiangFollowProduct manager, designer.

Alfred Advanced Skills,https://medium.com/@saneryee-studio/alfred-advanced-skills-11dc84fd8772?source=tag_archive---------5-----------------------,"Technology,Mac,Software,Productivity,Apple","Alfred LogoIn the article 4 Apps Must Install On Your Mac for Development in 2020, I briefly introduce the Alfred App and some of its key features. From the feedback of the comments, they praise Alfred as a very useful app. This article will continue to introduce some advanced tips for using Alfred to boost our productivity. These include:Customize searchAlfred WorkflowsYou need to buy a license to use these functions. Compared to the benefits of these features, I think the cost is worth it.Customize SearchFor web search, Alfred provides quick searches for some commonly used websites by default, you can check it in the preferences.Web Search SettingsAdd Custom SearchYou can add your own frequently used searches. For example, the most commonly used website for programmers — stackoverflow. When we search on stackoverflow, we will get the following URL address: https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=swift.Search URL of stack overflowHere swift string to number is the search keyword, then replace it with {query} in curly brackets. This is the Search URL we need. Just add it to the custom search.https://stackoverflow.com/search?q={query}.Click Add Custom Search and fill in the modified URL above into the Search URLTitle: What is displayed in the results when you use your keyword. Here is Search stackoverflow for '{query}' .Keyword: The keyboard shortcut you want to use to call up this custom search. I set it as so here.Encode query using UTF8: This option helps if you’re using non-standard characters. Try ticking it if your query didn’t work the first time.icon: You can add the website’s logo here for easy identification.Add custom searchNow only use the shortcut key (I set to double-click Command) to activate Alfred, and then enter so (keyword) and the content to be searched in stackoverflow, finally press Enter. It’s so efficient and simple.Search in stack overflowThere are more custom search examples:Search Quora.com: https://www.quora.com/search?q={query}Search Reddit.com: https://www.reddit.com/search?q={query}Search Apple Developer Documentation: https://developer.apple.com/search/index.php?q={query}Search scikit-learn: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/search.html?q={query}Alfred WorkflowsAlfred Workflows can be thought of as the Shortcuts App (Shortcuts is a scripting application for iOS that allows users to create macros for executing specific tasks on their device) of the Mac version. With Alfred’s workflows you can extend Alfred and get things done in your own way. Replace repetitive task with workflows, and boost your productivity.In the previous article, I briefly introduced the date calculation workflows.Date calculation workflowsIn this section, I will introduce more useful workflows and teach you how to create your own workflows.How to create workflowsTake the Workflows — Writing I created as an example. This Workflow can quickly help me enter the writing mode. Its trigger keyword is “write”, and Alfred will help me activate Google Translate, Medium drafts page, and Spotify. After the execution is complete, it returns a notification “Please writing! Have a nice day!” (You need you to turn on “Allow Notifications from Alfred” in the system notifications settings).Writing WorklfowsMy Writing EnvironmentSpecific steps are:First, select the trigger method, the main trigger methods are Hotkey and Keyword. Here I trigger workflow through the keyword “write”.Then select the actions to be performed after the trigger. The action I used is to Launch Apps. The actions supported by Alfred Workflow included Open URL, System Command, Run Script, Terminal Command, etc. We can implement many complex tasks through scripts and combine actions.Finally, Output. I added a notification. Alfred provides other output options, such as sound, copy to clipboard, Large Type.Here is just a simple example. Through learning and debugging, you can create a personalized workflow that meets your needs.If you don’t want to create a workflow yourself, the Alfred Workflow community provides many excellent workflows. You can share your workflows with the community.Below are a few workflows I recommend:Spotify Mini Player (Alfred 4)The Mini Player gives you control over the Spotify app on your Mac. Find albums, search for artists & play songs to groove to. Control your Spotify library at your fingertips.Spotify Mini PlayerSpotify Mini Player featuresDash (bundled into Dash app)Add a blisteringly fast search of the Dash documentation / API browser app. with in-line results and responsive integration.Type “dash” followed by a search term relevant to the documentation sets you’re using in Dash and you’ll see Dash update itself blisteringly fast based on what you typed into Alfred!Dash + Alfred = Ultimate Weapon for developerAlfred Workflows in DashEncode / DecodeEncoding and decoding a string into multiple variations.EncodeDecodeNetwork InfoDisplays the local IP addresses for all network interfaces (including VPN tunnels) and the external IP address. Displays the MAC addresses for all network interfaces. Each network interface displayed includes the device name.DecodeShow mac addressTimezonesA customized world clock — shows a list of user-configured cities with their current local times.Timezones listAlfred mldocs ( Alfred 4)Alfred Workflow for TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Statsmodels API DocsAlfred mldocsYou’ll find hundreds more on Packal, a brilliant user-created repository for workflows, and on Alfred Forum, where you’ll find help in creating your own workflows.ConclusionSince purchasing Alfred Powerpack Lisence, I have been using my Alfred more and more often. Although each Alfred action only saves me a few steps, a few seconds. But if we use it for a long time, the time it saves for us is considerable.Usage of My AlfredOne More ThingRegarding Alfred’s future, I guess it is likely to be acquired by Apple. Then merge the Alfred search function into Spotlight, and the Alfred Workflows become Shortcuts for the Mac version. The predecessor of the Shortcuts was named Workflow, and Apple acquired it in 2017.If it happens, the good thing for us is Alfred will be free.From Alfred to Mac ShortcutsWritten byJason ZhangSoftware Engineer, Technical Writer, Kaggle Competitions Expert | Travel, Sci-Fi Movies & Series, SportsFollow31 31 31 TechnologyMacSoftwareProductivityAppleMore from Jason ZhangFollowSoftware Engineer, Technical Writer, Kaggle Competitions Expert | Travel, Sci-Fi Movies & Series, SportsMore From MediumUpdateHub: Sending OTA Updates using the Yocto ProjectOtavio Salvador in O.S.

Aerial view of technology,https://medium.com/@manpreet.singh/aerial-view-of-technology-bebff21485c0?source=tag_archive---------6-----------------------,"Technology,Learning,Public Speaking,Thought Leadership,Software","Photo by Enes on UnsplashWhenever I get the chance to fly a drone, it amazes me. A drone gives an aerial view of almost everything around — a park full of trees and kids playing, traffic in the city moving from one place to another, idle cars in the parking of shopping plaza, people relaxing on the beach, high rise with excellent architecture marvel, etc. It enhances knowledge about the city. If that drone is flown along with a couple of friends, one or another friend has unique experiences in a place visible in the aerial view. This sharing of experience enriches the whole experience and widens the horizon. And once I have the aerial view, I can make up my mind on what excites me from distance and drive to that place to catch a close glimpse of the same. It is simply a wonderful experience then since I entered a new place without it seeming that new.If I draw parallels in our areas of work. Most of the time we put the effort into our area of work, without much knowledge about things in other areas of work. So in a way, most of us have developed ourselves in our niche area of work and don’t look outside most of the time. E.g. if a person is working in cloud technology development, he/she might hardly look for anything in autonomous cars or any other area of work. But is it right or wrong? I think it is a matter of perspective.For a few who would like to understand other areas of work, sometimes don’t have the time or discipline to explore other areas. Or don’t feel engaged unless someone who has explored that area tells them what it is or shares experiences. More like the drone example which I mentioned above. i.e. If someone can give me an aerial view and share experiences of a particular area at a high level, it would really help me in making a choice if that is the area I would like to take the plunge. With this same mindset, one day my friend and colleague from Computer Associates reached out to me. His name is Haris Kilikotu. Haris suggested a focus group meeting every week. While we were talking about this, we came up with the structure of the meetings:Every meeting would have a theme associated with it. A theme like autonomous cars, SOLID design principles, 3d printing, Kubernetes, cloud security, content generation, AI, etc.Each meeting would have a keynote speaker on a topic related to the theme. It could be that the keynote speaker is experienced in that topic. Or it could be that the speaker has spent a couple of days preparing for that topic.And finally, each meeting would have a discussion section, where the discussion moderator would put forth intriguing questions related to the theme of the meeting.We decided to keep it as only a one-hour meeting every Sunday. More like a weekly capsule of knowledge about some other area of work, weekly aerial view of some other technology. We named the group as techBLENDtechBLEND primarily works on below principles:Build thought leadership in technology spaceListening about other technologies and experience of the speaker in that technology space helps in widening the horizon. And hence helps in building thought leadership in technology space. It could also be possible that what I learn in other areas of work could also be applied in my area of work. More like cross-pollination.Become better speakerKeynote speaker, discussion moderator, or members would learn a thing or two about public speaking skills while talking and discussing technologies in a diverse group of people whom they don’t know from their area of work.Break monotonyWe know prolonged working in an area of work becomes monotonous at times. Just a weekly discussion in some other area of work freshens up the person and breaks the monotony. And it could be also possible that other areas of work might interest that person so much, that he/she goes deeper into it and eventually switches the area of work.It has been phenomenal use of my one hour every week. Learning new things, knowing new experiences, and that too without any financials associated with it. And in case I land up in becoming a keynote speaker or discussion moderator for a meeting, I spend more time preparing for the meeting and hence learning new things. Overall a beautiful journey over the last 3 months. Hoping it continues for years to come and enriches the lives of members.Written byManpreet SinghFollow49 1 49 49 1 TechnologyLearningPublic SpeakingThought LeadershipSoftwareMore from Manpreet SinghFollowMore From MediumThis Is Your FightMaggie Levantovskaya in The StartupWorking remotelyMisha Szulczewski in ScalacMIT Economist Tracks Shifting Job TrendsMIT IDE in MIT Initiative on the Digital EconomyWho Wants to Read a Novel in Email?Allison Ditmer in ILLUMINATIONTechnical Writing: Practical & Theoretical Advicesoshace.com in The StartupHow I Became an Advertising Copywriter (with no experience)Mitch FodstadEmotional Intelligence and WorkIrene Cagnoni in The StartupT Shaped PeopleCaleb MeredithAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Prerequisites,https://medium.com/@michabahr/point-multiple-subdomains-to-the-same-frontend-fe2b68972c68?source=tag_archive---------7-----------------------,"AWS,Serverless,Programming,Software,Website","Photo by Justin Lawrence on UnsplashThis article was first published on bahr.dev. Signup for the mailing list and get new articles straight to your inbox!Back in 2019 I built an online ticketshop for sports clubs. In its core, the shop was a webapp that processes payments and sends PDF via email. When it came to customization, things got tricky: Each club had a different name, different pictures, and sometimes even different questions they wanted to ask their customers. To give each of the clubs a customized experience, we provided each of them with their own subdomain. Eventually there were six different frontend deployments, multiple branches and the code bases started to diverge. Recently I learned that you can use DNS ARecords to route all requests under a certain domain to the same frontend. Thanks to DongGyun!This article explains how you can point multiple subdomains to the same frontend deployment by creating DNS records and a static website with the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK). That will enable you to give each of your customers a customized experience, while having just one frontend deployment.Shortcut: If you don’t need Infrastructure as Code (IaC), then an ARecord in Route 53 with *.yourdomain.com that points to your existing CloudFront distribution gets you the same result.The magic is in the chapter “Wildcard Routing”. Check out the full source code on GitHub.PrerequisitesTo deploy the solution of this article, you should have an AWS account and some experience with the AWS CDK. It’s also good to have an unused domain registered in Amazon Route 53, but we will learn how to use other providers and used domains as well.This article uses CDK version 1.60.0. Let me know if anything breaks in newer versions!Please bootstrap your account for CDK by running cdk bootstrap. We will need this for the DnsValidatedCertificate.Optional: Understanding how DNS and especially nameservers work will help you a lot with troubleshooting potential routing issues.The SolutionLet’s find a solution by putting us in the customers shoes. As a customer I want to go to bear.picture.bahr.dev or forest.picture.bahr.dev or any other address in the format *.picture.bahr.dev and then see a picture for the word in the beginning. As a developer I want the least amount of complexity possible. Multiple frontend deployments increase complexity.The request flow would look like this:You can see above that only the domain changes, but nothing else. At the core of the solution are wildcard ARecords which let us route traffic for any subdomain to a particular target. The website can then take the URL, extract the subdomain and ask for the right picture. In the next chapter we will take a look at each part in detail.1. Create A Hosted ZoneTo register DNS records in AWS, we need to create a Hosted Zone in Route 53. Each Hosted Zone costs $0.50 per month.The Hosted Zone is easiest to set up if you have a domain that is managed by Route 53 and that you don’t use for anything else yet.We will also look at how you can set up your Hosted Zone if you are already using your Route 53 domain for another purpose (e.g. your blog) or if that domain is managed by a different provider than Route 53.Depending on who manages your domain (e.g. Route 53 or GoDaddy) and if you already use your apex domain for other websites, you have to tweak the solution a bit. In my example, I already use my apex domain bahr.dev for my blog, and have the domain managed by GoDaddy. We will see how to specify the right records there in the following chapters.Warning: Before deleting hosted zones, please make sure you delete all related records in the root hosted zone or third party provider. Dangling CNAME and NS records might allow an attacker to serve content in your name.1.1 Fresh Domain That Is Managed By Route 53This is the easiest path. All we need is a Hosted Zone for our domain.import { HostedZone } from '@aws-cdk/aws-route53';...const domain = `bahr.dev`;const hostedZone = new HostedZone(this, ""HostedZone"", {    zoneName: domain});Route 53 can now serve DNS records for that domain.1.2 Used Domain That Is Managed By Route 53This assumes that you already have a Hosted Zone for your apex domain, use your apex domain for something different and want to use a subdomain instead. An apex domain is your top level domain, e.g. bahr.dev or google.com.We need to tell the DNS servers that information about the subdomain is in another Hosted Zone and do this by creating a ZoneDelegationRecord.import { HostedZone } from '@aws-cdk/aws-route53';...// bahr.dev is already in use, so we'll start // at the subdomain picture.bahr.devconst apexDomain = 'bahr.dev';const domain = `picture.${apexDomain}`;// as above we create a hostedzone for the subdomainconst hostedZone = new HostedZone(this, ""HostedZone"", {    zoneName: domain});// add a ZoneDelegationRecord so that requests for *.picture.bahr.dev // and picture.bahr.dev are handled by our newly created HostedZoneconst nameServers: string[] = hostedZone.hostedZoneNameServers!;    const rootZone = HostedZone.fromLookup(this, 'Zone', {   domainName: apexDomain });new ZoneDelegationRecord(this, ""Delegation"", {    recordName: domain,    nameServers,    zone: rootZone,    ttl: Duration.minutes(1)});A low time to live (TTL) allows for faster trial and error as DNS caches expire quicker. You should increase this as you make you get ready for production.We will later add ARecords, so that requests to picture.bahr.dev and *.picture.bahr.dev go to the same CloudFront distribution. bahr.dev will not be affected.1.3 Domain Is Managed By A Provider Other Than AWSAgain we will create a Hosted Zone in Route 53, but this time we need manual work to register the nameservers of our Hosted Zone with our DNS provider. To get started, first create a Hosted Zone through the AWS console.This will give us a Hosted Zone with two entries for Nameservers (NS) and Start Of Authority (SOA). We will copy the authoritative nameserver, and tell our DNS provider to delegate requests to our Hosted Zone in AWS.Copy the authoritative nameserver from the SOA record, go to your DNS provider and create a nameserver record, where you replace the values for Name and Value:Type: NSName: pictureValue: ns-1332.awsdns-38.orgUse a specific value like picture if you want to start at a subdomain like *.picture.bahr.dev or use @ if you want to use your apex domain like *.bahr.dev.Then use the following CDK snippet to import the Hosted Zone that you created manually.import { HostedZone } from '@aws-cdk/aws-route53';...const domain = `picture.bahr.dev`;const hostedZone = HostedZone.fromLookup(this, 'HostedZone', {   domainName: domain });2 CertificateNow that we have DNS routing set up, we can request and validate a certificate. We need this certificate to serve our website with https.With the CDK we can create and validate a certificate in one command:import { DnsValidatedCertificate, ValidationMethod } from ""@aws-cdk/aws-certificatemanager"";...const certificate = new DnsValidatedCertificate(this, ""Certificate"", {    region: 'us-east-1',    hostedZone: hostedZone,    domainName: this.domain,    subjectAlternativeNames: [`*.${this.domain}`],    validationDomains: {        [this.domain]: this.domain,        [`*.${this.domain}`]: this.domain    },    validationMethod: ValidationMethod.DNS,});There’s a lot going on here, so let’s break it down.First we set the region to us-east-1, because CloudFront requires certificates to be in us-east-1.We then use the CDK construct DnsValidatedCertificate which spawns a certificate request and a lambda function to register the CNAME record in Route 53. That record is used for validating that we actually own the domain.The parameter hostedZone specifies which Hosted Zone the certificate shall connect with. This is the Hosted Zone we created before.domainName and subjectAlternativeNames specify which domains the certificate should be valid for. The remaining parameters configure the validation process.3 Frontend DeploymentWith the certificate in place, we can create a Single Page Application (SPA) deployment via S3 and CloudFront. We’re using the npm package cdk-spa-deploy to shorten the amount of code required for configuring the S3 bucket and attaching a CloudFront distribution.import { SPADeploy } from 'cdk-spa-deploy';...const deployment = new SPADeploy(this, 'spaDeployment')    .createSiteWithCloudfront({        indexDoc: 'index.html',         websiteFolder: './website',         certificateARN: certificate.certificateArn,         cfAliases: [this.domain, `*.${this.domain}`]    });The index.html can be an HTML file as short as <p>Hello world!</p> and should be stored in the folder ./website.In the browser we can use JavaScript to get the subdomain. The line of code below splits the URL ice.picture.bahr.dev into an array ['ice', 'picture', 'bahr', 'dev'] and then picks the first element 'ice'.const subdomain = window.location.host.split('.')[0];With that information, the website can then contact the CMS to get the right assets for your customer.4 Wildcard RoutingAnd finally it’s time for the wildcard routing. With the CDK code below, all requests to *.picture.bahr.dev and picture.bahr.dev will be routed to the frontend deployment we set up above.import { CloudFrontTarget } from ""@aws-cdk/aws-route53-targets"";import { ARecord, RecordTarget } from '@aws-cdk/aws-route53';...const cloudfrontTarget = RecordTarget.fromAlias(new CloudFrontTarget(deployment.distribution));new ARecord(this, ""ARecord"", {    zone: hostedZone,    recordName: `${this.domain}`,    target: cloudfrontTarget});new ARecord(this, ""WildCardARecord"", {    zone: hostedZone,    recordName: `*.${this.domain}`,    target: cloudfrontTarget});Once all the DNS records have propagated, we can test our setup. Please note that deploying the whole solution sometimes takes 10 to 15 minutes.Try It YourselfHere’s the full CDK code that you can copy into your existing CDK codebase.I suggest that you start with checking out the source code and adjust the domain and Hosted Zone to your needs. Add a ZoneDelegationRecord if you need it. Make sure to run cdk bootstrap if you haven’t done that yet.import * as cdk from '@aws-cdk/core';import { SPADeploy } from 'cdk-spa-deploy';import { DnsValidatedCertificate, ValidationMethod } from ""@aws-cdk/aws-certificatemanager"";import { CloudFrontTarget } from ""@aws-cdk/aws-route53-targets"";import { HostedZone, ARecord, RecordTarget } from '@aws-cdk/aws-route53';export class WildcardSubdomainsStack extends cdk.Stack {  private readonly domain: string;  constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {    super(scope, id, props);        const domain = `picture.bahr.dev`;    const hostedZone = new HostedZone(this, ""HostedZone"", {      zoneName: domain    });    const certificate = new DnsValidatedCertificate(this, ""Certificate"", {      hostedZone,      domainName: this.domain,      subjectAlternativeNames: [`*.${this.domain}`],      validationDomains: {        [this.domain]: this.domain,        [`*.${this.domain}`]: this.domain      },      validationMethod: ValidationMethod.DNS    });    const deployment = new SPADeploy(this, 'spaDeployment')        .createSiteWithCloudfront({            indexDoc: 'index.html',             websiteFolder: './website',             certificateARN: certificate.certificateArn,             cfAliases: [this.domain, `*.${this.domain}`]        });    const cloudfrontTarget = RecordTarget        .fromAlias(new CloudFrontTarget(deployment.distribution));      new ARecord(this, ""ARecord"", {      zone: hostedZone,      recordName: `${this.domain}`,      target: cloudfrontTarget    });    new ARecord(this, ""WildCardARecord"", {      zone: hostedZone,      recordName: `*.${this.domain}`,      target: cloudfrontTarget    });  }}Now run AWS_PROFILE=myProfile npm run deploy to deploy the solution. Replace myProfile with whatever profile you’re using for AWS. Here’s more about AWS profiles.The deployment may take somewhere between 10 and 15 minutes. Grab a coffee and let CDK do its thing. If you run into problems, check the troubleshooting section below.Once the deployment is done, you should be able to visit any subdomain of the domain you specified (e.g. bear.picture.bahr.dev for the domain picture.bahr.dev) and see your website.TroubleshootingThe DNS routing doesn’t work.A high time to live (TTL) on DNS records can make changes difficult to test. Try to lower the TTL as far as possible.If your domain is not managed by Route 53, make sure that the DNS routing from your DNS provider is set up correctly.If you use your apex domain for something else, make sure to set up a ZoneDelegationRecord that redirects traffic for your subdomain to your new Hosted Zone.The deployment failed to clean up.Depending on which step the deployment fails, not all resources can be cleaned up. This is most likely due to the CNAME record that the lambda function of the DnsValidatedCertificate created. Go to the Hosted Zone, remove the CNAME record and delete the stack by running cdk destroy or deleting it through the AWS console’s CloudFormation service.Failed to create resource. Cannot read property ‘Name’ of undefinedClean up the stack, remove and redeploy it. I’m not sure where that error comes from, but retrying fixed it for me.The certificate validation times out.Make sure you are using the right approach so that the required CNAME record will be visible to the DNS servers. If you’ve used your domain before, set up the right ZoneDelegationRecord. This can be a bit tricky so feel free to reach out to me on Twitter.Next StepsCheck out the full source code and try it yourself! If you’d like to contribute, a PR to cdk patterns is probably a good idea.Further ReadingWhat is DNS?Host a static website with CloudFront and S3AWS profilescdk-spa-deploy on GitHubEnjoyed this article?

Sehingga merekapun mencoba untuk berdiskusi atau sekedar meminta saran saya.Terkadang, saya biasa berpikir secara spontan tentang ide spesifik mereka dan kemudian menghasilkan ide, pemikiran atau bahkan langkah-langkah yang dapat mereka ambil berdasarkan pengalaman saya sendiri.Nyatanya, saya segera menyadari bahwa hal ini sangatlah tidak membantu dan sebenarnya itu hanya ego saya semata.Saya menghabiskan beberapa waktu mencoba untuk menemukan jawaban yang lebih baik bagi siapa pun yang menanyakan pertanyaan:“Saya harus mulai darimana?”Dalam hidup saya sendiri, saya telah menemukan bahwa menambahkan beberapa pertanyaan yang menantang adalah cara paling efektif untuk mendapatkan jawaban yang terbaik.Bagi saya, ini berarti membuat sebuah kerangka atau serangkaian langkah untuk menjawab pertanyaan-pertanyaan tersebut.6 langkah untuk memulainyaCrazy 8’s MethodDalam konteks “darimana saya harus memulainya”, berikut ini adalah 6 langkah sederhana yang saya lakukan, dan semoga dapat memberikan panduan yang jelas bagi mereka yang tertarik untuk membangun sebuah perusahaan atau produk digital mereka nantinya.1. Buat sketsa apa yang akan kamu buatSaya sedikit banyak belajar bahwa ide-ide yang melayang di kepala terkadang tidak jelas dan belumlah lengkap. Membuat sketsa akan memaksamu untuk memikirkan banyak pertanyaan tentang idemu yang belum kamu pertimbangkan dan juga akan mempersiapkanmu untuk langkah # 2 yang (menurut saya) adalah langkah terpenting dari semuanya.2. Apakah orang menginginkan hal ini?Ini mungkin terdengar pertanyaan sederhana, akan tetapi 99% orang yang saya ajak bicara melewatkan langkah penting ini atau mencoba bertanya “Apakah saya menginginkan hal ini?”.Untuk menjawab pertanyaan ini, kamu dapat menggunakan sketsa dari langkah # 1 dan berbicara dengan target pelanggan / pengguna produkmu nantinya. Yap, kamu dapat menggunakan sketsa sebagai referensi untuk menjelaskan gagasan dengan jelas atau melakukan beberapa pengujian pengguna awal.Hal terpenting yang harus diketahui adalah apakah calon pelangganmu benar-benar menginginkan apa yang kamu rencanakan untuk bangun dan wujdukan.Nyatanya, hanya sedikit sekali orang yang benar-benar melakukan hal ini. Meskipun sebenarnya kita akan lebih senang jika tahu akan sesuatu lebih awal, atau mungkin dapat memodifikasi ide asli sebelumnya sehingga memiliki peluang sukses yang lebih tinggi.Catatan: Akan banyak orang yang kamu ajak bicara akan berbohong karena mereka tidak ingin menyakiti perasaanmu. Jadi, kamu harus kreatif dalam mendapatkan jawaban sebenarnya, apa yang orang mau. Kamu bisa belajar membuat User Research dari artikel — Tentang User Research3. Bagaimana hal ini akan menghasilkan uang?Terdengar klise memang, akan tetapi dengan meneliti saluran penjualan / pemasaran akan membantumu dalam menginformasikan model bisnis apa yang terbukti dapat bertahan di pasar saat ini. Cukup banyak model bisnis yang ada dipasaran, dari mulai subcription based hingga sharing commision.Kamu hanya perlu mulai dari bayangan yang akan dilakukan orang ketika menghargai produkmu nantinya.4. Seberapa banyak?Oke, jika kamu cukup yakin bahwa produkmu adalah apa yang dinginkan orang. Sekarang, kamu harus melakukan beberapa penghitungan cepat untuk mengetahui seberapa banyak orang yang menginginkannya, apakah mereka mau membayar dan apakah produk tersebut memiliki peluang untuk berkelanjutan kedepan.Ingat, jika kita membangun produk yang diinginkan orang, artinya hal ini akan jelas membantu dalam bisnismu untuk berkembang!5. Identifikasi inti dari idemuIni akan sangat terkait dengan langkah # 2. Mengidentifikasi inti dari ide pada dasarnya adalah lanjutan dari “apakah orang menginginkan hal ini?”.Langkah ini akan membantumu mengambil ide produk yang sangat jauh lebih besar yang ada dalam pikiranmu sekarang dan mempersempit ruang lingkup menjadi jauh lebih kecil sehingga kamu dapat memiliki titik awal darimana kamu akan memulainya.Saya cukup bosan mendengar terlalu banyak orang yang mengoceh tentang fitur imajiner dari ide produk mereka. Hampir tidak mungkin untuk membuat produk yang bagus jika versi pertamanya adalah kumpulan asumsimu tentang apa yang diinginkan orang.Note: Ini juga membuat tugas menjadi sangat sulit bagi designer dan engineer mana pun yang mungkin bekerja denganmu, belum lagi fakta bahwa kamu dapat melakukan kesalahan besar dengan cara ini.Perusahaan konsultan McKinsey memiliki metode yang baik untuk memecah masalah menjadi bagian-bagian komponennya yang disebut MECE (berikut adalah detail lebih lanjut tentang cara kerjanya: yang mungkin membantu dalam mengidentifikasi asumsi kunci dari idemu yang lebih besar).6. Gambarkan lebih spesifikSekarang, coba kamu buat sketsa yang lebih spesifik dan mendetail berdasarkan ruang lingkup baru yang sudah kamu persempit. Untuk hal ini, kamu dapat membuatnya dengan Crazy 8’s.Crazy 8’s adalah metode inti dari Desain Sprint. Ini adalah latihan untuk membuat sketsa dengan cepat. Crazy 8’s dilakukan dengan menantang orang untuk membuat sketsa delapan ide (halaman) berbeda dalam delapan menit. Tujuan dari Crazy 8’s adalah untuk mendorong melampaui ide pertamamu yang seringkali merupakan ide yang paling tidak inovatif, dan menghasilkan berbagai macam solusi untuk tantanganmu kedepan.Membangun sebuah produkMVP — gambar oleh x-staticmediagroupBangun MVP (Minimum Valuable Product)-mu. Setelah kamu dapat menyelesaikan langkah 1–6 (yang dapat kamu lakukan dengan sangat cepat).Now, stop talking and start working.Secara teori, fase ini seharusnya tidak memakan banyak waktu (atau menghabiskan banyak uang) karena kamu telah mempersempit cakupan ke masalah dan produk yang didefinisikan dengan baik.KodingWorks sendiri dapat membantumu dalam membangun MVP produkmu. Kami adalah Software Company yang berfokus pada user/pengguna sehingga produk digital yang kami kembangkan tidak hanya tentang pada feature yang canggih, akan tetapi hal yang benar-benar dibutuhkan oleh pengguna.Setelah MVPmu ada, ada 2 hal yang harus kamu lakukan selanjutnya. Hal ini yang menjadi titik awal dalam pengembangan lanjutan produkmu agar bisa sesuai dengan apa yang orang mau.1. Uji produkmu, ulangi, ulangi dan ulangi.Setelah atau bahkan selama pengembangan MVP dari produkmu, mulai tunjukkan produkmu kepada para calon pengguna dan minta mereka menggunakannya.Ohya, coba hindari godaan untuk mengatakan“Ini belum siap… Saya hanya perlu menyelesaikan beberapa hal lagi”.TIDAK.Kamu sebenarnya tidak perlu menyelesaikan beberapa hal lagi. Semakin cepat orang menggunakannya, semakin cepat kamu akan tahu elemen apa yang sebenarnya diinginkan orang.2. Temukan pasar yang tepat.Ini adalah langkah yang terakhir. Bagi saya, ini adalah perjalanan yang sesungguhnya dari perusahaan dan produk digitalmu. Bagaimana kita bisa benar-benar meluncurkan sebuah produk yang memang memiliki pasar penggunanya.Temukan, dimana pasar untuk produkmu? dan akankah orang-orang membayarnya?Jika kamu mengikuti langkah-langkah ini, saya tidak dapat menjanjikan bahwa produk atau bisnismu akan berhasil, tetapi saya dapat berjanji bahwa hal ini akan banyak membuat kemajuan dalam menemukan jawaban yang sebenarnya.Saya juga merekomendasikan untuk tidak menghabiskan uang untuk layanan pihak ketiga kecuali pada langkah # 3 (pengeluaran untuk iklan atau penjualan) jika kamu nyatanya dapat melakukan pra-penjualan atau mengarahkan prospek bahkan sebelum produk dikembangkan atau pada langkah # 6 (pengeluaran untuk pengembang perangkat lunak) untuk membangun MVP.Ohya, hal ini bisa kamu lakukan hanya dalam waktu kurang dari 1 bulan. Jika kamu benar-benar serius untuk memulai perusahaan atau digitalmu ya.Jika tertarik dengan Materi Publikasi dari @Kodingworks kamu bisa ikuti kami di:Instagram, Twitter, DribblekodingworksOn Demand Engineering PlatfromFollow35 ProductStartupSoftwareDevelopmentUser Research35 claps35 clapsWritten byM Arkham C JantraFollowCo-Founder @kodingworksio • Product and Business • Have a question? find me on twitter.com/macjantraFollowkodingworksFollowKodingWorks is an on-demand engineering platform.

Internship Week 4,https://medium.com/@theoluciano/internship-week-4-cbb9ca8aa3e4?source=tag_archive---------9-----------------------,"Internships,Life,DoorDash,Work,Software","An epiphany of mine from this weekIt was certainly an eventful week.The biggest change is that I jumped off the Airbnb train and got into my own apartment.Raleigh is one of the three points of what is called the Research Triangle. The other two points are the cities of Durham and Chapel Hill. It’s called the Research Triangle because within those cities are three of the biggest research powerhouse universities: North Carolina State University, Duke University, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.Along with those large schools are many smaller ones, so there is a myriad of housing options. I found one that will do. For now.I already locked myself out of my room once, but thankfully I found a knife in the kitchen that I stuck between the jam and the door and used to push the latch bolt (I had to Google what it was called) back and get into my room without having to break down the door. So I’m grateful for that.(if you want to hear more about mishaps like this and other general factoids of my life, check out my podcast and listen pretty much anywhere you listen to podcasts. Enjoy and give me money if you want)Regarding my work at RoleModel, this week had a distinct marketing flavor. As we prepare for our product’s soft launch, Ken and I went through a list of areas that needed to be addressed to prepare for that.Let me just say, there’s a lot that goes into a successful product launch and I’m sure I don’t even know the half of it.I scheduled some meetings with the individuals in the offices who specialized in the certain areas that needed to be looked at. For instance, I scheduled a meeting with Roy, our COO, to go over the legal and financial aspects of the list. I had a meeting with Phil, our project manager, to go over more of the logistical side of things. I also had a meeting with Jamey, our marketing director, to go over marketing components.From my meeting with him, he gave me a solid framework on how to get started on creating a marketing plan, which I got to work on.Side note: since the inception of a competent search engine like Google, you no longer have a good excuse for not knowing how to do something. There’s definitely someone who has done before what you’re trying to do now.And they most likely blogged/vlogged/tik-toked about it. You just gotta find it.I worked on and still am working on the marketing plan, but besides that, Ken suggested that I also start to look into landing page formats and copy ideas for a webpage for our product. He told me to look at a previous site the company had built for another product they've created for the OCR Sprint competition community (Think “American Ninja Warrior”). Ken suggested I base my ideas off of that site and then adapt for the completely different industry that is being targeted.I’ve been working on that a few different ways.First, I’ve just been brainstorming all the different ways I can write about the product. I keep track in a Google Doc that is basically just a scratchpad for a bunch of random passages and lines that hopefully can be used as copy for the product’s marketing pursuits.Photo by Alvaro Reyes on UnsplashSecond, I’ve been modeling a mock-up website using a program called Figma. Figma is a collaborative design tool. Through basic tools, you can create extensive and elaborate designs that can link to each other and act almost like an actual website. Laying out what a landing page could potentially look like has been a great way to think about all the different aspects of the product that should be presented.In other news, I’m crushing the DoorDash delivery boy game. I was up way too late last night bringing food to needy souls. FYI, Dennys is the place to be at midnight and beyond….apparently.I also spent a blessed time with new friends/brothers and sisters in Christ at a church home group meeting, where we dove into the account of the Transfiguration, discussed what our place is in the church, and had a sweet time of worship in song and prayer. It’s always encouraging to see the love of Christ shown through the church towards me when I’ve been in a new place. It inspires me to do the same for others.Final note, I think I’m going to see the ocean on Labor Day, so I’m excited about that!Hope ya’ll have a blessed weekend!Is anyone worthy?Is anyone whole?Is anyone able to break the seal and open the scroll?The Lion of Judah who conquered the graveHe is David’s root and the Lamb who died to ransom the slaveIs He worthy?

How to use git as a software development team,https://medium.com/@abolfazli.mahdi/how-to-use-git-as-a-software-development-team-ab33af0435de?source=tag_archive---------10-----------------------,"Git,Gitlab,Software Development,Software,Github","If you have been using git as a single developer, there has not been many issues that you would face. You will use commit and push for every feature you develop. But what if you are developing in a team? What are the obstacles in using git in this way?When a team is working on a project, you may be working on a feature and your colleague is working on another feature simultaneously, as a result, if one of you pushes the changes to the remote, you may have some difficulties to push the server. Why? Because you might both have changed a file and this may cause a conflict. Then what’s the solution?Development teams must have strategies to prevent mentioned issues. One of the strategies you can use is rebasing the master before pushing the changes. Let’s see how we can do so.First of all, we have master branch on remote(github, gitlab or …). I will be explaining the way we use in gitlab from now on. The most strict rule is that nobody should have the permission to push the changes to this master branch directly. Let’s say Alice wants to develop Posts feature and Sara wants to develop the Comments feature. Alice will create an issue with “develop posts” title and its number is 14 and then she creates a branch called 14-develop_posts. Sara will create an issue with “develop comments” title and its number is 15 and then she creates a branch called 15-develop_comments.Let’s say Sara has finished her work. If there are other teammates on the projects, she must do what Alice will do next. But let’s say there are just two of them and nobody has changed the master branch until now. She will commit her changes. She may also squash the commits if there is more than one commit in the branch she developed. And after all, she push the branch to the remote(named origin). At last, she will create a merge request and after it is accepted, the master branch will be updated to her changes.Now if Alice has finished the feature she was working on, she must first rebase with master branch. First, she commits the changes in the branch she is working on:git add . (or git add — all)git commit -am “commit message”Then she must squash the commits she has made:git logCopy the hash commit before the first commit in this branch. It means if we have 3 commits in our branch, we should copy the 4th commit in the log.git rebase -i commit-hashIn the editor that opens, first commit should be pick, and others should be squash. And edit the commit message as follow and save it.Commit message example:Add posts to articles(#14)- Create posts layout - Create posts adapter- Create posts fragmentCommit message suggestions:1. Title and body must begin with capital letter2. Title and body should usually begin with imperative verbs3. After title put the branch number in parenthesis4. In body, say WHAT and WHY about the changes, not HOW you made the changes.5. Use dash or asterisk to begin the body sentences.Then she should update her master branch with remote:git checkout mastergit pull origin masterThen she should rebase her branch onto the updated master branch:git checkout 14-develop_postsgit rebase masterIf there are conflicts, she must resolve them. After resolving the conflicts, she can push to the remote(origin here):git push originNow she must go the issue she has created and create a merge request. After the merge request is accepted by the maintainer, she can create another issue, then creates the branch. Now she must update her local master branch.git pull origin masterAfter all, she must update remote branches and delete the previous local branch:git remote update origin — prunegit branch -D 14-develop_postsThat is it. This way, all the team will be happy and can use git effectively. There are other ways to use git as a team but this is the way we are using in our team.

As for the remaining items, you can either remove them from the machine or mark them as false positives.Various advanced options to managePower users may tinker with settings to enable deep scan mode (slow but effective), terminate memory threats while scanning, disable heuristics rules, as well as to ignore suspicious packers, loaders, incomplete files, and files whose size surpasses 16Mb.It is possible to disable logging, set GridinSoft Anti-Malware to autorun at startup, choose the program startup scan mode (standard, quick, full, removable), edit proxy parameters, and disable notification sounds.Browse the Internet the safe wayAnother notable feature is represented by a real-time scanner that prevents e-threats from infiltrating into your system. Extra tools let you reset browser settings, update policies and the Hosts file, scan Windows components (ActiveX, Windows services, IE extensions, startup links), collect system information and check out all GridinSoft Anti-Malware log files, plus the quarantine list.Requiring a decent amount of resourcesThe feature-packed antivirus system offers multilingual support and has a very good response time. However, it demands a massive amount of memory to work properly, so users might experience stability issues on older OS platforms. Other than that, GridinSoft Anti-Malware offers a simple solution for successfully eliminating viruses rapidly, backed up by a highly intuitive environment.In conclusionTo sum it up, GridinSoft Anti-Malware may not be the best of its kind when it comes to keeping your computer safe from various infiltrations. However, it manages to combine a pleasant interface with a handful of helpful tools that make it worth at least a try.Written byAlbertclarkeInterested in gaming, computers, science and tech.FollowSoftwareMore from AlbertclarkeFollowInterested in gaming, computers, science and tech.More From MediumSecrets Management Stinks, Use Some SOPS!Dat Tran in Better ProgrammingThe Whys and Hows for Small Businesses Data ProtectionJohn Teehan in The StartupSQL InjectionsMartin Thoma in FAUNUsing a truly private browser — BraveDave SmithEnergy Grid Isn’t Insured Enough to Handle a Catastrophic HackBloomberg in BloombergThe New Age Email EtiquetteRajesh NarayananA Frightening New Kind Of DDoS Attack Is Breaking RecordsForbes in ForbesBootstrapping a Bug Bounty ProgramCheston Lee in The StartupAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Software Licensing,https://medium.com/@chandulakan123/software-licensing-598199e82c14?source=tag_archive---------15-----------------------,"License,Software,Copyright,Right,Permission","A software license is a document that provides legally binding guidelines for the use and distribution of software.Software licenses typically provide end users with the right to one or more copies of the software without violating copyrights. The license also defines the responsibilities of the parties entering into the license agreement and may impose restrictions on how the software can be used. Software licensing terms and conditions usually include fair use of the software, the limitations of liability, warranties and disclaimers and protections if the software or its use infringes on the intellectual property rights of others.Software licenses typically are either proprietary, free or open source, the distinguishing feature being the terms under which users may redistribute or copy the software for future development or use.Software licensing typesGNU/GPL General Public LicenseThe first type of software license which we will cover here is known as the GNU GPL, or simply the GPL license. This General Public License is the most widely used type of free software license, and was originally created for the GNU Project by Richard Stallman. The GNU project is a huge project of a mass collaboration of free software which was announced on September 27, 1983. In this announcement, the goal of the project was stated to be to develop, “a sufficient body of free software ….to get along without any software that is not free.” As Wikipedia explains, Stallman set out to create one license which could be used for any project, which would make it impossible for several projects to share the same code.This type of licensing soon became known as General Public Licensing or GPL. It is the first copyleft license which was created for use by the public.The derived works from this type of licensing can only be distributed if it is done so under the same license terms as the original.This allows the end user of the program to retain the rights of the free software definition while using copyleft to make sure that the freedoms of the license are protected even if the work is modified.The terms and conditions which come with the GPL must be expressed clearly to anyone who receives a copy of the work for which a GPL is attached. If a licensee agrees to these terms and conditions, he or she may be given permission to modify the work, copy it, or distribute it or any modified version. This may be done either as a free service or for a fee, in accordance with copyleft laws. Copyleft is basically just as it sounds. It is the opposite of a copyright which restricts the recipient of software. Copyleft grants right to the recipient, and makes sure that those rights cannot be taken away from them.2. End-user license agreementAn end-user license agreement (EULA) is a legal contract entered into between a software developer or vendor and the user of the software, often where the software has been purchased by the user from an intermediary such as a retailer. A EULA specifies in detail the rights and restrictions which apply to the use of the software.Many form contracts are only contained in digital form, and only presented to a user as a click-through which the user must “accept”. As the user may not see the agreement until after he or she has already purchased the software, these documents may be contracts of adhesion.Some end-user license agreements accompany shrink-wrapped software that is presented to a user sometimes on paper or more usually electronically, during the installation procedure. The user has the choice of accepting or rejecting the agreement. The installation of the software is conditional to the user clicking a button labelled “accept”.3. Free software LicenseA free-software license is a notice that grants the recipient of a piece of software extensive rights to modify and redistribute that software. These actions are usually prohibited by copyright law, but the rights-holder (usually the author) of a piece of software can remove these restrictions by accompanying the software with a software license which grants the recipient these rights. Software using such a license is free software (or free and open-source software) as conferred by the copyright holder. Free-software licenses are applied to software in source code and also binary object-code form, as the copyright law recognizes both forms.4.Permissive Software LicenseA permissive software license, sometimes also called BSD-like or BSD-style license, is a free-software license with only minimal restrictions on how the software can be used, modified, and redistributed, usually including a warranty disclaimer. Examples include the GNU All-permissive License, MIT License, BSD licenses, Apple Public Source License and Apache license. As of 2016, the most popular free-software license is the permissive MIT license.MIT Software LicensingThe MIT Software Licensing gets its name from the fact that it was created at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It is known as a permissive free software license, which means that it permits the recipient to reuse the software if all of the copies of the licensed software come with a copy of the original terms of the MIT License. This proprietary software may incorporate software under the MIT License, but it retains its proprietary nature. The license was written for the X Window System, but has also been used in Expat, PuTTY, the Mono Development Platform class libraries, CakePHP, Ruby on Rails, Symfony, and Lua.Wikipedia shares the following as a sample of the MIT License agreement:Copyright (C) <year> <copyright holders>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sub-license, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.In a nutshell, you can use a MIT-licensed software in your own projects and resell it. You are not obliged to publicly share the source code of your product.The Apache 2.0 LicenseThe Apache 2.0 license is a permissive free software license by the Apache Software Foundation. The 2.0 version requires preservation of the copyright notice and disclaimer. It also allows the user of the software the freedom to use the software for any purpose, modify it, and distribute the modified versions of the software, under the terms of the license, without concern for royalties.The BSD LicenseBSD licenses are a family of permissive free software licenses, imposing minimal restrictions on the use and distribution of covered software. This is in contrast to copyleft licenses, which have share-alike requirements. The original BSD license was used for its namesake, the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), a Unix-like operating system. The original version has since been revised, and its descendants are referred to as modified BSD licenses.BSD is both a license and a class of license (generally referred to as BSD-like). The modified BSD license (in wide use today) is very similar to the license originally used for the BSD version of Unix. The BSD license is a simple license that merely requires that all code retain the BSD license notice if redistributed in source code format, or reproduce the notice if redistributed in binary format. The BSD license (unlike some other licenses) does not require that source code be distributed at all.Public-domain-equivalent licensePublic-domain-equivalent license are licenses that grant public-domain-like rights and/or act as waivers. They are used to make copyrighted works usable by anyone without conditions, while avoiding the complexities of attribution or license compatibility that occur with other licenses.No permission or license is required for a work truly in the public domain, such as one with an expired copyright; such a work may be copied at will. Public domain equivalent licenses exist because some legal jurisdictions do not provide for authors to voluntarily place their work in the public domain, but do allow them to grant arbitrarily broad rights in the work to the public.Zero / public domainBesides copyright licenses, Creative Commons also offers CC0, a tool for relinquishing copyright and releasing material into the public domain. CC0 is a legal tool for waiving as many rights as legally possible.Or, when not legally possible, CC0 acts as fallback as public domain equivalent license.Development of CC0 began in 2007 and was released in 2009. A major target of the license was the scientific data community.Written byNipuni KodithuwakkuSoftware Engineering | Level 3 Undergraduate | Tech enthusiast | Developer,Follow1 1 1 LicenseSoftwareCopyrightRightPermissionMore from Nipuni KodithuwakkuFollowSoftware Engineering | Level 3 Undergraduate | Tech enthusiast | Developer,More From MediumBetter Programming Style Guide and SuggestionsZack Shapiro in Better ProgrammingBuilding an Application: Pre-WorkHannah Kofkin in Better ProgrammingImage Processing Basics through OpenCVShuvayan Ghosh Dastidar in Towards AIApache Kafka on Kubernetes with Strimzi — Part 1Sina NourianBrowser Wars™ (Extended) From a Developer Point of ViewAlex Obreja in The StartupHow to Pick the Right Software Architecture for a Product From the StartAndrei Gridnev in The StartupThe Behavioural Patterns That Lead to High-Performing TeamsCostas Andreou in Better ProgrammingHow to Get Out of (or Completely Avoid) the Tutorial TrapAndrew Lundy in Dev GeniusAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Gigapixel AI 5.1.5 crack download,https://medium.com/@robertcallton/gigapixel-ai-5-1-5-crack-download-6b555e951063?source=tag_archive---------16-----------------------,Software,"Gigapixel AI is a tool meant to help you get the clearest image quality after considerably enlarging the original. It uses machine learning technology to maintain accuracy and upscale your pictures’ quality at the highest standards.CRACK DOWNLOAD:https://nitroflare.com/view/1FE049C1A9AD004/Gigapixel_AI_5.1.5_crack.rarGigapixel AI in contextGigapixel AI offers performant upscaling for all kinds of pictures. The goal is to enlarge a picture and preserve quality, which is a difficult thing to do. Indeed, most upscaling programs offer a slightly modified version of the original by adjusting the edge contrast and the picture’s sharpness. Some of the most well-known graphic editors offer advanced techniques for picture refinement by using different, combined functionalities such as shake reduction, duplicating and editing blur traces, artifact suppression, and much more.However, although we can’t know for sure what kind of technology Gigapixel AI integrates, the tool is really performant compared with others in its league. It manages to increase pictures’ quality even at high scale enlargements. The tool’s developers announced their latest machine learning developments and some of the Gigapixel AI capabilities were associated with these new implementations.Upscaling at high-resolutionIndeed, no matter the back-end functionalities and implementations, the tool does work and does make qualitative, highly enlarged photos. The new feature called Face Refinement, which uses machine learning and image recognition, manages to produce really good outcomes for portraits and face enlarged photographs.The tool system is well-built and the GUI looks modern and minimalistic. Gigapixel AI is not a sophisticated and overly-complicated program. It has the essentials and performs its tasks smoothly and gracefully. It is easy, simple, and pleasant to use the program. You can open multiple pictures and select the ones you want to apply the modifications to. The commands in the right-side panel are simple and customizable: the scale options, the width and height adjustment, noise suppression, blur adjustments, etc.ConclusionTo summarize, Gigapixel AI is a qualitative tool. It is well-built, performant, and does not have any noticeable issues at a normal, non-expert end-user look. The price seems a bit too high; however, if you find Gigapixel AI to be what you need after finishing the trial, go ahead and buy a license. After all, the price can be justified by the program’s efficiency and capabilities.Written byRobertcalltonInterested in computer science, gaming and technology.FollowSoftwareMore from RobertcalltonFollowInterested in computer science, gaming and technology.More From MediumReimagining a world with AIrafidah in The StartupArtificial Intelligence doesn’t always need to be more humanDigital Leaders in Digital LeadersDeep Fakes: Are Fake News becoming real?Michael Mirwald in REWRITE TECH by diconiumYour Operating Model Cannot Support Automation and AIZack Kelemen in Slalom TechnologyImpact, Bias, and Sustainability in AIJennifer Prendki in AlectioA New Capability Maturity Model for Deep LearningCarlos E.

Once you reach the main menu of AVG Internet Security, you’re greeted by these five components, which get automatically activated after setup.Redesigned interface and six scanning modesAs far as the interface is concerned, the latest edition of AVG Internet Security has a new, more sophisticated design. Six types of scanning modes are available, once the initial scan is over: the full scan looks into all parts of the computer for malware, deep virus scan checks only areas most likely to get infected, and USB / DVD scan which verifies removable media devices.You can also turn to file or folder scans to look into any suspicious files or folders, performance scan to check the PC and fix any performance-related issues or remove junk files, along with boot-time scan to run the scanner right before Windows starts, in order to identify any malware agents that get activated automatically at startup. It’s also possible to schedule scan jobs for later.Antimalware engine based on six layers of protectionThe antivirus engine consists of multiple detection methods: signatures, polymorphic (to find new variants of known viruses, even if they now have a different behavior), heuristics (determines malware based on the program’s behavior and should work when the signature method fails), real-time outbreak (adds crowd intelligence to the cloud to detect the newest threats) and CyberCapture, a new feature launched by AVG that’s a cloud-based smart file scanner which isolates and analyzes suspicious items.Written byRobertcalltonInterested in computer science, gaming and technology.FollowSoftwareMore from RobertcalltonFollowInterested in computer science, gaming and technology.More From Medium15 Tips To Improve Your Mac SecurityGuillermo Barreiro in Mac O’ClockRoR JWT Encryption from ScratchTj Blogumas in DevOps DudesRe-Hashed: How Google and Facebook Manipulate Users to Circumvent GDPRThe SSL Store™How to Make a Captive Portal of DeathTrevor Phillips in InfoSec Write-upsManaging Ethereum Private KeysSeung Woo Kim in CodeChainWhy air transport is burying its head in the cyber sandThelma Etim in PredictBecoming Root Through An SUID ExecutableVickie LiSecurity Automation and the Coming SingularitySome Dude Says in The StartupAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

"PS5 price, release date, games, Xbox Series X comparison and more",https://medium.com/@shanegalnod/ps5-price-release-date-games-xbox-series-x-comparison-and-more-68c3e089b48?source=tag_archive---------25-----------------------,Software,"It looks like the rumors about an initial limited production run for the next-generation PlayStation 5 console might still come true: Sony emailed selected current customers, based on “previous interests and PlayStation activities,” with an offer of early preorder reservations for the console for a limited window of time, only one PS5 per PSN ID, and on a first-come, first-served basis. It’s possible that Sony’s doing this just to bump up the preorder FOMO, but it’s also possible that it’s doing this to make sure the people who are most likely to buy it — given we don’t even know the price yet — and who are obviously most eager for it, don’t get shut out if there are production issues. At its streaming Future of Gaming event in early June.We finally got to see the PS5 hardware, along with its new family members, as well as a host of games we can expect. Add that to the detailed hardware specifications that the company gave us over a year earlier in April 2019, and the only big mystery still remaining is the price. And possibly how confused you may be about whether you can use your PS4’s DualShock controller with it. Sony put up a carefully worded blog post in early August “clarifying” which of your older console accessories will work with the PS5. The answer is: some. Basically, if it’s a PS4 game running on the PS5, it will be compatible. If it’s a PS5 game, then sort of, maybe, check with individual game developers.There’s a whole family of accessories to match the somewhat controversial design, which Sony’s PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan calls “bold, daring and future facing,” including a new headset, the Pulse 3D, which probably takes advantage of the ray-traced audio technology in the PS5. There’s also a media remote and updated camera. It’s unknown as to whether any or all of these will be bundled with the PS5 or optional purchases.Make that prices — there is a Digital Edition with no Blu-ray drive, which presumably will be less expensive than the standard model. But it’s likely that even if console prices match those of the PS4, it’s possible you’ll be paying a premium for games as well; 2K has priced its PS5 version of NBA 2K21 at $10 more than the PS4 version. Sony continues to stick to its holiday 2020 release, but we still don’t know how much we’ll have to shell out for it. The cost to manufacture one is reportedly $450, according to a Bloomberg report in mid-February. One contributor to the steep cost is the low supply of DRAM and NAND flash memory that’s also used in smartphones. Even so, Sony may still give the PS5 a lower price tag in order to compete with Microsoft and its upcoming Xbox Series X. One Canadian retailer reportedly priced the console at $559 in Canadian dollars, which would equate to approximately $410.https://angel.co/company/the-cornered-mouse-dreams-of-cheesehttps://angel.co/company/a-taxi-driver-full-download-with-engsubshttps://angel.co/company/miracle-in-cell-no-7-full-downloadWritten byShanegalnodInterested in gaming, computers and technology.FollowSoftwareMore from ShanegalnodFollowInterested in gaming, computers and technology.More From MediumBug Fables Review: Paper Mario 3?Cole Durrett in SUPERJUMPCuphead ReviewCaden BrooksMoney Making Colonies In Fallout 76Anthony Mountjoy in Verboten PublishingPushing the Sega Dreamcast to its Absolute LimitAlex Beyman in PredictGaming in 2020: 4 Reasonable Predictions and 2 Ridiculous OnesPCMag in PC MagazineJournal Entries of a Developer Crafting His First Roguelike GameE.T.

.NET Async Programming in a Nutshell,https://medium.com/@nelsonparente/net-async-programming-in-a-nutshell-dc01c2e71a20?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Programming,Software Development,Aspnetcore,Software Engineering,Software","Photo by Lopez Robin on UnsplashAsynchronous programming is not a new concept and has been around for several years and it is nowadays a new standard in modern frameworks like AspNetCore. This framework is now fully asynchronous and it's not easy to avoid using its async keyword.I think there is a certain cloud of fear when it comes to asynchronism, developers sometimes feel afraid of using it because they don’t understand how to use it and its best practices.Another reason for this sense of fear is due to the fact that in the past asynchronous programming was not easy at all indeed. Since the introduction of async/await keywords in C# 5 asynchronous programming has become much easier to work with.If you are afraid of asynchronism you have come to the right place, there is no need to jump up to me! In this article, I’ll present you with some of the best practices when it comes to async programming in .NET and you’ll see that's not that big of a deal you might think it is.What is Asynchronous Programming?“Asynchronous programming is a means of parallel programming in which a unit of work runs separately from the main application thread and notifies the calling thread of its completion, failure or progress.” — SourceThe core of asynchronous programming are theTask objects, which model asynchronous operations. They are supported by the async and await keywords.The await keyword is where the magic happens. It yields control to the caller of the method that performed await, and it ultimately allows a service to be elastic.Async all the wayWhen using asynchronous programming you should use it all the way, this means that all your callers should be async. The effort in asynchronous programming can be worthless if you don’t apply it all the way in your code.In some cases partially asynchronism can outcome worst results that fully synchronous programming, therefore my advice is to go asynchronous all over your entire stack.This next piece of code is a good example where sync is preferable over async. Here the use of Task.Result blocks the current thread to wait for the result.public int MyMethodAsync(){    var result = OtherMethodAsync().Result;    return result + 1;}The right way to do this is by using the await keyword to get the result:public async Task<int> MyMethodAsync(){    var result = await OtherMethodAsync();    return result + 1;}Just don’t return async void, trust meIt’s never a good option to use to return void in an async method in .Net, never.The most common situation where people feel like async void is a good idea is when implementing a fire-and-forget, it isn’t at all. If any exception is thrown in an async void method the process will be stoped.So instead of using async void you can use the Task.Run since if any unhandled exception happens the TaskScheduler.UnobservedTaskException will be triggered.public void RunFireAndForgetOperation(){    Task.Run(FireAndForgetAsync);}public async Task FireAndForgetAsync(){    var result = await RunOperationAsync();    ParseResult(result);}Async/await over Task returnPlease take this one with a pinch of salt because when it comes to performance, returning directly a Task is faster because there is no computation done in the async state machine but with this, you can end up not taking advantage of the async state machine benefits. The StateMachine is a struct created when using the async/await keywords.So there are several benefits when using the async/await keywords:Asynchronous and synchronous exceptions are normalized to always be asynchronous;Exceptions thrown will be automatically wrapped in the returned Task instead of surprising the caller with an actual exception;The code is easier to modify;To wrap up, these are some practices that you should follow when it comes to asynchronous programming and there are lots of great resources over the internet that you can use to know more about this subject and enhance your skills.Asynchronous programming can simultaneously be your best ally along with being your worst enemy, the key to success is to study and understand how to use it properly.Remember to always look up to understanding how things really work on a deeper level and don’t try to just follow the patterns or you can end up in a Cargo Cult Anti-Pattern.Nelson out!Written byNelson ParenteTackling big problems with simple solutions.

An Introduction to REST APIs and Microservices,https://medium.com/the-software-design-blog/an-introduction-to-rest-apis-and-microservices-ea9477699b73?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Soft,Software,Web Development,Web Design,Computer Science","When designing web applications, we often use APIs to incorporate data from different sources into our apps. APIs or Application Programmable Interface form the basis of almost every modern web application. In this blog, we’ll try to explore various protocols/techniques used for making these APIs and the advantages these techniques provide over each other.RESTREST stands for REpresentational State Transfer.REST is an architectural style for designing APIs and is probably the most commonly used architecture these days for web applications. It aims to provide a uniform interface for interaction with data by using several constraints.A lot of people confuse REST with the way HTTP works. REST in itself is not a protocol. Its a set of architectural principles, which intends to make the web more streamlined and uniform. REST uses JSON on top of HTTP(in most cases) to achieve this.The core concept of REST is that the Server has to be completely stateless i.e. it can’t store states. Hence, the server loses the ability to store sessions as well. The session states are stored on Client-Side completely. That is why, whenever a request is made to a REST API, we need to pass in the session data along with the request, as server data has no ability to store them.In REST, every file — Image, CSS, HTML, etc. is called a resource. The state of a resource at a particular timestamp is called the resource representation.Resource Representation = Data + Metadata + Hypermedia LinksHypermedia is the engine of REST Architecture.As the name suggests, the resource representation is transferred from client to server, where the server doesn’t have the ability to store previous states. It can just store the current state of the resource representation.In other words, in the REST architectural style, data and functionality are considered resources and are accessed using Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs). The resources are acted upon by using a set of simple, well-defined operations. The clients and servers exchange representations of resources by using a standardized interface and protocol — typically HTTP. The client is stateful (can store and operate on states) whereas the server is completely stateless(can just store the current state).SOAPSimple Object Access Protocol or SOAP is another paradigm used to build APIs. But unlike REST, SOAP is a communication protocol, just like HTTP.SOAP exclusively using XML for messaging, whereas REST gives us the freedom to use anything — JSON, XML, CSV, etc. for the same.All SOAP RPC Calls are made on top of the HTTP POST Request. Hence, they are not cacheable on Client Side.The Server is stateless in SOAP — but there is no restriction on it. It can be made stateful very easily with minor changes.SOAP is platform and language-dependent, whereas REST is not.Microservice-Based ArchitectureConventional Apps are single units that create a single point of failure. Hence, when a small part of such an application fails or needs to be updated, the whole application is unable to function. This effect of the working of one component on the other is called Coupling.These applications are called Monolithic Applications. They are tightly coupled applications i.e. if one part fails/changes, the whole application might not function or needs to be altered. Over time, this creates problems in maintenance and the quality of the codebase also deteriorates.However, to ensure high availability and ease of maintenance these days, organizations use Microservice Based Architecture in their applications mostly.Microservices are small independent units or services, each running their own process, that comes together to form a larger application or service.Microservices are independent services that run on their own processes. Hence, it helps to maintain the modularity of code.Microservices communicate with each other using lightweight mechanisms like HTTP Resource APIsAs Microservices are independent units, the application thus created has loose coupling i.e. the failure of one part doesn’t affect the other. In fact, Microservices have no knowledge of each other’s existence.Microservices allow cross-language development i.e. different microservices can be written in different languages and hence, can be maintained by different teams.When should we use a Monolith vs Microservices?Monolith Architecture is suited for small to medium scale applications generally. It is used when the application is expected to handle a limited number of users and scaling for a large user base is not an issue(No unexpected/exponential growth of users is expected).In many cases, teams decide to start with a Monolith Architecture and then scale to a Microservice-based Architecture if need be.A Brief History of Scaling LinkedInLinkedIn started in 2003 with the goal of connecting to your network for better job opportunities. It had only 2,700…engineering.linkedin.comMicroservice based Architechtures fit best for complex applications like Social Media Networks etc. where the userbase is expected to rise exponentially at some point in time.A typical e-commerce application has various components such as ordering, inventory check, user accounts, etc. which can be divided into separate microservices, following the Principle of Single Responsibility and Separation of Concerns.e-commerce application simple microservice representationSo, in conclusion, three approaches are possible —Picking a monolithic architecturePicking a microservice architectureStarting with a monolithic architecture and then later scale out into a microservice architecture.Picking a monolithic or a microservice architecture largely depends on our use case.No architecture is the right architecture for anything. Software Engineering is all by scaling and adjusting to the requirements.I’ll suggest, keep things simple, have a thorough understanding of the requirements. Analyze your requirements and build something only when you need it & keep evolving the code iteratively. This is the right way to go.If you like this article, make sure you clap for it and drop your views if you liked or disliked anything.

The oldest contributors of Gen Z are getting into the market at some point of an fascinating time, with the Country unemployment price at an surprising low and employers conflict to obtain and hold rewarding talent.However, the younger Genius is chasing one career in particular: software program engineering. Software engineer functions accounted for 19% of all job functions from Gen Z’ers in the World, making it the most in-demand job amongst that generation, in accordance to a latest report.To assist these involved in the enterprise parent out how to launch a profession in software program engineering, we compiled the most essential small print and resources.INCREASED DEMAND FOR ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS?Today, electrical engineers are working tougher to educate innovate the brand new engineering Software technological know-how and integrating these improvements into new products. Electrical engineer and Software developer job positions dominated One of the 10 most in-demand tech jobs of 2019. The international demand for electrical engineers is high year over year, with demand for AR / VR engineers growing at 517% and safety engineers at 132%, in accordance to Hired’s 2019 State of Electrical Engineers report. The demand for Electrical engineers correlates with the Software skills and flows of new technology. For example, the demand of Augument Reality in the previous 12 months has resulted in a want for electrical engineers with the skills. Most organizations are attempting to remain competitive, ensuing in a higher funding in technological know-how throughout all sectors, in accordance to latest Economic Research. As extra corporations are making an attempt to radically change into tech companies, software program engineers are wished in these industries (retail, finance, manufacturing, etc.) to plan, manage, and launch the software.WHAT DOES A ELECTRICAL ENGINEER DO?Electrical engineers are intelligible for building, developing, launching, and preserving software program merchandise and systems, in accordance to Indeed’s profession guide. Software structures encompass working systems, enterprise applications, linked hardware, networking systems, and cellular and internet applications.Electrical engineers and software program builders are interconnected, however at the same time exclusive. Software builders assist hold current software program performance, advise improvements, and improve updates or new software program applications in code. The key distinction is in the phrase “engineer,” due to the fact engineers are concerned in the devel-opment of software, however developers don’t always have the electrical engineering history to be worried in that phase of the process.SOME SOFTWARE ENGINEER JOB ROLES?Software engineers can choose from a number of career paths. Here are the nine of the most popular software engineering jobs and their growth rates year over year, according to the Hired report.• Blockchain engineer (517%)• Security engineer (132%)• Embedded engineer (76%)• Data engineer (38%)• Back end engineer (33%)• Machine learning engineer (27%)• Mobile engineer (15%)• Full stack engineer (7%)• Front end engineer (4%)WHAT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES OR OTHER SKILLS ARE BEST TO LEARN TO BECOME A SOFTWARE ENGINEER?Software engineers usually have at least a bachelor’s in Electrical engineering or information technology. Those in the subject are regularly properly versed in software program improvement and have full-size journey working with a variety of programming languages, like Python, Java, and C++. The fastest-growing capabilities in 2020 for software program engineers consist of tools with Flutter, Android design, node.JS, non-stop integration and development, and angular material, in accordance to a LinkedIn report. For software program engineers in administration positions, or these making an attempt to attain administration level, smooth abilities are turning into increasingly more essential as well. To gas high-performing teams, software program engineering managers’ talent units should consist of human beings management, leadership, group management, group building, and strategic planning, the LinkedIn record found.WHERE CAN I FIND RESOURCES FOR A CAREER IN SOFTWARE ENGINEERING?There are many paths to turning into a software program engineer, and most humans take the one much less traveled, in accordance to Hired’s 2019 Software Engineering report, stated earlier.  While 46% of respondents begin their software program engineering careers by means of incomes a bachelor’s Degree or diploma in pc science, one in 5 stated they are self-taught. Some 13% of respondents stated they took a greater hybrid approach, taking benefit of developer bootcamps through agencies like Geek For Geek and Hack Rank.In phrases of mastering pinnacle programming languages, web sites like GitHub provide lots of courses and sources to get started.Coding bootcamps have validated to be extraordinarily recommended for software program engineers: 76% of bootcamp graduates stated the publications helped put together them for their software program engineering job. Bootcamps are a outstanding aid for electrical engineers searching to reskill, upskill, or destroy into the field, the Hired file said. For potential electrical engineers choose extra in-depth understanding on the topic, EdX gives masses of publications and diploma plans for software program engineers.

It says nothing about all the soft skills I’ve been able to build on, such as perseverance, diligence, taking initiative, communication, time management, “business talk interpretation”, etc.And that’s just at work….There’s been a lot going on, but during my time here so far, I’ve had a renewed desire to learn and do new things. I’m in the middle of a web development course in my spare time at the moment and I’m looking to do more with podcasting as well. I’m looking to ramp back up with selling shoes and possibly looking at selling some other products as well (resale; i.e buying low, selling high).I’m also learning how to take care of finances better. When you're on your own, if you want or need something, you better be ready to fork over the folding stuff yourself. So it’s been a good time to learn the difference between wants and needs.DoorDash has been interesting as well. Last night, Friday night, it was pouring. Friday evening is already a good day to deliver, and with it raining hard, I knew there would be even more people ordering. So I made sure to jump in on that. I turned on my app and I had an order before I was even out of my driveway. I drove from around 8 till near midnight.I’m so thankful for all the kind and helpful people God has allowed me to encounter in my time here so far and I look forward to the next month and months in North Carolina and at RoleModel Software.Everybody’s got a blank pageA story they’re writing todayA wall that they’re climbingYou can carry the past on your shouldersOr you can start overRegrets, no matter what you’ve gone throughJesus, He gave it all to save youHe carried the cross on His shouldersSo you can start overStart Over by Flame feat.

How is IFTTT’S new paid tier NOT ransomware?,https://medium.com/@adagioman4695/how-is-ifttts-new-paid-tier-not-ransomware-b5ce18fa3b7?source=tag_archive---------5-----------------------,"IFTTT,Ransomware,Software","I love a good piece of software. Something that fills a need, is well thought out, and works. Hell, if it’s good enough I’m more than happy to pay for it, That’s what happened with the Drafts app and Pocket for example.Some apps, however, are good but not good enough to pay extra for. This includes apps like Feedly, for instance, where the free option gives me everything I need. Evernote is the same. I don’t need the added functionality that the paid tier gives me. I’m happy to use the free version.That’s the work of well designed freemium software. You can use it for free at the base level but for additional functionality you pay a little more. That’s good business.The problem comes when you think a piece of software is free but it turns out the creators are actually holding you to ransom. That’s IFTTT. (If This Then That)IFTTT is a fantastic piece of software which allows you to set up a trigger in another app that can run an action in a third appAs an example, ‘whenever I post a photo to Twitter also post it to Facebook’. Or ‘whenever the New York Times posts a story to its media section save it to Pocket’. There are, literally, dozens and dozens of applications this works with and hundreds of different triggers that can invoke IFTTT to run. I’ve got ones set up to tweet a morning message every day. Ones to track whenever the ISS passes over my house and log it an a Google Sheet. Ones to send the XKCD comic to my email every morning. There’s even ones that can turn the lights on and off in your house according to sunrise and sunset times.Each of these little pieces of logic and routine is called an applet. Like many other users I have been using this software for years and have accumulated lots of applets. Almost 60, in fact. I would imagine some users have created many more. It’s become a part of my day-to-day life.Then IFTTT announced a ‘Pro’ version or their software. Added functionality. More logic. Better control. It was exactly what a Pro version of software should be.But it had one caveat.Unless you upgraded to Pro you would only be able to use 3 of your existing applets.Overnight I found myself in a position where I had to hand over a chunk of money each month to use my stuff or I would lose almost all of it.How is this not ransomware?This wasn’t a case of the company adding new functionality and asking the user to pay for that if they wanted to use it. This was the company adding new functionality and asking the user to pay for ALL functionality if they wanted to use it (apart from three applets-worth).Don’t get me wrong. I’m not saying a company shouldn’t be able to make money from its software. Far from it.What I am saying is holding users to ransom is not the way to do this.If they had started all these years back and said ‘Here’s our software. Learn how to use it and build 5 or 10 applets for free. Everything after that is an upgrade’ that would be fine.But they didn’t. They let their user base gorge themselves on this logic-based crack then – when we’re all addicted – they told us they’re withdrawing most of the supply unless we pay for it in future. Just like drug dealers. Also – like drug dealers – what they’re doing is immoral and wrong.IFTTT are trying to soften the blow by giving users the option to pay what they want for the Pro version for 12 months. After that it goes to $9.99 per month (unless the subscription price rises). But that’s not the point. They’ve fundamentally gone about this the wrong way. They’ve ruined a perfectly good piece of software for myself and – I have no doubt – for many other people.For that reason IFTTT can say goodbye to my potential subscription.Written byGary CWriter.

Brushing up linux and Git with crio.do,https://medium.com/@harshsrivastava-37801/brushing-up-linux-and-git-with-crio-do-2243ac7e19e2?source=tag_archive---------7-----------------------,"Software,Criodo,Learning,Linux,Git","In the world of software developers linux and version control with git hold huge importance. I already had prior experience with linux and git but Crio’s I believe in doing got me thinking why not brush up the basics.So I started with the september edition of “I believe in doing” by registering for the program. It was followed by a kickoff call with Sridher from Crio who gave a brief introduction to the wonderful world of linux followed by exciting examples. It was followed by a surprise challenge to automate backup of files using linux and git.I began with the linux and git bytes, which were pretty basic and easy to follow. Crio team has done a wonderful job making these bytes so beginner friendly. The best thing is that they provide virtual machines which people without linux on their PCs can use.After completing the bytes I began doing the surprise challenge. The first step was to write a script that pushes code to a remote repo on github. The steps I followed were : fetch, add, commit and push.The next step was to automate the running of the script. Thankfully linux has a built in automation facility called crontab, which allows commands to be run at specific intervals. I created my crontab to run the script at after every 30 minutes. And thus my very own backup system(someday hopefully as good as google drive :) ) was created.The entire experience with I believe in doing was great. As I had experience with crio launch, I knew that Crio would be wonderful with this program as well. Crio deserves appreciation for the work they are doing for the developer community :))Written byHarsh SrivastavaInterested in Tech, politics, theology, zoology and a lot moreFollowSoftwareCriodoLearningLinuxGitMore from Harsh SrivastavaFollowInterested in Tech, politics, theology, zoology and a lot moreMore From MediumBuild a simple web server with typescript and koaJean-Baptiste Terrazzoni in My 42 storiesThe iOS Application LifecycleLeela Krishna in HackerNoon.comReact Native Performance: Do and Don'tMaxence Dalmais in HackerNoon.comJavaScript: Four Ways to Remove a Value From an ArrayJonathan Hsu in Better ProgrammingV8 for Node.js developers at a glanceChen Cheng in JavaScript In Plain English4 Ways to Solve a Google Interview Question, in JavaScriptBret CameronSoftware Design: What is Acceptance Criteria and why do you need it?Lee McGowan in JavaScript In Plain EnglishPlease Put TypeScript Down for a MomentKris Guzman in Better ProgrammingAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

Its rapid spread across the globe has led to large-scale social disruption and economic loss, affecting 213 countries and territories with nearly 30 million cases reported worldwide.While this isn’t the first pandemic recorded in history, it could well be the first pandemic that can be controlled. The fundamentals of public health have proven successful to the containment of COVID-19. Scientists have discovered that the spread of infectious diseases depends on the pattern of contacts between individuals. Knowledge of these patterns is thus essential to inform models and develop effective strategies.One major tool for understanding these patterns is a method known as modeling & simulation. This practice has been employed over the years by epidemiologists and other related experts. I would like to highlight a particular tool in this article as an example of what this technique can offer.CLUBASID (Cluster Based Simulator for Infectious Diseases) is a software designed to simulate the spread of infectious diseases among population groups. It uses its highly visual elements to generate models that mimic patterns observed in occurrence of an outbreak.Users can input parameters and adjust them from an array of variables to tailor custom scenarios. These variables such as Land Area Occupied, Infection Rate, Health Categories, and so on can be paired with metrics obtained from mathematical data that can give insight as to how infectious diseases operate in the real world.CLUBASID software provides an intuitive graphical interface to set up simulations and evaluate them using graphs and built-in data analysis tools. Its visual presentation favors even non-technical experts making the process more flexible.Since development of this software began in March 2020, work towards its evolution has been ongoing and more features are being added to further improve it.The use of disease simulators is not, in any way, meant to be comprehensive but rather serves as a unique approach to provide references for the answers to some of the health challenges we face in our world today. While the health sector plays a central role, all other sectors, individuals, families, and communities must also play their part in mitigating the effects of infectious diseases.Written byVernon IloFollowHealthTechnologySoftwareCovid 19More from Vernon IloFollowAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Overview Ekstensi ERP: Modul ERP vs Aplikasi Proksi vs Aplikasi Utama,https://medium.com/@mufid.jamaluddin/overview-ekstensi-erp-modul-erp-vs-aplikasi-proksi-vs-aplikasi-utama-20da37c66319?source=tag_archive---------9-----------------------,"Software Development,Software,Enterprise Software,Enterprise Technology","Photo by Bayu Syaits on UnsplashHai teman-teman! Apakabar!. Jumpa lagi dengan saya, saya akan overview sedikit terkait dengan ekstensi aplikasi Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP). ERP merupakan aplikasi gede yang handle manajemen bisnis di suatu perusahaan yang terintegrasi antar domain bisnis-nya.Namun, dalam pembahasan kali ini, ERP yang dimaksud adalah aplikasi ERP jadi (nggak buat sendiri) seperti software Odoo dan SAP, dimana proses bisnis-nya udah jadi tinggal pakai.Istilah yang digunakan dalam artikel ini, dimana backend merupakan aplikasi yang tujuan utamanya itu handle business logic dan frontend merupakan aplikasi yang tujuan utamanya itu buat user-interface (UI, antarmuka aplikasi).Dalam pengembangan software baru dimana ada prekondisi organisasi atau perusahaan yang menggunakan ERP, ada tiga implementasi solusi:1. Modul Internal ERPBuat modul dalam internal ERP merupakan hal yang umum dilakukan bila ERP itu sifatnya open-source dan mampu diakses oleh banyak orang. Pastinya, Software Developer harus paham bagaimana ERP tersebut bekerja.2. Buat Aplikasi Proksi, Aplikasi ERP Itu Utama…Biasanya, aplikasi ERP berbayar seperti SAP itu sangat mahal dan biaya langganan yang naik turun tergantung kurs Rupiah-Dolar. Jatuhnya impor lisensi penggunaan aplikasi ERP, dan nggak semua organisasi atau perusahaan memiliki uang yang cukup untuk penggunaan ERP secara massal.Apalagi, semua proses bisnis utama ada dalam ERP-nya.Oleh karena itu, buat aplikasi proksi yang bisa diakses oleh banyak orang dan pembayaran lisensi lebih murah karena integrasi data.Hubungan antara aplikasi proksi dan ERP disarankan menggunakan paradigma asinkron, nggak boleh tembak langsung, karena bisa aja aplikasi ERP cuma satu server sedangkan aplikasi proksi bisa dioptimisasi jadi banyak server. Integrasi anatara aplikasi proksi bisa langsung pakai REST API atau scheduler dengan cron-job.Karena proses bisnis utamanya ada dalam ERP, maka Software Developer juga dituntut untuk paham perilaku dari ERP. Jika nggak, maka kemungkinan Business Error menanti.Jika sangat paham perilaku ERP, bukan cuma tahu bisnis dan pakai ERP, “Business Error” itu mustahil terjadi. Jika nggak terlalu paham perilaku ERP, maka bisa aja terjadi “Business Error” dalam proses internal aplikasi proksi. Akan tetapi, pemahaman kita siapa yang ukur? Oleh karena itu, paham atau nggak paham, skenario “Business Error” harus dihandle.Business Error itu dalam Sistem Informasi, menandakan analisis dan desain yang gagal, desain skema database yang jelek, dan lainnya. Harusnya, inputan pengguna ditolak masuk aplikasi bila datanya nggak konsisten.Tapi, Business Error itu wajar dalam aplikasi proksi yang hanya berperan sebagai frontend tambahan atas aplikasi ERP utama, bukan aplikasi backend utama yang handle proses bisnis. Skema database nya nggak normal, tapi disesuaikan dengan form inputan di ERP-nya.Jika teman-teman ingin tahu bagaimana cara buat aplikasi proksi, yuk baca artikel saya yang berjudul “Aplikasi Proksi SAP”.Aplikasi Proksi SAPDalam maintain proses bisnis saat ini dibutuhkan aplikasi yang dapat digunakan sebagai fasilitas bisnis dan organisasi…medium.com3. Aplikasi Utama, ERP juga Utama tapi Cuma Tambahan…Aplikasi utama dibuat dengan catatan proses bisnis utamanya yang dibangun ada dalam aplikasi utama, bukan ERP, dan ERP seperti SAP atau Odoo cuma aplikasi tambahan yang bisa diganti-ganti.Data dari aplikasi utama akan dilakukan sinkronisasi dengan aplikasi ERP baik dengan tools Messaging seperti Apache Kafka atau RabbitMQ, REST API, maupun scheduler cron-job.Hal ini dilakukan jika ERP-nya bukan tempat business logic utama, tapi hanya tempat untuk pantau satu domain bisnis atau satu tugas spesifik seperti akuntansi dan nggak mengurus domain bisnis lainnya. Bisa aja ada data multi-domain bisnis, tapi berperan sebagai CRUD frontend aja.Dengan demikian, Business Error seharusnya nggak pernah terjadi karena analisis dan desain dilakukan secara menyeluruh. Jika terjadi kesalahan integrasi dengan ERP, maka itu urusan tim yang handle ERP-nya, karena aplikasi utama itu dibuat secara mandiri dan terlepas dari teknologi lain maupun ERP lain.Catatan:Odoo, ERP Open SourceOpen Source ERP and CRM | OdooIf you have individual software solutions that work, but don't talk to each other, you are probably entering things…www.odoo.com2.

Apache Nedir?,https://medium.com/@celebiiimertt/apache-nedir-caf3016ea6c8?source=tag_archive---------10-----------------------,"Codernsoft,Apache,Servers,Https,Software","codernsoft-apacheApache nedir? Apache HTTP Sunucusu, web içeriğini internet üzerinden sağlayan ücretsiz ve açık kaynaklı bir web sunucusudur. Yaygın olarak Apache olarak anılır ve geliştirildikten sonra hızla web’deki en popüler HTTP istemcisi haline geldiApache Web Uygulama MimarisiApache, web içeriği sunmak için bir web uygulaması yığınında ihtiyaç duyulan bileşenlerden yalnızca biridir. En yaygın web uygulama yığınlarından biri LAMP veya Linux, Apache, MySQL ve PHP’yi içerir.Linux, uygulamanın işlemlerini gerçekleştiren işletim sistemidir. Apache, istekleri işleyen ve web varlıklarını ve içeriği HTTP aracılığıyla sunan web sunucusudur. MySQL, tüm bilgilerinizi kolayca sorgulanabilen bir biçimde depolayan veritabanıdır. PHP, dinamik web içeriği oluşturmaya yardımcı olmak için apache ile birlikte çalışan programlama dilidir.Web SunucusuApache nedir sorusumuz için devam ediyoruz,Apache tartışmasız internetteki en popüler web sunucularından biri olsa da, birçok başka oyuncu da var ve manzara her zaman değişiyor. 90'ların sonlarında ve 2000'lerin başında Apache’nin hakimiyeti çok güçlüydü ve internetin aktif web sitelerinin %50'sinden fazlasına hizmet ediyordu. Microsoft’un IIS (İnternet Bilgi Hizmetleri) de bir seçenekti ancak o kadar popüler değildi.Neden Apache Web Sunucuları?Apache, açık kaynaklı yazılım olarak kabul edilir, yani orijinal kaynak kodu görüntüleme ve işbirliği için ücretsiz olarak kullanılabilir. Açık kaynak olması, Apache’yi belirli işlevleri uygulamak ve temel özelliklerini geliştirmek için kendi modüllerini oluşturup yapılandıran geliştiriciler arasında çok popüler hale getirdi. Apache, 1995 yılından beri faaliyet göstermektedir ve internetin başlangıçtaki büyümesini hızlandırmaya yardımcı olan bir çekirdek teknoloji olarak sorumludur.Apache nedir sorumuz için özelliklerinden bahsedelim.Apache Web Sunucusunun ÖzellikleriStatik dosyaların işlenmesiYüklenebilir dinamik modüllerOtomatik indeksleme.htaccessIPv6 ile uyumluHTTP / 2'yi desteklerFTP bağlantılarıGzip sıkıştırma ve açmaBant genişliği azaltmaPerl, PHP, Lua betikleriYük dengelemeOturum takibiURL yeniden yazmaIP adresine göre konum belirlemeApache Web Sunucusu Nasıl Çalışır?Apache nedir nasıl çalışır sorumuz için Apache, TCP / IP protokolünü kullanarak istemciden sunucuya ağlar üzerinden iletişim kurmanın bir yolu olarak çalışır. Apache çok çeşitli protokoller için kullanılabilir, ancak en yaygın olanı HTTP/S’dir. HTTP/S veya Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (S, güvenli anlamına gelir), web’deki ana protokollerden biridir ve Apache’nin en çok bilinen protokollerinden biridir.Apache Web Sunucusunu Kimler Kullanır?Apache HTTP web sunucuları, dünyadaki tüm web sunucularının% 67'sinden fazlası tarafından kullanılmaktadır. Apache web sunucularının ortamları özelleştirmesi kolaydır, hızlıdır, güvenilirdir ve son derece güvenlidir. Bu, Apache web sunucularını sınıfının en iyisi şirketler tarafından ortak bir seçim haline getirir.Apache nedir sorumuz için alternatif sunuculardan da bahsedelim.Apache HTTP Sunucusu için AlternatiflerApache web sunucuları çok popüler olsa da, piyasadaki tek web sunucusu onlar değil.

The Demand for Cross Platform applications Continues to Increase,https://medium.com/@kerry-d/the-demand-for-cross-platform-applications-continues-to-increase-aae66da925ee?source=tag_archive---------11-----------------------,"Cross Platform,Software,Android,Apple","We constantly hear about the Apple ecosystem and now the Android ecosystem and even the Samsung ecosystem. These ecosystems are great for convenience until they begin to lock a user out that’s not part of the ecosystem.Where this is most problematic relates to software. If software only runs on an iPhone and is not available to the Android problems can ensue. These challenges are now starting to get quite problematic.WorkWhere the problem is the most prominent is at work. The world is becoming or has become a smaller place. The economy is now referred to as a global economy. Designs for product may originate in North America but the manufacturing is likely done elsewhere. Communication is thus critical like at no other time in history.Ecosystems can also be thought of as closed systems as opposed to open systems. Open systems are designed to work with other systems. In one’s personal life this may not be as critical as it is in the work environment but it’s annoying when you can’t work with someone else or receive information easily as a system works only in the ecosystem.The Demands of the TeamTeams are frequently formed in the work environment to tackle problems. As an example, a team is formed to work on a project to meet some desired goal. The team, to function at a minimum, needs to communicate fluidly.In today’s work environment, users are allowed to use their own smartphones. There are a lot of advantages for a business to allow this. When a team is formed, and of say ten people 7 are iPhone and 3 are Android users, they all need to be able to communicate in an entirely fluid fashion. You can think of their Smartphones as both gateways to information and the processors of informationFortunately, standards have always been prevalent with respect to communications protocols. People generally can email each other, text each other and use a shared chat system to work on the project.Difficulties tend to arise Around Critical ApplicationsWorkers work with applications such as task managers and project managers to get the job done. They use Databases and Notes applications and analytical tools to analyze information and come up with strategies and solutions. If some or all of the tools are systems dependent or closed there’s going to be a problem. You’re going to either have to work with work arounds or tools to cross the chasm which may not prove easy.What makes the process easier is if these applications are cross platform. That is they equally run on an Android and an iPhone. The more that applications are cross platform the easier the solution. The most appropriate tools can be brought to bear to solve the problem. This demand is simply increasing with time. It won’t go away. However, some developers are rigid in their approach not to make their applications cross platform. Long term, this will likely hurt the developer but in the short term it hurts the individual workers.Cross Platform tools will enable ProductivityIn the long run, there will continue to be a push to cross platform solutions. The more tools that work this way the more likely it is you can bring the right tool to the problem and further some tools already have a wealth of data that could get lost or at least not used.Manufacturers feel threatened that if they loose their closed ecosystem their competitive advantage could be washed away. This is a hard one. Apple’s ecosystem gives them competitive advantage but at the same time can hinder companies workflow. On the other hand, if they support open systems and protocols they will enable solutions that are difficult for one supplier to do it all.Regardless, market forces are at work making this a reality. Software Developers like Evernote ensure they run in numerous environments giving competitive leverage. This then encourages competition developers to do the same thing.As time has passed, we have moved from very closed systems to more open systems. Likely this trend will continue improving the solutions delivered and the output of corporate and personal workers.Written byKerry DawsonKerry Dawson primarily writes articles on today’s tech.

Planning Food Cost For Retirement-How To Achieve The Money You Need To Retire Comfortably On,https://medium.com/@eliasbounenni1999/planning-food-cost-for-retirement-how-to-achieve-the-money-you-need-to-retire-comfortably-on-dde71cdb05e3?source=tag_archive---------13-----------------------,"Planning Food Cost,For Retirement,Retirement Planning,Software,Calculator","Many people forget during their retirement planning to plan for each and every expense that will arise during their retirement. This is exactly the reason the vast majority of Americans get to their retirement years and find they don’t have enough money to retire on.According to the Social security administration, 95% of people will not be able to retire comfortably.

This is exactly the reason the vast majority of Americans get to their retirement years and find they don’t have enough money to retire on.According to the Social security administration, 95% of people will not be able to retire comfortably. Unfortunately, this stat could have been alleviated by most people from some simple and thorough planning for the costs they will be faced with after retirement.Of course, food cost is one of the biggies that most people overlook when planning this important stage. Most people get so caught up in planning for their housing, cars, and other larger expenses, they forget about this everyday, seemingly trivial expenses. Obviously, as I’m sure you are aware of now, food costs can really add up if you’re not careful.In planning for these food costs for retirement, first of all, sit down and figure out exactly what you spend on food every week now. Now figure out how much that figure is per month, and then per year. You should already be doing this process now in keeping track of your expenses, and most people do a very poor job of tracking their expenses before retirement as well. However, that’s another story for another day.Once you’ve gotten this figured out, now simply multiply that number by about 25 or 30 (usually safe) and you’ve got about how much money you will need for your food expenses when you retire. Of course, this number isn’t perfect, depending on how long you live once you retire. Obviously, you don’t know this, so you have to at least do what you can.Once you know this, that’s great, but you also have to take into consideration your other expenses as well. In your retirement planning process, every expense must be accounted for; without this clarity, you can never achieve your retirement goals, whatever they may be. Unfortunately, it’s this same lack of clarity that stops most people from having enough money when they retire.In this process, there is a lot of great retirement planning software that will make this stage much easier. Also, you might try doing a quick internet search for retirement planning calculator, and you will get up literally millions of results. There are many financial companies that will offer you these calculators for free so that you use them and hopefully get hooked on ultimately hiring that company and their services. Whether you do this or not, you can certainly still benefit from the free software available.Now, once you know this info, you need to figure out how you plan on getting that money to live on. For most people, this will be achieved thought the stock market, whether it be mutual funds, savings bonds, foreign currency exchange, futures, or regular stock investing.Of course, you can also invest in real estate and other assets as well. If you aren’t financially educated and don’t know how to tell a good investment from a bad one, you’ll either want to read books and educate yourself, or hire a financial advisor to tell you the best investments to put your money into. Obviously, becoming financially educated yourself is certainly preferably, because you will have the opportunity to spot investment opportunities on your own.Remember, nobody else will ever care as much about your financial situation as you, so being able to do this is invaluable. However, the most important part at this state is to either use your own or somebody else’s expertise to help you find the top investment vehicle to help you achieve your goals.Once you’ve done these planning food cost for retirement and other expenses steps, and decided on the right investment vehicle to get you there, you are well on your way to achieving your goals. Now it’s simply time to take action.Written byDigitalforlessWe Provide Premium Digital Products To Help Graphic Designers, Developers, Entrepreneurs, And Content Creators To Level Up For A Affordable Price!FollowPlanning Food CostFor RetirementRetirement PlanningSoftwareCalculatorMore from DigitalforlessFollowWe Provide Premium Digital Products To Help Graphic Designers, Developers, Entrepreneurs, And Content Creators To Level Up For A Affordable Price!More From MediumLarge Purchase Decisions: 14 Questions To Ask Yourself to Avoid RegretKaren MacKenzieConquer Your Student LoansAdam Parsons in Making of a Millionaire4 Practical Ways I Changed How I Save My MoneyRyan Fulton in The Post-Grad Survival GuideMOAM in the Military: The U.S. Tax CodeDanial Hallock in Making of a MillionaireWe Need to Break the Money TabooRyan Fulton in Making of a MillionaireDon’t Even Think About Retiring Until You Can Answer These 3 QuestionsStaff in The Motley FoolTen Financial Goals to Aim for in the Next Six MonthsKaren Banes in Making of a MillionaireHow I Thrived Earning Less Than Minimum WageStephen Moore in The Post-Grad Survival GuideAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

Aplicação de soft skills para melhorar seu desenvolvimento de software.,https://medium.com/@eduardolomb/aplica%C3%A7%C3%A3o-de-soft-skills-para-melhorar-seu-desenvolvimento-de-software-f41391e478a9?source=tag_archive---------2-----------------------,"Desenvolvimento,Soft Skills,Software,Comunica","Photo by Kelly Sikkema on UnsplashEstá começando na área de desenvolvimento? Já desenvolve a uns 2 anos e não sabe para onde ir? Tentarei ajudar neste artigo. Tenho focado minha carreira no desenvolvimento mobile para plataformas Apple iOS mas as dicas aqui servem para todas as áreas do desenvolvimento.Inicio: Está começando agora e está com medo, ansioso? Não fique. O mercado está cheio de gente trabalhando pra caramba para fazer as empresas crescerem. O mínimo necessário é um senso de responsabilidade para não remar contra a maré. Uma palavra importante, responsabilidade.Aprendizado: Leve o seu trabalho como um grande aprendizado. Geralmente o que acontece no dia a dia é totalmente diferente do que você aprendeu no curso / faculdade. Não hesite em pedir ajuda, pra quem quer que seja. Aprenda sobre o produto que está desenvolvendo, procure saber como ele funciona, mesmo que não seja sua tarefa. Demonstre interesse.Comunicação: Comunicação é essencial. Geralmente, as coisas dão errado ou não vão pra frente por falha na comunicação. Deixe seus gestores cientes do que está acontecendo. Conte para seus colegas de trabalho sobre o que está fazendo. Pergunte para seus colegas de trabalho, se tiver alguma dúvida.Datas: No mundo do desenvolvimento tudo tem uma data de entrega, mesmo que ela não tenha sido passada a você. Na maioria dos cenários, essa data é flexível. Mas isso se torna uma via de mão dupla. A data de entrega é postergada, mas a entrega deve ser feita na melhor qualidade possível e a maioria dos problemas encontrados devem ser solucionados.Erros: Errar é normal, acontece. O que importa é o tamanho dos erros e sua repetição. Se você consegue se manter focado para fazer o que tem de ser feito, pede ajuda quando precisa, vai atrás de solução para os problemas que encontra, comunica as pessoas em sua volta de tudo isso, diminui bastante a chance de cometer algum erro.Ajuda: Você está pedindo ajuda quando precisa, trocando idéia com os colegas de trabalho, agora pode começar a ajudar quem precisa. Entrou um cara novo na equipe (ou no projeto), algum colega de trabalho está passando pelo mesmo problema que você passou mês passado. Não se preocupe porque a troca de experiência nunca será uma perda de tempo.Bugs: Eles estão por aí, soltos, aos montes. (Se não existem algo está errado nos testes). É o caminho mais fácil para se familiarizar com o projeto. Os pequenos bugs te ajudam a entender a estrutura do código. Com o tempo, a correção dos bugs se torna instigante. Como você já vai ter passado por boa parte do código para resolver um problema, na hora de implementar uma solução já vai ter o caminho das pedras na cabeça.Humildade: Seja humilde. Ninguém nasce sabendo de tudo e ninguém (muito menos eu) sabe de tudo. Vale a pena perder um tempo para explicar uma coisa para outra pessoa que demonstra não saber muito sobre o tema (o que é diferente de desinteresse).Leve estas dicas para o dia a dia. Procure sempre sair com algum conhecimento novo após um dia de trabalho. Vai compensar e te ajudar a progredir na carreira.Written byEduardo LombardiFollow1 1 1 DesenvolvimentoSoft SkillsSoftwareComunicaçãoMore from Eduardo LombardiFollowMore From MediumDonald Trump Won, No Matter What Happens NextJessica Wildfire in The Apeiron BlogThe Election Should Never Have Been This Closeumair haque in Eudaimonia and Co20 Things Most People Learn Too Late In LifeNicolas Cole in Better Advice(Why) There Was no Biden Landslideumair haque in Eudaimonia and CoThis Is ‘I Wish a Motherf*cker Would’ Week for Black PeopleMarley K. in ZORAMy daughter was a creative genius, then we bought her an iPhoneStephanie Gruner Buckley in Modern ParentI Worked the Polls in Trump Country — and Left More Confused Than EverAaron Gell in GENTop lessons learned from working with a 10x developerJeffrey Bakker in Level Up CodingAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
A Short Guide to What a Learning Management System Is,https://medium.com/dev-genius/a-short-guide-to-what-a-learning-management-system-is-53c04763bbca?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"Elearning,Lms,Software,App Development,Software Development","Educational and training programs for employees are common for many businesses, and with an LMS, companies can significantly reduce time and money investments in such training. So what is LMS, how to choose the proper one, what are the system’s prime functions and benefits, and what should a modern LMS offer in terms of functionality? Let’s figure that out!What Is LMS?LMS, which stands for Learning Management System, is an ‘engine’ of eLearning that helps in creating, managing, and delivering any types of courses. Each LMS is made up of two crucial elements: a server component and a UI.The first one is responsible for the provision of the core functionality, including authentication, delivery of notifications, data management, etc.The latter is the visual representation of what happens in the engine, so administrators, instructors, students, and other types of users can use LMS with ease.What Are the Types of LMS?Not all LMS are equal. Actually, based on requirements, it is possible to choose from different options. First of all, Learning Management Systems fall into free and commercial ones.Open Source or Commercial LMSWhen it comes to choosing between free and commercial options, it is important to consider the benefits and pitfalls each of these types offers, to make the right, long-running decision.The most evident benefit of the open-source software is that it comes for free. Nevertheless, free options are often designed for sophisticated users and require support services to help a novice user.In contrast to the open-source, commercial software is built in the way to be tailored to specific users’ needs and that is why it’s much easier to use for beginners, as well as easier to deploy. But the pitfall is that such a solution usually comes at a significant price. Nevertheless, it pays for itself.Commercial software comes in two forms: Cloud and On-premises. Let’s look at each in more detail.Cloud or On-Premises LMSIn most cases, scalable commercial learning management systems are available as:On-premise, or locally hosted solutionsAlthough the locally hosted LMS can be customized, upgraded, and supported on the side of its owner, it requires having an internal IT team. So the solution becomes the best pick for companies having the IT staff in place.Cloud, or hosted on the vendor’s side solutionsCommonly, it’s coming in the form of Software as a Service (SaaS). When it comes to cloud solutions, the monthly support and upgrades are done on the side of the vendor, ensuring easy scaling ups and downs when needed.There are also variations with integrated solutions, as well as those capable and incapable of creating learning courses.LMS primary functionsDespite the fact that modern LMS shares a set of functions, there are two crucial ones: training facilitation and cost reduction.LMS for Facilitated TrainingThis function is achieved through generation, distribution, and tracking of employees’ training. Furthermore, an LMS ensures that the training itself will be more exciting and interesting for those undergoing it, meaning that the material will be learned better. When it comes to statistics, it shows that training with LMS tends to increase retention rates by 25 to 60 %, while traditional training results are only by 8 to 10 %.LMS for Cost ReductionIt is true that the development of an LMS requires significant money investments but the truth is that in most cases, the system pays for itself. One of the best proofs of that can be seen in the example of the Cisco company that cut its overall training costs by about 40% to 60% with LMS. The trick is that eLearning frees companies from investments associated with renting physical learning spaces/classrooms, as well as hiring professionals and constantly spending money on paper-based products.Both functions are very beneficial for businesses. Nevertheless, the list of advantages offered by LMS is not limited by these two, so let’s see what else it has on offer.Key Benefits of Learning Management Systems SoftwareIf we generalize the benefits of LMS, streamlined learning activities are becoming its crucial benefit. And here are how learning management systems make it possible:Easily accessible trainingLMS can work on both desktops, web, and mobile, in this way opening more opportunities for training.Tailored training sessionsWith an LMS, it is possible to adjust your training program to any type of user, whether a novice or the one mastering the gained skills.All learning materials in one placeThe convenience of having all the needed training materials in one place and available on the go ensures more efficient and productive training.Embedded analyticsAnalytics tools in LMS ensure your ability to analyze learning patterns and adjust the system for more personalized learning, which results in better outcomes.Automated learning processesThere’s no need to waste time on such important yet time-consuming tasks as scheduling, invitations, and follow-up support.As you can see, LMS impacts eLearning in the most beneficial way. But as soon as systems differ one from another, choosing or developing the one requires paying attention to features.Key Features of Modern LMSSo what are the must-have features of a modern learning management system? The top 10 include:For sure, these are just general requirements that will ensure your system’s modernity. Nevertheless, you may not need some of the above-mentioned features or require some other for successful performance. The best thing is that you can literally include anything you need, building your system in the way to be tailored to your company’s specific needs and goals.The Bottom LineOffering wide functionality, automating certain tasks, and providing a range of benefits, LMS became a powerful tool for companies handling eLearning courses. Nevertheless, a broad range of opportunities such systems have on offer can sometimes be confusing, especially when it comes to the development stage. So in addition to creating a clear picture of what needs to be done, companies should also pay a lot of attention to choosing a vendor.At Emerline, we generally start cooperation with consulting services that include a deep analysis of your business for the definition of its key goals, perspectives, and desired outcomes. On the basis of the analysis, our specialists provide you with a comprehensive picture of the solution that will work for your business success and, after agreeing with you on all the details, we assemble a team of specialists who will make it come true.We take advantage of the latest tools and technologies, deliver on time and within a predefined budget, and take every step needed to ensure fruitful cooperation.

What is Tech Debt?,https://medium.com/@fearlessbmore/what-is-tech-debt-cf38450c99ac?source=tag_archive---------5-----------------------,"Tech,Govtech,Digital Transformation,Technolog,Software","A guest post from Fearless Software Engineer Nicole Zonnenberg.If you work in tech, you work with tech debt. This term was coined for the purpose of informing a non-technical audience, usually, clients or product owners who are invested in the final product. It is a metaphor-based on financial debt, a concept that clients or product owners are more likely to be familiar with. However, there are stark differences to what financial debt means and what technical debt implies.Financial debt is the amount of non-operational debt (such as paying suppliers for goods and services) that a company has. The concept or presence of financial debt is not a blocker but a necessary cost of running a business.Tech is often the product or service of a business and therefore does not follow all of the same rules as a business. Tech is, more often than not, an amalgamation of different types of technologies and skills. Even in just the code base, the team is probably implementing different code languages and libraries in the backend and frontend. All of these components are being maintained by their own teams, constantly improving and publishing improved versions of their products. Or in some cases, becoming defunct as they are abandoned for different solutions.Unlike financial debt, tech debt accrues even if the engineering team does as little as possible. So long as the technical product or service exists, technical debt will accumulate. There is no paying it off, there is no setting the ledger to zero.Tech debt, while it shares a small similarity with financial debt, is something to stay in front of rather than on top of.It is not only possible for technology to become outdated, it is inevitable. The longer these technical tasks are ignored, the more effort they require to address.Tech debt is not itself a good or service to keep the product status as relevant. Rather it is the constant improvement of existing code, from renaming variables to maintain consistency in language and content as resources and skills evolve, to overhauling architecture. Constant code improvement is the tech debt equivalent of servicing a financial debt; it is what keeps the debt from growing.It is imperative for a team to include time for the engineering team to address tech debt, to audit their code and to stay abreast of any relevant library, technical, and skill updates. The level of effort will fluctuate depending on what is being updated or becoming defunct. The ability for a team to stay ahead of their tech debt will correlate with the efficiency of the tech product’s code and functionality.Written byFearlessHi, we’re Fearless, a full stack digital services firm in Baltimore that builds software with a soul. https://fearless.techFollowTechGovtechDigital TransformationTechnologSoftwareMore from FearlessFollowHi, we’re Fearless, a full stack digital services firm in Baltimore that builds software with a soul. https://fearless.techMore From MediumRemote Development with PycharmJoseph RobinsonThe curious case of Pagination for Gremlin queriesJayanta MondalBeing a less frustrated programmerKevin Nuut in The StartupMoving to Intermediate — Any Kid Can CodeLaxman Singh in The StartupHow to List All Primes up to 1000 in PythonRebeca Ansar in An AmygdalaMigrating from Relay to Apollo in create-react-native-appRishi Raj in The StartupReact Native vs. Its Alternatives: Is The Latter Better?Christian FeldbacherHow to Run Spring Boot Application on Raspberry Pi Using DockerAntti Havanko in The StartupAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

7 Laws That Software Engineer Must Know,https://levelup.gitconnected.com/7-laws-that-software-engineer-must-know-40775650f824?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Software,Engineering,Law,Principles,Programming","Photo by Bill Oxford on UnsplashThere are lots of laws that people discuss when talking about development. Most engineers like to talk about some principles and patterns without realizing there is a certain name of law associate with them. There are several occasions where senior engineers assume that junior doesn’t know a certain principle just because they have no idea what a law means.This list contains an explanation of some laws, principles, and patterns, but does not advocate for any of them. Whether they should be applied will always be a matter of debate, and greatly dependent on what you are working on. Let’s start with the most popular one.Murphy’s Law / Sod’s LawMurphy’s Law on WikipediaAnything that can go wrong will go wrong.Related to Edward A. Murphy, Jr, Murphy’s Law states that if a thing can go wrong, it will go wrong.This is a common adage among developers. Sometimes the unexpected happens when developing, testing, or even in production. This can also be related to the (more common in British English) Sod’s Law:If something can go wrong, it will, at the worst possible time.Phenomena such as Confirmation Bias and Selection Bias can lead people to perhaps over-emphasize these laws (the majority of times when things work, they go unnoticed, failures however are more noticeable and draw more discussion).Despite how popular these laws are and seem like natural understanding for engineers, people like to fall into their own assumptions and leading to failures and screwups.The Law of DemeterThe Law of Demeter on WikipediaDon’t talk to strangers.The Law of Demeter, also known as “The Principle of Least Knowledge” is a principle for software design, particularly relevant in object-orientated languages. The Law of Demeter is a specific case of loose coupling.It states that a unit of software should talk only to its immediate collaborators. An object A with a reference to an object B can call its methods, but if B has a reference to an object C, A should not call Cs methods. So, if C has a doThing() method, A should not invoke it directly; B.getC().doThis().The rules of LoD on Wikipedia are:Each unit should have only limited knowledge about other units: only units related to the current unit.Each unit should only talk to its friends; don’t talk to strangers.Only talk to your immediate friends.Following this principle limits the scope of changes, making them easier and safer in the future. It also lays a notion that a given object should assume as little as possible about the structure or properties of anything else (including its subcomponents).Premature Optimization EffectPremature Optimization on WikiWikiWebPremature optimization is the root of all evil.In Donald Knuth’s paper Structured Programming With Go To Statements, he wrote: “Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered. We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil. Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%.”However, Premature Optimization can be defined (in less loaded terms) as optimizing before we know that we need to.Cunningham’s LawCunningham’s Law on WikipediaThe best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question, it’s to post the wrong answer.According to Steven McGeady, Ward Cunningham advised him in the early 1980s: “The best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question, it’s to post the wrong answer.” McGeady dubbed this Cunningham’s law, though Cunningham denies ownership calling it a “misquote.” Although originally referring to interactions on Usenet, the law has been used to describe how other online communities work (e.g., Wikipedia, Reddit, Twitter, Facebook).Kernighan’s LawDebugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.Kernighan’s Law is named for Brian Kernighan and derived from a quote from Kernighan and Plauger’s book The Elements of Programming Style:Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the first place. So if you’re as clever as you can be when you write it, how will you ever debug it?While hyperbolic, Kernighan’s Law makes the argument that simple code is to be preferred over complex code, because debugging any issues that arise in complex code may be costly or even infeasible.Linus’s LawLinus’s Law on WikipediaGiven enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.This law simply states that the more people who can see a problem, the higher the likelihood that someone will have seen and solved the problem before, or something very similar.Although it was originally used to describe the value of open-source models for projects it can be accepted for any kind of software project. It can also be extended to processes — more code reviews, more static analysis, and multi-disciplined test processes will make the problems more visible and easy to identify.A more formal statement can be:Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and can be solved by someone who has encountered a similar problem before.This law was named in honor of Linus Torvalds in Eric S. Raymond’s book “The Cathedral and the Bazaar”.Moore’s LawMoore’s Law on WikipediaThe number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years.Often used to illustrate the sheer speed at which semiconductor and chip technology has improved, Moore’s prediction has proven to be highly accurate over from the 1970s to the late 2000s. In more recent years, the trend has changed slightly, partly due to physical limitations on the degree to which components can be miniaturized. However, advancements in parallelization, and potentially revolutionary changes in semiconductor technology and quantum computing may mean that Moore’s Law could continue to hold true for decades to come.As you guys may know, there are a lot of other laws out there except for these 7 I picked. Personally I pick these ones because I’ve heard at least once or twice these laws being mentioned.Even though following every law won’t help us become the best engineer, knowing what it means can help us to understand when the law is being mentioned in either discussion or interview.One man’s “magic” is another man’s engineering. “Supernatural” is a null word.Level Up CodingCoding tutorials and news.Follow47 SoftwareEngineeringLawPrinciplesProgramming47 claps47 clapsWritten byJeffry TandionoFollowPersonal Growth Enthusiast | Software Developer | Love sharing | Check my stuff out!FollowLevel Up CodingFollowCoding tutorials and news.

Coding Challenge Interview,https://medium.com/swlh/coding-challenge-interview-9b165b3d3dd9?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Programming,Software,Interview,Interview Questions","Source: https://unsplash.com/The coding challenge is a very common step in developer interviews. This step usually comes before or after the technical interview and can be done in two forms.In the first form, the recruiter sends you a description of the coding challenge via email or another means and asks you to solve it on your own, from home. With this approach, they usually tell you how long they expect the coding challenge would take to be solved; but most of the time there is no hard limit on how much time you can spend on it. Especially, if you want to go the extra mile by doing some extra improvements.The second strategy for the recruiter will be to have the coding challenge in the presence of some other developers in their office. There is a bit of more pressure on you as a candidate since you are expected to think on the spot and come up with a solution for the coding challenge. But I came to find that most of the recruiters mostly care about how you approach solving the problem, more than your final solution.No matter which format the coding challenge comes in, there are few things to keep in mind for making a bigger impression on the recruitment team:Try to host your final work on a website like Github: Nowadays, most of the dev teams are relying on git for managing their code. No matter how skilled you are, it is not so hard to push your coding challenge code to a Github repository with a nice read.me file and clear commit messages. This shows professionalism and makes reviewing your work easier, especially if you were asked to solve the coding challenge from home.It is always a good sign for a developer to write test cases for their code. It shows that they care about the maintainability of their code which could make the life of other developers on the team easier. Obviously, testing comes in different flavors like integration tests, e2e tests, or unit test. I would argue that writing individual unit tests for the core functionalities of the coding challenge is the best approach.Do not be afraid to go the extra mile, but try not to get too side-tracked as well. The recruitment team would appreciate it if you thought outside of the box a bit and did some sort of improvement to the original spec of the coding challenge they presented to you. For example, they might have asked you to build a simple to-do list; but you could go the extra mile and add some nice icons and fonts and spend a bit of time styling it for a more appealing look. But the catch here is that the coding challenge should be fixed before adding any improvements. This is how you are going to plan your tasks as a junior developer anyway, so better be prepared from it from day one.Do your study by checking or asking for their tech stack and try to use some of their tools in solving your coding challenge. Not only this will familiarize you with how they are solving their problems but will have a nice impact on their evaluation of you since they are more familiar with the tools they use on a regular day-to-day basis. Having said that, adding the tools you are familiar with into the mix is also a very good idea.Do your best to have a clean code structure. This means that it is much more readable to separate different parts of the functionality into separate files rather than having everything glued together in a single file. Also, add comments to parts of the code that are not very easy to understand, to show that you care about other developers being able to pick up your logic in the code easier.After successfully solving the coding challenge, you might get called for the next interview which is called: coding challenge review meeting. But what is this meeting about?So what is the coding challenge review meeting about?it is common for companies to call you for this meeting to discuss your approach in solving your coding challenge. At this point, the recruitment team has checked your solution, either manually by some of their own developers or having some sort of automatic check that run your code against some pre-defined tests. Either way. if you were called in for a coding challenge review, it means that your solution passed a certain level of quality and now they want to discuss its details with you.One thing you need to remember is that companies receive a few very good or very bad coding challenge solutions, but they receive a lot of average ones. If the recruiters behind the company are smart enough, they know that is is not practical to only hire people with very good solutions. A lot of times, later-to-become rock star developers deliver an average coding solution. So at this point, it is their job to evaluate your work as well as your work personality to see if they can bring you onboard and make you a good investment for the future of the company.So let’s break down what they are looking for.Code Review AssessmentWell, the recruiters have somehow assessed you on the technical part when you did the technical interview and coding challenge. So this meeting is their chance to test your general knowledge about coding.They might ask to follow up questions about the architectural decisions or concepts behind your solution. They want to see if you followed any code best practices, or have thought of any scenario that they did not mention in the challenge itself. This is your time to give them enough clarifications about the technical decisions you made in your solution.One common approach is that senior developers on the team try to make you think about another aspect of the coding challenge to see how you might react to unknown or difficult problems. For example, you might have been asked to use an API to fetch some data and show it on a page, but somebody might ask you if you have thought about caching the API responses, so you do not have to make unnecessary API calls. If you do not have a clear answer for those kinds of questions, it is important to stay calm and turn it into a conversation so you can show your way of discussing an unknown issue with the team, even though you might not have 100% of the answer.Working Personality AssessmentHiring a developer is expensive in many parts of the world, so they want to make sure they have chosen the right candidate for the job. There are a few things you can do to show them you are the candidate they are looking for:Embrace the feedback they give you: It is never a good sign to get defensive about your way of coding or your ideas. This is a perfect learning opportunity, especially for Junior developers. So try to listen eagerly and respond positively to their feedbackShow that you are a good team player and include everybody in the conversation. Show them a glimpse of how you can be their future teammate by practicing pair programming and live code debugging. Do not forget to ask deeper questions about the subjects that come up in the discussion.In the end try to show your unique personality traits or what makes you, you. Discuss your hobbies, interests, and passions in a realistic way. This makes you seem like a more competent candidate if done right.And most importantly. do not forget that smile and show them how awesome you are and how great it would be if they have you as a teammate.The StartupMedium's largest active publication, followed by +723K people.

Top 11 Newsletters For Developers,https://levelup.gitconnected.com/top-11-newsletters-for-developers-48692323983c?source=tag_archive---------2-----------------------,"Programming,JavaScript,Kotlin,Software,Flutter","Photo by Nijwam Swargiary on UnsplashA good newsletter is curated by someone who knows the topic inside and out. You don’t have to waste your time hunting for knowledge. And that is why there is a lot of newsletters out there. So, I decided to spend some time and put all of them together in one list. You will find the top 11 newsletters for developers.I hope this list helps you find more valuable content and keeps you updated with the latest news and trends that exist out there. It contains newsletters for Kotlin, GraphQL, Flutter, Distributed Systems, Frontend, and Databases.But before we get into the list I would like to share this amazing chrome extension that gives you a list of articles whenever you open up a new tab. It is called Daily. You don’t have to go anywhere and you can receive information for the topics you care about.Screenshot from the author of chrome’s new tab.NewslettersI have personally benefitted from newsletters by getting the right information. And one really important aspect of subscribing to newsletters is the reminder that you get every time you receive an email. It motivates you to read and more often than not you end up reading something new!#1 Kotlin WeeklyA weekly dose of Kotlin with great articles to read ranging from Kotlin for Backend, Android and multiplatform. Kotlin has become my favourite pretty quickly and I have used it in Backend and Android development. I have shared the benefits of Kotlin in this post.I really enjoyed reading this article in issue #213. If you are into FP you will enjoy reading that. It explains how to do FP in Kotlin using Arrow.#2 GraphQL WeeklyA vibrant ecosystem of content, talks, and guides. GraphQL is gaining popularity and getting into the mainstream. Having multiple benefits over REST, it makes it easier for clients to access only the required data. Github is using GraphQL APIs and you should check that out yourself. I have written another article about my experience using GraphQL for 6 months here.One of the recent articles from the newsletter that I liked is this one. Talks about how GitHub’s mobile applications have used GraphQL to power new features.#3 Flutter WeeklyFlutter ecosystem is rapidly growing and for a good reason. This newsletter provides the best content published in the Flutter community by authors around the world. Flutter lowers the bar to entry for building apps. It speeds up the development of apps and reduces the cost and complexity of app production across platforms.You should try it for yourself with this beginner tutorial that implements a calculator.#4 Distributed SystemsAll things related to distributed architecture and systems. With blogs, videos and books giving you insights on microservices, tracing, data lakes, databases etc. This is one of my favourites newsletters, simply because I have been working with micro-services architecture for a while now. I have gotten plenty of insights with the articles curated in this newsletter. One of the recent issues had a great resource with loads of concepts around Architectural Patterns for resilient systems.#5 Frontend FocusThis newsletter, formerly named HTML5 Weekly, from Cooper Press (as a number of inclusions in this post are) focuses on web standards, HTML, CSS and related technologies. I am a noob when it comes to frontend technologies, and I try to keep myself up to date by reading a few blogs from this newsletter.#6 Frontend WeeklyFrontend Weekly covers similar topics to Frontend Focus (i.e. web standards, HTML, CSS) but often with very different links.#7 Node WeeklyA Cooper Press newsletter focused on the Node ecosystem or relevant articles on the JavaScript language.#8 HackernewsletterA weekly newsletter of the best articles on startups, technology, programming, and more. All links are curated by hand from the popular Hacker News site.#9 DB WeeklyA weekly round-up of database technology news and articles covering new developments, SQL, NoSQL, document databases, graph databases, and more.#10 NoSQL WeeklyA free weekly newsletter featuring curated news, articles, new releases, events, tools and libraries, jobs etc related to NoSQL.#11 Python WeeklyA free weekly newsletter featuring curated news, articles, software, events, tools and libraries, jobs etc related to python.Other Interesting Articles:Lessons I’ve Learned in 5 Years as a Software Engineer“What Got You Here Won’t Get You There” — Marshall Goldsmithlevelup.gitconnected.com5 Mindsets of Unsuccessful Developers#3 Learning only happens on the joblevelup.gitconnected.comLevel Up CodingCoding tutorials and news.Follow176 1 Thanks to Trey Huffine. ProgrammingJavaScriptKotlinSoftwareFlutter176 claps176 claps1 responseWritten byManish JainFollowThe medium is the message — Marshall McLuhan | Pragmatic thinker | Glass half-full 🥃| Coding and writing stuff for humans | Senior Engineer at OLX Group BerlinFollowLevel Up CodingFollowCoding tutorials and news.

The GitHub Student Developer Pack,https://medium.com/@osamaakhtar15/the-github-student-developer-pack-aadde59290ff?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"Github,Software,Computer Science,Github Student,Github Education","You might be a programming enthusiast who just got accepted in your dream college or you might even have spent a good year or two in computer science discipline and barely know about GitHub.GitHub is a version control where code lives. It is where people share their hard work for others to see and contribute to. It is used by companies like Google, Microsoft amongst many others to maintain their codebase.But to a student it provides much more than that. GitHub has a Student Developer Pack which they provide to students. This pack includes benefits worth a whopping $200k!How do I apply?This program requires you to:Be a student having a GitHub account;13+ years old.Be in any degree-granting program that isn’t restricted by the institution’s accreditation.Provide an evidence of your being a student. This could be your school issued email-address, your school ID card or any other form of documentation.If you check out these requirements, you are all in for it! You just need to apply for the pack. You will be asked to fill out a short form where you will be asked basic information including an image of your academic status (ID card, for instance). It is necessary that you fill valid information and upload a clear, decipherable image, or else you could risk getting rejected (see this to avoid getting rejected).Okay, but why should I apply?This is the exciting part. When I found about the Student Pack, I was overwhelmed by the developer tools I was going to get — for free!Ranging from developer tools to productivity, GitHub is committed to give facilities to students that will help them learn, be more productive with their time and get acquainted with technologies, technologies that a college student does not usually have the budget to afford.The program also includes free subscriptions (either limited or unlimited) to educational sites like AWS Educate and DataCamp. This provides them an opportunity to introduce themselves to new and trending sub-disciplines of software, and potentially master them!So if you dream of becoming a game developer, a web developer or a designer, you cannot miss this pack. You can view the details of the tools provided by this program here.Sounds interesting, does the program expire?Yes, this program is only for students and will expire after two years since the day of acceptance. But you can always renew your subscription if you are still a student!I am amazed, what else does GitHub offer me?The Student Developer Pack is definitely A large chunk of the benefits they provide students, but other significant incentives are also included:1. GitHub Campus Expert Program:If you feel the need to lead a team to promote tech in your local campus by carrying out workshops and hackathons, this program would make you capable of doing so. It has a dedicated training that helps you improve your skills like public speaking, leadership etc. Read this article by a GitHub Campus Expert to get valuable insights about this program.2. Throw a hackathon or a small event at your college:GitHub can help you ship a 1000$ grant through their links with Major League Hacking (MLH). This can either be a massive hackathon or a small workshop.3. GitHub ProGitHub Pro would allow you additional features when using GitHub. These features are tech-y and not what I would like to share here. You can always read about them in their documentation.

"Software Engineering like a 6,000 piece Hogwarts LEGO castle",https://medium.com/@glennstempeck/software-engineering-like-a-6-000-piece-hogwarts-lego-castle-bc7441d0b1b5?source=tag_archive---------4-----------------------,"Software Engineering,Software Development,Software Architecture,Software","This one’s for the engineering leaders looking for an analogy to explain why you’re limited on taking-on “yet another project” or when asked to “multi-task more effectively” without sacrificing quality, speed, or sanity in your engineering organization.Comments, feedback, suggestions for improvement welcome and appreciated! I’ll modify this based on feedback so we can perfect it together for future onlookers.Here we go! Close your eyes and Imagine….You’re attempting to build a 6,000 piece LEGO set. Hogwarts LEGO castle, it’s real!You’ve opted to build with 2 other people and committed to 2 weeks to complete it. You decide who is going to do what portion and what parts you can actually do separately, since some parts can only be completed by a single individual in a specific sequence order. You plan out who is doing what first and determine what will work and won’t as you divide up the work.You get started building, and get a few pages into the instructions when someone comes up and hands you a different 500 piece LEGO structure, which is more important to complete right away. You decide to have two of the three people switch to the 500 piece set and leave 1 moving forward on Hogwarts.The two people will have a little harder time planning how to work together on a 500 piece set because it’s smaller and simpler, but you know it’s a higher priority so you don’t want to leave two thirds of your people on Hogwarts Castle.As you’re moving forward on both of those, someone comes along and hands you a third set, and voices an expectation that you need all 3 done in that same 2 weeks (now already 4 days in).You can see a limit here, if another person arrives and drops a 4th set on you, you can’t reasonably even work on it (you have 3 people), and you also can’t complete all of them in the same 2 weeks either because Hogwarts was 6,000 pieces and the only reason you said it would take 2 weeks in the first place was because you had 3 people working on it originally. To make matters more complicated, the 1 person left on Hogwarts needed to spend time figuring out where the other 2 people left-off and how those pieces are going to fit together, which has gotten a bit more confusing because the plan changed.So you convince the stakeholders this is not going to work out and we need to prioritize and complete one at a time fully. They choose Hogwarts after all. Now imagine the 2 people that were no longer involved in Hogwarts coming back to work on it again after that first person was left to make progress for several days. It’s now in some unknown state to them and they need to re-plan what parts they can work on, re-coordinate who is going to build what and how they’re going to connect their parts back together when they get to that point. Any other disruptions to that plan will repeat the cycle over again, each time slowing it down and introducing the possibility of mistakes that end up leaving it in a poor state that doesn’t fit together well and doesn’t look like the instructions originally intended without tearing it down and starting all over.Building Software is like a multi-thousand (sometimes million) pieces LEGO set if we consider each line of code a block in the solution. We can break the work up, and we can even have multiple sets (pieces of software) that all comprise our LEGO-city, but we need to complete each of the sets before jumping into the next or we’ll have a giant mess on the floor and pieces that start to get mixed up and turn into a bigger mess.Always prioritize and relentlessly focus on producing quality sets, whether it’s LEGOs or Software you’re trying to build!Written byGlenn StempeckFollowSoftware EngineeringSoftware DevelopmentSoftware ArchitectureSoftwareMore from Glenn StempeckFollowMore From MediumOptimized Image Loading in HTML and MarkdownNikita Goncharuk in The StartupHow to Fan-Out to Different SQS Queues Using SNS Message FilteringLorenz Vanthillo in Better ProgrammingWhat the heck is an API?

Errors Are There to Help You,https://medium.com/swlh/errors-are-there-to-help-you-e029ad751f84?source=tag_archive---------5-----------------------,"Software,Error Message","Photo by visuals on Unsplash. (Source)A few months ago I was helping a student with CSS animations, and we were pairing remotely on an online code editor. We set up our keyframes, defined our animation duration, created our div, hit save, and…nothing moved. We couldn’t figure out why. We tried tinkering with the CSS, changing the animation properties, refreshing, simplifying the keyframes. No luck.At the end of class we found this block of CSS at the bottom of our file:body {   background: url("");}We had inadvertently written this at the beginning of the pairing session and had forgotten about it.Recognizing our silly mistake, I thought to myself, why didn’t the editor tell us about this?Whatever HTML or CSS you give to a web browser, it won’t complain: it will try its best to render something reasonable on the screen. In our case, neither the online code editor nor the browser alerted us that there was something wrong. If it had thrown an error, we would’ve been spared a lot of frustration.This made me think about how errors in software are like pain signals in the physical world—they are built in to help you navigate and survive. Pain is unpleasant, but it’s a useful mechanism that helps you avoid significant damage to your body. At first glance, it may seem beneficial to be completely incapable of feeling pain, but this condition can cause all sorts of problems.In software, an error is there so that you as the developer can solve the problem before it gets into production and propagates to your end user, at which point a mistake is far more consequential.But as novice developers, we often think of errors as bad—indications that we’ve done something wrong and are being punished for it. This association is exacerbated by the fact that errors are written in jarring red text or all caps, giving them an especially reproachful sting. The only reason they’re expressed this way is to get our attention. Errors need to stand out, and what better way to stand out than by giving the developer a subtle jolt of anxiety.In fact, we don’t just want error messages to stand out, we want them to give us a clear idea of what we did wrong. A great programming language or framework will give you precise errors that help you fix your problem quickly. So rather thanSegfault: you broke something and I have no idea whyYou want to get something closer toTypeError: you can't access a 'radius' property on type SquareSo errors are built with the developer in mind, and if designed well, they can be very helpful.We can use this to do some cognitive reappraisal. We need not view errors as malevolent entities out to hurt our feelings and derail our careers. You can view the next error you encounter as a source of wisdom. That TypeError that’s showing up for the 12th time has your best interests at heart — it derives joy and a sense of purpose from preemptively surfacing bugs and giving your users a better experience.So the next time you see an error, don’t be upset. Say to the error: Thank you error, for guiding me to the right path.The StartupMedium's largest active publication, followed by +723K people.

You can now download your virtual tour with TourMkr,https://medium.com/@eve_012_ts/you-can-now-download-your-virtual-tour-with-tourmkr-d5d4cbb1b372?source=tag_archive---------6-----------------------,"Virtual Tour,360 Video,Tour,Software,Web Hosting","The virtual tour software industry is always growing, opening up new possibilities for operators in the real estate market, tourism, and education, amongst others. But creating a virtual tour is often very challenging and needs certain expertise. This is why the adoption of creating virtual tours is still not widespread, even though its advantages are extremely important and well-established by many who are investing in this technology. Would it be helpful if platforms could provide a download virtual tour functionality?Challenges of Virtual ToursAlthough creating a virtual tour can be really helpful in promoting your product, it also comes along with 2 major challenges:• Takes too much timeBuilding your virtual tour requires a lot of time investment. This is certainly not an easy task and even professionals need to spend many hours in front of the software to create a good result.It’s costlyThese are the main reasons why many operators do not create virtual tours for all their services, but only for those that perform best. But what if you knew that your created outcome could be downloaded for you to manage and distribute?Virtual Tour Download functionalityEvery virtual tour creator allows you to host your end-product to their own web hosting software. However, this limits your options when it comes to distributing your tour and being in charge of its performance. And up to this point, there was nothing else available in the market that could provide users the freedom of downloading their virtual tours.TourMkr is bringing this option to its users.

Golden hand handcuffs in software engineering,https://medium.com/@daviddelapuentesalmon_46455/golden-hand-handcuffs-in-software-engineering-ceb1a4448474?source=tag_archive---------7-----------------------,"Software Engineering,Software","What I'm about to tell you is something very interesting that happens in the software engineering world (actually it happens in a lot of industries, but i want to focus in software). What is a golden handcuff? well, is a metaphor for a situation where you are tied up (handcuffed) to an industry, a job, a company, etc. Due to monetary insentient (gold) like salary, bonuses, healthcare, etc. OK, but this is good, right? I mean is good that big companies pay a lot of money to their employees, but i think this phenomenon becomes more interesting when you see it through a business model view, or through the business strategy companies takes against their adversaries.Take a moment to think how important are software engineers in the IT age (I will help you with some related words: connection, speed, big data, internet, AI, streaming, security, integration, bitcoins, transaction,etc). We are so important that companies see us like a “must have” resource, but not only that, they know our potential and that’s why they invest money in us (trainings in general).So the thing is, companies put golden handcuffs on software engineers because they don't want to loose good employees. is part of their business model, they need to keep us working for them, they need us not working for the competition, and they don't want to loose the money invested in our training. We add a lot of value for a company, we are a very important resource (I don't have problem to see my self as a resource) and we are a very important gear in the business model.Now that you know the value of software engineers (if you are a software engineer, congratulation, you are very important, and please believe it, you are worth a lot) is time to reveal the bad thing. The problem about golden handcuff is the opportunity cost. Clément Mihailescu, tell us in his video “The 5 Worst Things About Working at Google”. that when you work on a big company, probably you would not have time to work on your own entrepreneurship. And this is a bad thing if you want to make your own IT business or be an entrepreneur.To finish i just want to say that the goal of this post, is to show the readers the importance of software engineers, and if you are a software engineer, give you an idea of what is a golden handcuff.Written byDavid De La Puente SalmonFollowSoftware EngineeringSoftwareMore from David De La Puente SalmonFollowMore From MediumFacebook Posting Using Selenium and C# (.NET Core)Oded Olive in The StartupBuilding a Browser Push Notification Service — Long Polling and the Web Socket protocolSinghania Aditya in The StartupSpring: Advanced search & filteringMilan BrankovicLearning To Use Rust Over a 16-Hour HackathonSid Shankar in Better ProgrammingInterview Questions: Write Yahtzee in PythonMartin Andersson Aaberge in Better ProgrammingPractical Automation: Deleting 15,000+ Pocket Entries by Tag with PythonBraden Wong in Optim10 Reasons to Prefer Native Tooling to SubprocessesJacob Unna in FullStackAIJava Concurrency: The BasicsTiago Albuquerque in The StartupAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

Where will tech go from here?,https://medium.com/@franciscoperez_48951/where-will-tech-go-from-here-38ed394fd07e?source=tag_archive---------9-----------------------,"Strategy,Data Science,Hardware,User Experience,Software","Where tech was yesterday and what it should look for tomorrow.This week I felt connected and identified with an article by Pete Pizarro, Managing Director of Salt Venture Partners, titled “Construyamos tecnología accesible” (Let’s build accessible technology).In particular, there are two points I have also discussed it with my peers in the industry.The paradigm shift happening in tech — from Hardware dependent solutions to Software. This is a problem that caught of guard some of the traditional hardware companies and some of them are still struggling to adapt and compete with more agile, bottom-up, less structure players. But more importantly, these companies are willing to sacrifice short term gains with long term vision.Photo by Michael Van Kerckhove on UnsplashClosing the communication gap between the product people and users. Companies should start building products not only for the IT savvy people but for everyone.Photo by Ryoji Iwata on UnsplashHere’s the translation in English of my comment:Excellent point! This is one of the areas I’m passionate about today. Me and my team with try to ask ourselves the following question: How can we create products that are relevant to our customers?. In my experience this goes beyond appealing to behavior, we must also consider feelings and reactions to the problems we are solving. However, there are still three factors that tech companies must take into account:a) Cognitive diversity within the product group. Taking the example of Latin America, we ask ourselves the question of, whether or not we have the ideal staff to make decisions relevant to each region?.b) Identify and recognize the prejudices that exist in product teams. What is the problem we understand and what is the reality?. In theory, this sounds easy, but in practice it requires constant reflection when considering the product strategy.c) Finally. Clearly we are in an era where, most often, we are basing our product decisions on evidence and data, rather than instinct or experience. This area is particularly interesting, as access to this big-data and analytics technology is easily accessible through any cloud provider today.In the end, the question remains, outside of technology leaders, how will the rest of the technology sector react to these changes?To answer this question, we will need to keep an eye, who will be able to adapt the fastest, who will be the next disruptors and who will probably fail in this transition.Written byFrancisco PerezDad | Mountain Biker | Product Guy — trying to become better today than how I was yesterday.FollowStrategyData ScienceHardwareUser ExperienceSoftwareMore from Francisco PerezFollowDad | Mountain Biker | Product Guy — trying to become better today than how I was yesterday.More From MediumBalancing the hypothetical with the actualNicole Manning in The StartupA Strategy MapRoman PichlerHow To Build a Healthy Product Roadmap: Foundational PrinciplesLuke Gallimore in Nodes DigitalHow to improve the success rate of software projects with premortemsMike PilawskiFive Steps: Getting a Product Analytics PlatformJoriz De Guzman in The Startup6 diagrams I use to explain Product Management conceptsCurtis Stanier in The Startup3 lessons learnt as a first-time Product Manager at ShopeeCadence Cheng in The StartupWhich skills do you need to succeed as a Product Owner?David Pereira in Serious ScrumAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Software Engineering — Introduction : 01,https://medium.com/@effectivereader/software-engineering-introduction-01-489334305585?source=tag_archive---------10-----------------------,"Software Development,Software Engineering,Software,Computer Science,Information Technology","Software Engineering — Introduction : 01Introduction -In this series of lectures we will be looking at the subject software engineering. And for today’s session I will be discussing majorly on introduction to software engineering. Before we start with the introduction of software engineering I would like to mention the statistics behind how this software would perform given a scenario. As per the IBM’s report 31% of the projects gets cancelled before they are completed. 53% overrun by their cost estimates by an average of 189% and for every 100 projects there are 94 restarts. So this is the pie chart relating to what I have said. If you look at this pie chart the failure rate of every software that is being developed is 31% the success rate counts only to be 16%. Whereas the overall budget relating to the software it overruns by a cost of 189% as I have said. That comes around 53%. Some of the questions that tickles your mind before we go on this particular topic of software engineering. Question 1 why does it so long to get the program finished? Why are costs for building this software so high? Why cannot we find all errors before the release? Why do we have difficulty in measuring the progress of software development? So these are some of the questions that tickles every brain during the process of development of a software. At the same time we have certain crisis factor which is around this software which are the problem of developing the software might be larger, lack of adequate training relating to the corresponding software that we develop and increase in skill shortage, low productivity improvements. So to come out with the solution for all these kind of problems we may have to initially define what exactly is a software? Then we will slowly progress towards how the skills related to software engineering could be progressed. First I will define what exactly software is. Software is nothing but an instruction that when executed provide desired functions, features and performance. Or otherwise it can even be defined as a data structure that enable the programs to adequately manipulate information. The third piece of definition of a software would be a descriptive information in both hard copy and virtual forms that describes the operation and use of programs. Proprietary software also exist. So when you look at these three definitions it says software could either be in a form of a set of instructions, or it can be defined in terms of an algorithm, to manipulate a large amount of information or it can even be a descriptive information in terms of a hard copy or a virtual form. To be very specific of software can be said as a collection of programs, along with its operating procedures and its documentation. By now everybody would be clear on what exactly would be a program and new we have to see what are the operating procedures behind all these programs and why is this documentation to important for the entire piece of software. First of all I will let you know the importance of documentation manuals, as such when we wanted to develop a software or exactly I mention is a small piece of code to be done we don’t start writing the appropriate code immediately. Say if I want you to write a program to find a number between 0,100 it is very simple for us to write a program to find whether it is between 0 , 100. At the same time, once it is said to be like a development a complete of a software development this is a small program that may take maximum of 5 lines for it to done. But once the same volume of program to be converted into a software requires a lot of analysis. So we will understand what I have said in the initial problem. write a program to find whether the given number is between 0, 100 in such a case we may have to understand what does the word ‘between’ means, whether it should start with 0 or it should start with 1 whether it should end with 99 or 100 so that is the kind of understanding every programmer might need at the initial. So how to write 5 lines of a program it requires a large amount of analysis. So as part this analysis we will try to initially define the between and we find out any number from 1 to 99 will be an appropriate solution to the given problem. So appropriate documentation manual which communicates between the user and the customer or the developer is required so that we can avoid the miscommunication. So documentation manuals are pretty much during the phase of development of the entire software. So as part of documentation manuals what are important is we say one component as analysis and specification the other component as design the third component would be implementation and the fourth one would be testing. So whenever we wanted the software to be developed if it is to be properly engineered then it should follow the same sequence of analysis design implementation and testing. It need not be software alone it can be to any piece of engineering if it goes through the same phase of A D I and T analysis design implementation and testing it will be purely engineered. But for software we may say this implementation as coding also. So as a part of documentation manual what I would require for an analysis and specification document would be a formal specification which says what are the hardware components to be used what is the object is which I am supposed to start the software development and what are the outcomes with these list of specifications which are said to be the formal specifications I will start with the development of software with which I will start drawing a context diagram this context diagram is specific to the domain with which I am trying to develop this software and then the flow the complete follow relating to this particular will be mentioned in the dataflow diagram. So this formal specification will be later named as software requirements specification document which we will call it as SRS in abbreviation. so formal specification is a complete list of documents which completely understands what exactly is the need of this particular software. As a second level with the design engineers these are two fundamental things that we may have to do with the software development either we may have to draw a flowchart or an ER diagram in case of database tables. And the third one being the implementation which has source code and cross reference listing. Source code as you know every program requires a statement to be executed and a cross-reference may be in terms of library or a dll file. And last component which is quite important during the phase of software development which is testing the given data and testing how the result is being declared so testing results. So now I have mentioned you about the importance of documentation manuals towards the development of the software. As another component towards software development we will understand what this operating procedure would be. As part of operating procedures we basically might need two things one is called user manual and the other one would be an operational manual. As part of user manual the user initially tries to understand the overall view of the system and he should in turn have a beginner’s guide tutorial and a reference help. And as part of operational manual a complete installation guide and a system administration guide is also being important. So when a software is being developed user have one perspective of working on the software and the administrators have another perspective of working on the same software. So everybody requires a complete documentation of how they are supposed to operate in case of heavy risks. After having understood what exactly is a software which is a combination of program operating procedure and documentation now that I’ll let you know what are the various domains in which these software applications would work. The first one is supposed to be a system software which is supposed to be a collection of programs written to service other programs maybe one can develop a compiler and editor which are supposed to be called a part of system software development. Second one is an application software which is supposed to be said a standalone program that solve specific business needs. Any specific requirement given by the customer if it is focused towards those specific requirements this kind of software is called application software. The third one would be an engineering software where exactly initially I have started with a data structure defined with a set of instructions likewise this engineering software has been characterized by a number of crunching algorithms. the fourth one being the embedded software which resides within a product, say a lift to be get operated it has a small chip embedded with a list of programs so that is called an embedded software washing machine which is programmed already and is being run which is again supposed to be a program with a software operating on the backside. so embedded software resides within a product or a system and it is used to implement and control features. Fifth one being product line software which is designed to provide specific capability for use by many different users and web applications which is the evolving computing environment for today that not only provide features functions and the content which software is supposed to have, but also integrate with corporate databases and business applications. so software are generally made into products and may be developed for a particular customer or may be developed for a general market. Today everywhere we go we see online market existing or they have a software inbuilt by where the list all the products with their quantity item and so, if it is a super market and looking at the software products there either can be generic of it can be custom made. The custom made we also call it as bespoke model if it is generic it is developed to be sold for different range of customers. It is as I told you before if it is an application software designed to meet of specific customers but then the same software can be made generic and multiple people can use the same software and custom made is developed for a single customer according to their specification. So by here we will understand what exactly software would mean now we will start saying merging engineering with the software. software engineering is an engineering discipline which is concerned with all the aspects of software production so every software engineer should possess basic qualities so it has to adopt a systematic and organized procedure to their work use appropriate tools and technique depending on what is the problem to be solved and what are the different development constraints and use the resources that are available for the development of this software which we call it as an infrastructure development. So now we will define what exactly this software engineering would mean. The first set of statements which I have given was for software now that we wanted to plan and organize in a systematic way to develop the same kind of the software. Here comes two different definitions relating to software engineering. First definition according to Fritz Bauer the establishment and the use of sound engineering principles in order to obtain economically developed software that is reliable and works efficiently on real machines. The importance in this particular definition is on three key terms one is on engineering principles which I have said planned and organized way of executing all the programs the second one we wanted to develop a software which is completely economical and third one is on the reliability aspect of it. whereas the second definition which is slightly detailed which says a discipline whose aim is production of quality software that is delivered on time within budget and satisfies all the requirement of the user and this definition is being given by Stephen Schach. If you look at this particular definition the stress in given more towards the outcome of the software that we developed he stress on the software that got developed need to be of utmost quality it should be within the budget and should be developed on time meaning that I have specified this as a duration for the completion of the project within the same duration I am supposed to complete so these all we have seen in the first component as a drawbacks that we have seen with the software more than 53% of the software failed because of these reason and some percentage of software which overrun their cost estimates was we have to keep in mind that these are the four list of constraint which are the major outcomes relating to the project I repeat it is a quality software that is delivered in time with in the budget and it should meet all the requirements given by the customers for this software to get it be developed we require a list of processes. So the software processes is the way in which we produce software when we look at why is it difficult to improve the software process it is majorly because of not enough time and the lack of knowledge. At to look at specifically the characteristics of the software is not being manufactured and software does not wear our as it is with the hardware. to list out more characteristics of this software reusability of components when I mean reusability the software once developed can be reused for a particular piece of code example of such software would be initial level I will use the same username and password and captcha which is existing in one form to multiple software being developed and software is flexible enough to adopt to changes now we will look what is the changing nature of the software a trend has emerged to provide the source code to the customer and to the organizations, so pervious days when we wanted to develop the software people we very specific that the source code of the entire software will not be deliberately given now it is a world of open source programming so every person can look at the source code of the perform also so trend has emerged again to provide the source code both to the customer and to the organization and software where source codes are available are known as open source software some of the myths that we have relating the software includes management may be confident about good standards and clear procedures of the component but the taste of any food item is in the eating and not in the recipe. the second myth about the neither software is company has latest computers and state of art software tools so we shouldn’t worry about the quality of the product, if at all we look only at these two aspects i.e. state of art tools that are available latest computes are available there shouldn’t be any problem major risk involved during the phase of development of the software as I have mentioned you before it may be because of lack of knowledge in appropriate use of tools or appropriate use of the hardware. So the infrastructure us only one of the several factors that determine the quality of the product. The other factors which include the features relating to the product the functions relating to the product use of those standard knowledge and those products those hardware materials available for the development of the software. Addition of more software specialists those with higher skills and longer experience may bring the schedule back on the track. when we say we wanted the time to be limited so I tried to include more manpower towards the development of software and I wanted to include I wanted to bring back the schedule back on the track, this doesn’t mean that I can bring back the entire program or the entire software development well ahead rather it may sometimes even delay the entire process. And software is easy to change the really is totally different as I have told you software is flexible but then it is not that easy for us to understand the complete flow of the program and change. Computers provide greater reliability than the devices they replace this is not always been true. Another software myth would be missing vague requirements can easily be incorporated detailed out as they got concretized. If we do so we are heading towards a disaster. So anything any requirement that has been collected in the initial time as part of analysis and specification documentation anything that is left out in the initial may produce higher quantum of risk in the later stages. So that is what this myth is indicating missing vague requirements can easily be incorporated detailed out as they may get concretized. So this might lead towards higher set of problems when we proceed to the final versions of the program. Software with more features is better software, software can work right the first time. So try to understand these two terminologies in the beginning software which has more features as I have mentioned features functions are certain requirements basic requirements for the development of software that doesn’t completely mean when we provide totally when we add more amount of features that make a better software that is not perfect in the case that when we work on the software the first time it should work perfectly so both are only the myths. Once the software is demonstrated the job is done. So anything that got demonstrated to the customer that doesn’t mean that it is completely done it may undergo several changes in it as an as and when we progress towards it. So at the phase of testing one piece of testing team or a team who develops one particular module of the entire software might show one output as it progresses towards another module then we may have to integrate and show a different version of the entire product. So usually problems being here. That doesn’t mean what I am trying to say is that doesn’t completely mean software once having demonstrated means it is totally complete. Another software myth would be software quality cannot be assessed before testing. However quality assessment techniques should be used throughout the software development lifecycle. here I use a term called software development lifecycle which exactly I have mentioned during the initial slides which said analysis design implementation and testing when we progress towards these four parts in a sequence we mean they entire phase is supposed to be a software development lifecycle. The only deliverable for a software development is the tested code. So as such what I have mentioned with the initial problem is write a program to find whether the given number is between 0,100 when I have given this problem we have to come across a testing standard. For this particular problem you can initially assume that 50 is a quite good number to be given and tested and which might respond with a positive result. But then once if I have not understood or if I have not come across the word ‘between’ then I might land in a problem of giving a zero and finding a positive result and at the same time giving a 100 and finding out the same positive result. But that shouldn’t happen. so I have to check between my customer would be under a purview that any number between 1 and 99 should work fine, 0 and 100 having inserted should not give any positive result. So this will uncovered during the phase of testing. So the only deliverable for the software development project is the tested code. So tested code is only one of the deliverable and it is not the only deliverable that I will try to provide. So the aim is to develop working programs now the objective is to develop good quality maintainable programs and not working programs.Thank you.Written byEffective ReaderOur site you can see all the details about the computer and all the career information and some unknown facts that you never knew.FollowSoftware DevelopmentSoftware EngineeringSoftwareComputer ScienceInformation TechnologyMore from Effective ReaderFollowOur site you can see all the details about the computer and all the career information and some unknown facts that you never knew.More From MediumWriting your own custom functions in PythonThe Future Of Work in Python In Plain EnglishOkHttp or Retrofit for Android?Elye in Mobile App Development PublicationHow Programming Improves YouRyan Nehring in Better ProgrammingR Functions FrameworkGrant Timmerman in Google Cloud - CommunityRailway oriented programming, clojure and exception handling: why and how?Yulia Kleb in AppsFlyerPrime Numbers with Loops in CIkechi Michael in Backticks & TildesBuilding simulations with a Go cellular automata frameworkSau Sheong in The StartupString Data Type in GoUday Hiwarale in RunGoAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
