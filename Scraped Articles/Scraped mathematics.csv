Monte Carlo integration in Python,https://towardsdatascience.com/monte-carlo-integration-in-python-a71a209d277e?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Data Science,Python,Programming,Mathematics,Technology","Image source: Wikipedia(Free) and collage made by the authorDisclaimer: The inspiration for this article stemmed from Georgia Tech’s Online Masters in Analytics (OMSA) program study material. I am proud to pursue this excellent Online MS program. You can also check the details here.What is Monte Carlo integration?Monte Carlo, is in fact, the name of the world-famous casino located in the eponymous district of the city-state (also called a Principality) of Monaco, on the world-famous French Riviera.It turns out that the casino inspired the minds of famous scientists to devise an intriguing mathematical technique for solving complex problems in statistics, numerical computing, system simulation.Image source: WikipediaOne of the first and most famous uses of this technique was during the Manhattan Project when the chain-reaction dynamics in highly enriched uranium presented an unimaginably complex theoretical calculation to the scientists. Even the genius minds like John Von Neumann, Stanislaw Ulam, Nicholas Metropolis could not tackle it in the traditional way. They, therefore, turned to the wonderful world of random numbers and let these probabilistic quantities tame the originally intractable calculations.Trinity test: (Image source: Wikipedia)Amazingly, these random variables could solve the computing problem, which stymied the sure-footed deterministic approach. The elements of uncertainty actually won.Just like uncertainty and randomness rule in the world of Monte Carlo games. That was the inspiration for this particular moniker.Image source: PixabayToday, it is a technique used in a wide swath of fields —risk analysis, financial engineering,supply chain logistics,healthcare research, drug developmentstatistical learning and modeling,computer graphics, image processing, game design,large system simulations,computational physics, astronomy, etc.For all its successes and fame, the basic idea is deceptively simple and easy to demonstrate. We demonstrate it in this article with a simple set of Python code.One of the first and most famous uses of this technique was during the Manhattan ProjectThe ideaA tricky integralWhile the general Monte Carlo simulation technique is much broader in scope, we focus particularly on the Monte Carlo integration technique here.It is nothing but a numerical method for computing complex definite integrals, which lack closed-form analytical solutions.Say, we want to calculate,It’s not easy or downright impossible to get a closed-form solution for this integral in the indefinite form. But numerical approximation can always give us the definite integral as a sum.Here is the plot of the function.The Riemann sumThere are many such techniques under the general category of Riemann sum. The idea is just to divide the area under the curve into small rectangular or trapezoidal pieces, approximate them by the simple geometrical calculations, and sum those components up.For a simple illustration, I show such a scheme with only 5 equispaced intervals.For the programmer friends, in fact, there is a ready-made function in the Scipy package which can do this computation fast and accurately.What if I go random?What if I told you that I do not need to pick the intervals so uniformly, and, in fact, I can go completely probabilistic, and pick 100% random intervals to compute the same integral?Crazy talk? My choice of samples could look like this…Or, this…We don’t have the time or scope to prove the theory behind it, but it can be shown that with a reasonably high number of random sampling, we can, in fact, compute the integral with sufficiently high accuracy!We just choose random numbers (between the limits), evaluate the function at those points, add them up, and scale it by a known factor. We are done.OK. What are we waiting for? Let’s demonstrate this claim with some simple Python code.For all its successes and fame, the basic idea is deceptively simple and easy to demonstrate.The Python codeReplace complex math by simple averagingIf we are trying to calculate an integral — any integral — of the form below,we just replace the ‘estimate’ of the integral by the following average,where the U’s represent uniform random numbers between 0 and 1. Note, how we replace the complex integration process by simply adding up a bunch of numbers and taking their average!In any modern computing system, programming language, or even commercial software packages like Excel, you have access to this uniform random number generator. Check out my article on this topic,How to generate random variables from scratch (no library used)We go through a simple pseudo-random generator algorithm and show how to use that for generating important random…towardsdatascience.comWe just choose random numbers (between the limits), evaluate the function at those points, add them up, and scale it by a known factor. We are done.The functionHere is a Python function, which accepts another function as the first argument, two limits of integration, and an optional integer to compute the definite integral represented by the argument function.The code may look slightly different than the equation above (or another version that you might have seen in a textbook). That is because I am making the computation more accurate by distributing random samples over 10 intervals.For our specific example, the argument function looks like,And we can compute the integral by simply passing this to the monte_carlo_uniform() function,Here, as you can see, we have taken 100 random samples between the integration limits a = 0 and b = 4.How good is the calculation anyway?This integral cannot be calculated analytically. So, we need to benchmark the accuracy of the Monte Carlo method against another numerical integration technique anyway. We chose the Scipy integrate.quad()function for that.Now, you may also be thinking — what happens to the accuracy as the sampling density changes. This choice clearly impacts the computation speed — we need to add less number of quantities if we choose a reduced sampling density.Therefore, we simulated the same integral for a range of sampling density and plotted the result on top of the gold standard — the Scipy function represented as the horizontal line in the plot below,Therefore, we observe some small perturbations in the low sample density phase, but they smooth out nicely as the sample density increases. In any case, the absolute error is extremely small compared to the value returned by the Scipy function — on the order of 0.02%.The Monte Carlo trick works fantastically!Image source: PixabayWhat about the speed?But is it as fast as the Scipy method? Better? Worse?We try to find out by running 100 loops of 100 runs (10,000 runs in total) and obtaining the summary statistics.In this particular example, the Monte Carlo calculations are running twice as fast as the Scipy integration method!While this kind of speed advantage depends on many factors, we can be assured that the Monte Carlo technique is not a slouch when it comes to the matter of computation efficiency.we observe some small perturbations in the low sample density phase, but they smooth out nicely as the sample density increasesRinse, repeat, rinse, and repeat…For a probabilistic technique like Monte Carlo integration, it goes without saying that mathematicians and scientists almost never stop at just one run but repeat the calculations for a number of times and take the average.Here is a distribution plot from a 10,000 run experiment.As you can see, the plot almost resembles a Gaussian Normal distribution and this fact can be utilized to not only get the average value but also construct confidence intervals around that result.Confidence IntervalsAn interval of 4 plus or minus 2 A Confidence Interval is a range of values we are fairly sure our true value lies in…www.mathsisfun.comParticularly suitable for high-dimensional integralsAlthough for our simple illustration (and for pedagogical purpose), we stick to a single-variable integral, the same idea can easily be extended to high-dimensional integrals with multiple variables.And it is in this higher dimension that the Monte Carlo method particularly shines as compared to Riemann sum based approaches. The sample density can be optimized in a much more favorable manner for the Monte Carlo method to make it much faster without compromising the accuracy.In mathematical terms, the convergence rate of the method is independent of the number of dimensions. In machine learning speak, the Monte Carlo method is the best friend you have to beat the curse of dimensionality when it comes to complex integral calculations.Read this article for a great introduction,Monte Carlo Methods in Practice (Monte Carlo Integration)Monte Carlo Methods in Practice If you understand and know about the most important concepts of probability and…www.scratchapixel.comAnd it is in this higher dimension that the Monte Carlo method particularly shines as compared to Riemann sum based approaches.SummaryWe introduced the concept of Monte Carlo integration and illustrated how it differs from the conventional numerical integration methods. We also showed a simple set of Python codes to evaluate a one-dimensional function and assess the accuracy and speed of the techniques.The broader class of Monte Carlo simulation techniques is more exciting and is used in a ubiquitous manner in fields related to artificial intelligence, data science, and statistical modeling.For example, the famous Alpha Go program from DeepMind used a Monte Carlo search technique to be computationally efficient in the high-dimensional space of the game Go. Numerous such examples can be found in practice.Introduction to Monte Carlo Tree Search: The Game-Changing Algorithm behind DeepMind's AlphaGoA best-of five-game series, $1 million dollars in prize money - A high stakes shootout.

Moving from academia to industry — a mathematician’s tale,https://medium.com/@rami.luisto/moving-from-academia-to-industry-a-mathematicians-tale-d8dfda40604f?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Mathematics,Academia,Private Sector,Career Advice","How the transition from acadmy to industry looks like. Combined from Unsplash images. (This one and this one.) Here and in what follows the term ‘industry’ simply refers to any non-academical company or position.After spending almost fifteen years of my life in various universities, going from a freshman student to a postdoctoral researcher in mathematics, I finally decided to take a big leap and move from the academical world to the private sector. The process of the transition was not completely simple, so I thought that it would be useful for me to write down some of my experiences. In particular, I aim to tell here the kinds of things that I would have liked to have known beforehand. In this text I’ll first say a few words of my professional background and then describe the transition process from preparation to finish.Caveat lector: this is a description of a specific journey from the academical world to the private sector by this specific mathematician, not a step-by-step guide. In particular, when I was born I hit the birth lottery jackpot and I am in the top 1% of pretty much any unfair privilege group, YMMV.Personal BackgroundI started my math studies at the University of Helsinki in 2006, and roughly ten years later I got my PhD in mathematics from the very same institution. Despite studying a small amount of computer science, university pedagogy and physics, by my estimate I finished as a ’95% pure mathematician’. By this I mean that even though I’ve always been interested in things beyond just mathematics, my research profile and thus majority of my work was completely focused in math for the sake of math in a field with few immediate applications to the real world.After getting my PhD I spent four-ish years doing various postdocs at UCLA (3 months), University of Jyväskylä (6 months), the Charles University in Prague (1 year) and again at University of Jyväskylä (2 years). Getting the chance to work in so many different research environments was a huge plus and it considerably expanded both my research profile and my social networks, but it also had the downside of having to move around a lot during these years. The constant instability and uncertainty about future workplaces can be, and was for me, very grating. In the end the yearning for stability was one of the larger motivations for the transition, together with the ever increasing need to actually live in the same city as my wife, family and friends. Travel is much more fun when it’s the exception and not the rule.During my graduate studies and my postdoc periods my work concentrated on research and teaching, but one of my primus motors in life is learning new (technical) things and I’ve pretty much always had the hobby of ‘studying various topics’. Usually these hobbies are short-lived, spending few months studying something new, but they do build up during the years. In particular, I’ve had an on-again, off-again type of relationship with programming since I was 16. I wouldn’t go as far as saying that I’m was good programmer when the process started a year ago, but I was an adequate script-writer in a few different languages.Motivations for the changeBesides the ‘negative pressure’ from instability of the academical work life and the frustrations from the cumbersome application rounds, there were also several positive motivations to seek new professional vistas.A particularly large influence on the decision to transition was hearing experiences of other people moving to the private sector. Especially in hindsight I get the feeling that mathematicians in the academical career path have a skewed view of the employment possibilities outside of the math department. I don’t think that it is intentional propaganda, but I believe that identifiable role models have a huge effect on what kind of life and career people pursue, and the role models available at math departments tend to be very biased. From the university research and teaching personnel with permanent positions that I personally know, I’d say one in a hundred have had significant work experience in the private sector after getting their PhD. The rest have, as far as I know, followed the unwavering path of academy positions until tenure. There is nothing bad in this career progression, but it would be healthy to be more aware of the alternatives. And yes, there are of course career events and colloquia where we get to hear from the other possibilities, but those don’t have nearly the same impact as spending countless hours in a community where 99% of the people you look up to have gone through the same path. I do not know how math-specific this bias is and it is probably related to the fact that research in pure mathematics is done only in universities — it would be interesting to plot the percentage of e.g. tenured professors in various department who have worked for at least 12 months in the private sector after receiving their PhD, but the data would take some time to come by.The important lesson here for me was to find out that there is big world of interesting and challenging work opportunities outside the walls of the math department. Indeed, besides the second hand stories, I had the chance to do some professional consulting related to AI and mathematics and thus practice a bit what it is like in the industry. I was very pleasantly surprised to find complicated and interesting problems that required methods from my mental research toolbox to solve. The aims and goals can be, of course, a little less fanciful than ‘exquisite mathematical beauty’ and more in the vein of ‘the board requires a 5% performance increase this quarter’, but this doesn’t mean that the work isn’t fascinating. Furthermore, having quantifiable achievable goals can do wonders for your mental well-being. In particular, in my research I very rarely if ever feel that I’ve exceeded the expectations of others or of myself — the proof could always have been prettier or I could have found the correct lemma sooner — whereas producing a 18% speed increase in this quarter will get you appraisal and pats on the back, maybe even a bonus!Within the private sector, I also feel that I can do more direct Good than in the research environment. This is not to say that research does not do Good — I strongly believe that fundamental research, knowledge for the sake of knowledge, is not only important but even crucial for humanity at large. However, the benefit of research in pure mathematics to the general human condition can be quite a few steps detached from the day-to-day life of a mathematician. And even though I believe the work to be useful it does not mean that I feel it in my heart of hearts on a daily basis. Working as a technical consultant isn’t quite the same as healing the sick, but at least you can imagine a chain of effects leading from your work to concretely helping the society.For me, it has been eye-opening to see the different types of job opportunities the private sector has to offer for someone coming from the pure math research environment. And though you do sacrifice some freedoms the benefits can be very much worth it. This does not mean that the choice is easy or fast to make. For me the decision was both difficult and stressful. Especially since for pure mathematics it is exceedingly hard to apply for research positions if you spend a few years not publishing research articles in your field. For me the many long discussions with my wife about the topic were completely invaluable.Addendum: This section has focused on the influences that were moving me to the private sector. This focus has the unfortunate effect of underrepresenting the various motivations I had to not leave the academia, and there are many of those. I won’t start listing all the best things in the academical world in here, but it simply can’t go unsaid that the biggest reason to hesitate leaving the academia was the people. Mathematics is absolute and without adjectives, but the mathematicians are anything but. The communities they form and which I’ve have had the privilege of being part of have given me experiences, friends and memories that I’ll treasure forever.The transitionEven though the timeline of the situation was not quite that clear cut, for the sake of clarity of the exposition we’ll look at the progress in three steps: Preparation, Application submissions and Interviews.PreparationThe idea of working in the private sector had been rolling in my mind every now and then, but I seriously started to consider it in May 2019. (Incidentally, the results and feedback of the Finnish Academy grant application rounds in math are usually announced around May.) I decided to steer my work and hobbies to a direction that would be more applicable not only to my current research and teaching but also to possible future non-academical jobs. I was still planning to possibly stay in academia, but I started hedging my bets.The first thing to do was trying to figure out what kind of jobs I could be interested in and what was available. To this end LinkedIn and some other local job-seeking sites proved to be very helpful, along with friends who were already working in the industry. In the end it turned out that jobs related to AI, cybersecurity or scientific programming were those to most arouse my interested and the common denominator in all these positions was programming. Thus the next step was to enhance the skills to an more employable level.Though I didn’t need to learn to code from scratch, it didn’t mean that I could turn into a proficient programmer overnight, so the plan was to figure out ways to include some programming as a part of my daily routines and maybe start a few hobby projects as well. After some discussions with people already in the private sector, I also set up a proper GitHub account and uploaded any reasonable coding projects I had had in the past. Think of GitHub as an extension of your CV and remember that, if you are like me and don’t have a lot of things to showcase, it is better to be able to signal both interest and that you are able to design and implement algorithms in readable commented code than to have nothing to show. Depending on your level of coding skills, I would also recommend looking at various online courses available. There is a large variation in their price, quality and value, but for example the deep learning specialization course by Andrew Ng at Coursera was great for me both in refreshing my Python skills and in solidifying my scattered knowledge concerning neural networks in practice.Having even a minimal presence at job sites can be very fruitful since, as it turns out, there are people out there looking for math PhDs who know how to program. I had thought that it would take me a long time to make myself hireable and that I would need to have credentials X, Y and Z before starting to seriously apply for positions. In removing this misunderstanding I was helped along by a headhunter who cold-called me in December to ask if I have been planning to work at the private sector. It turns out that there is demand in the industry for people who have a PhD and know how to write code. In the end it got the feeling that many companies seemed to be more interested with the fact that I’m the kind of person who will learn to be better at given tasks than with the particular technical skills I currently possess.Application submissionsMy original plan had been to wait until around June to start applying for positions with my certification-boosted CV, but this changed with the call from the aforementioned headhunter. In my limited experience, headhunters tend to be kinda hype-y about your hireability and skills, but the pep-talks I got from them were really useful for me and I decided to give a go at applying for a position in a company that we will call Company D. Unrelated to this, on the same week a colleague sent me an email about an interesting math consulting position they had noticed, and motivated by the push from the headhunter I decided to give it a go and apply for this Company S as well. The key point I got from the headhunter and what you should remember is that your skills as a PhD are valuable and there are companies who would be eager to have you.To apply, you then of course need a CV. Most people know that you should adjust your CV for each position you are applying for, but even further I highly recommend to also create a new CV from scratch if you haven’t applied to private sector before. This is due to the fact that most academical CVs I’ve seen, at least for mathematicians, tend to be several pages long and contain a lot of specifics. (See below.)For comparison, here are side by side page 2/4 of my ‘academical CV’ (https://luisto.fi/documents/CV-Luisto.pdf) and my one-page ‘industry CV’ (https://luisto.fi/documents/CV-Luisto-OnePage.pdf).The kind of detailed information in an academical CV is often relevant when applying for academical positions where the panel might want to check for specific experiences or merits, but usually a complete overkill for a more normal recruitment process. Google around for examples of modern CVs and read a few blog-posts on LinkedIn on what the people who read the CVs have to say about the topic. Make it easy for the reader to quickly see why they should be interested in you and ask you for an interview.One very important piece of advice from the headhunter was, that companies can be very interested in your communication skills. (This might be particularly true for people with science PhDs as there are some not completely inaccurate stereotypes about our communication abilities.) In this it can be very useful to highlight your teaching experience, public outreach activities and any presentations you have given. You don’t need to be a superb orator, but it is good to signal that you can discuss complicated topics with people who are not in your own small research group bubble. Most of the jobs require you working as a part of a team, and teams tend to work bad if the information is not flowing. Communication skills can and should be signaled in your CV, but bear in mind that this is something that the recruiters will be assessing also in the interviews.I’ll go into more detail about the interview process in the next section, but the end result here was that I wasn’t hired by either of the two companies D or S. Both companies did say, however, that they would like to contact me in roughly six months in their next hiring round, and claimed that I had apparently been ‘the best of the ones not hired’. At this point I decided to wait until June for most of applications, but to take action if anything particularly interesting came up. Thus I ended up sending an application to the company that ended up hiring me after a good friend mentioned that they are looking for an AI-expert / Data Scientist. Around the same time I was also contacted by Company E who had seen my CV on a job-seeking site and asked me for a few interviews. With Company E I feel that the interviews went well and I probably would have gotten an offer from them had the COVID-19 shutdown not started during the interview process.InterviewsAcademical positions, at least on the postdoc level, very rarely have actual job interviews. Thus, by December 2019 I had had essentially one proper job interview for a university teacher position, but no relevant interview experience for technical roles in the private sector. Even though I am quite extroverted and happy to improvise, I was exceedingly nervous. Here there is another good argument for starting to apply early as you will get experience in being in interviews. I don’t know if I learned to be interviewed better, but at least after the first few times I was a lot less nervous before and during.The diagram below tries to visualize the flow of the interviews for the four companies I ended up applying to. In short; in one company I had only one interview, in the other companies I got to second interview as well and for the company that in the end hired me I had three interviews all together. The interviews varied a lot from company to company, but in those with multiple interviews the first one tended to be a more high-level discussion with some people from HR, and the latter interviews had more people from the actual teams that I would be working with.Because literally everything is better with Sankey diagrams, and because it’s nice to have some colorful pictures every now and then.No two interviews were alike, which is quite natural since no two discussions are alike. Remember; you are at the interview because they are interested. You are a valuable asset and you are there to discuss if you are the best fit for each other. The interview is not an exam but a first date where you are talking about each other’s preferences to see if your skills and interests are a match. Don’t just answer questions, but try to ask questions yourself as well to see if the company and team feel like the right place for you. They are not looking for an automaton who’ll complete tasks but a colleague to work with.In all interviews I was asked to introduce myself and ‘tell about yourself’. In the first interviews I think I was a bit too eager, telling a lot more than needed for the position, in later interviews I decided to give somewhat more broader strokes. Like with the CV, the ‘tell about yourself’ is good to fine-tune to the particular company and position. Even better if you are able to read the room — try to feel what information is interesting to the particular people you are talking with. The same holds true for many other topics that will come up; try to figure out both beforehand and in situ how your skills and experiences could be useful for the particular position.The topic of ‘communicating and working in groups’ also came up in various forms, and here it’s good to remember that they are not asking you to list credentials on how you are good at communicating and working with others, but you need to communicate the information to them. The whole interview is you working together with this group of people, trying to solve to question of how well you would fit together. In one company, part of the process was also giving me a technical AI-paper and asked to give a short presentation about the content to the team I would be working with. This was, naturally, a bit scary but also a big plus as it helped me to imagine what it would be like to work with these people.Naturally, I’ve omitted here many of the standard interviewing advice like ‘dress sharply’ and ‘research the company beforehand’ as I’ve wanted to focus on the things that I feel were specific to me being a math PhD applying for the first time to the private sector. Some of the general advice is obvious, some of it not and I do recommend Google and reading a few blog posts about what interviews are all about.In a nutshell: Knowing at least one programming language is a huge plus, you should flaunt your teaching experiences as communication skills, and understand that you are a valuable asset that many companies are happy to hire.AfterwordA year ago when I was first starting to seriously consider leaving the academia, the idea filled me with varying levels of dread. I had many conflicting fears and worries, many of them revolving around feelings of loss and defeat. Now, a year later, I don’t feel at all like I had given up or lost. There are some wistful feelings, of course, but mostly I feel relief, content and excitement. My exciting job will actually stop in the afternoons, I get to sleep in my own bed next to my wife every night of the week and I don’t have to spend a month every year just to apply for my own job. The decision was hard and stressful and it took me months to process and to come to terms with, but in the end it was worth it. So if you are planning a transition and feel worried: it’s quite normal to be scared, take it easy, talk to your loved ones about it and be assured that it can actually feel pretty awesome on the other side.This text has described the transition phase of moving from academy to the industry. I am planning to write two more longer texts, one in roughly three months from now and another roughly one or two years from know, describing what happens after the transition. At least if there seems to be interest to such texts. And if I remember to.What I personally look forward to in these future texts will be the story of what happens with my relationship to mathematical research. I currently think that there will be little hope for me to continue to produce cutting-edge new math, at least by myself, but I’d be ready to believe that I could be able and willing to make contributions to some collaborative projects where the onus of the work is not on me. Even more than such projects that do aim to produce publishable results, I hope that toying around with a few choice research problems that I haven’t quite cracked yet will remain a part-time hobby. But I guess only time will tell.

Notes on graph theory — Centrality measures,https://towardsdatascience.com/notes-on-graph-theory-centrality-measurements-e37d2e49550a?source=tag_archive---------2-----------------------,"Gnn,Graph,Mathematics","Image by AuthorIntroductionCentrality measures are an important tool to analyze your network, whatever its a national road network and you want to determine major cities or its an electrical web and you want to identify critical nodes that need to be maintained in order to eliminate any future disturbance to your network. All this analysis can be done using some simple topological measures that score nodes by their importance as a part of the big network.Graph-theory: IntroductionFirst, I‘ll try to introduce graphs abstraction by giving its definition and its mathematical representation since we will need it for later.Graphs definitionGraphs are everywhere it’s a well-suited tool to present data where connections and links are important for us to understand it. Like molecules structure that presents a collection of basic atoms which are linked to other, forming complex structure where each atom’s connection in this collection means something’s in terms of the usage or the characteristics of this molecule, in fact, changing one of this connection can give you a totally different molecule.This example will help us understand the basic anatomy of a graph that is generated by a bunch of nodes that are connected by edges. Basic anatomy? Yes, but keep adding these nodes and edges and you can create some complex networks that ever existed. Take the example of Facebook where nodes are users and edges are friendships or follows.An example of a graph with 5 nodes and 5 edges (Image by Author)Graph mathematical presentationAs said, graphs can build up to become a complex structure, take the Facebook social network. Thus, it will be hard to study it just by observing it visually, so for that, we need to build mathematical tools that will help us understand or analyze our graph structure.We start with the graph definition as a mathematical object. A graph is defined by its set of nodes and set of edges so it’s trivial that a graph G will be defined as :The mathematical presentation of a graph (Image by Author)N denotes the set of nodes in our graph and E is the set of edges we also define the norm of our graph as the number of nodesAdjacency matrixAs I said earlier we can’t just use the geometrical shape of graphs to analyze them, but we need some sort of tools that encapsulate the information in our graphs and also easy to do mathematical analysis on it.For this, we define the adjacency matrix as binary 2d array n*n where n denotes the number of nodes. Each value can be either 1 if the two nodes are linked else it will be 0. And as you see in the example the adjacency matrix is symmetric for the undirected graph (a type of graph structures) we will see more about this in the next stories.Adjacency matrix example (Image by Author )Graph-theory: Centrality measurementsNow that we have built the basic notions about graphs, we're ready to discover the centrality measurements by giving their definitions and usage. I'll try also to order them in a way you can see easily when to use each type of those measures.Centrality measures are scalar values given to each node in the graph to quantify its importance based on an assumption.Node degreeDefinitionNode degree is one of the basic centrality measures. It's equal to the number of node neighbors. thus the more neighbors a node have the more it's central and highly connected, thus have an influence on the graph.Node Ni have a node degree of 1 / Node Nj have a node degree of 4 (Image by Author)Node degree is local, not globalAlthough node degree gives us an idea about each node connectivity, its a local measure and doesn't show us the global picture. Let me give you an example :The two nodes have the same degree (Image by Author)As you see the two nodes have the same number of neighbors which means they have the same node degree but look at their neighbors, Node 1 is connected to nodes with a high degree and so if we are choosing based on connectivity we will choose it for sure thus node degree as a measure doesn't take neighbors connectivity in consideration that why we call it a local measure.Eigen centralityDefinitionEigenvector centrality measures a node’s importance while taking into consideration its neighbors, in other words, it measures the node degree but goes a step further by counting how many links its connections (neighbors ) have . it uses the decomposition of the adjacency matrix . and so the Eigen centrality for each node i is the ith entry of the A matrix eigenvector with the biggest eigenvalue.Eigen centrality definition (Image by Author )Hubs biaswe 've seen that Eigen centrality is global since it rewards nodes with high and important connectivity(connection in terms of quantity but also quality ). but imagine adding a new node and connecting it to a hub node. this node will have a low degree but a high Eigen centrality since its neighbor is a hub (high degree node ). To clear this imagine you are new to Facebook and you start following Barack Obama or a popular person, that doesn't mean you are that important inside of the network.Image by AuthorPageRank centralityin order to reduce the danger of fake or biased central nodes. The Google founders Larry Page and Sergei Brin invented a new centrality measure (PageRank ) that flattens/damp the effect of hub connection using a damping factor.Page rank centrality measure uses a damping factor to control neighbors'effect on your node while measuring its importance. (Image by Author )Closeness centralityThis type of centrality measures node efficiency in terms of connection to other nodes. Witch node is more efficient when trying to send signals to other nodes using just fewer links? to understand this better let me give you another example.Imagine we have a road network where cities are your nodes and roads are the edges. you own a clothes business and you want to install a new storage facility to supply your clients in all the cities. Trivially you will choose to place it in a city that is closer to all the other ones, in order to reduce your transportations costs.for this use case, closeness centrality would be a good metric to choose your location since it measures the average path length. thus the higher your closeness centrality value, the more your node is close to other nodes in your network.Closeness centrality formula (Image by Author)Betweenness centralityA close measure to closeness centrality in terms of emphasizing on shortest paths is the betweenness centrality. It measures the percentage of shortest paths where our studied node lies in them. Thus a node with high betweenness centrality may have considerable influence over the information passing between other nodes. and so they represent a critical part of your network since removing them will disrupt links between vertices (nodes ) in your graph.Takeaway pointsAs you've seen centrality measures gives node a scalar score that is easy to interpret and also helps you compare nodes in your networks in term of importance and criticality.Another major point is that every centrality measure got an assumption in the background, for example, closeness and betweenness centrality define importance as node efficiency in the information flow within your graph. Others like Eigen centrality or degree centrality rewards highly connected nodes. So my advice to you will be is to use a centrality measure based on your study case and if you want to take it a step forward you can combine them in one general centrality measure that fits your problem needs.Finally, if your using python, I suggest using the Networkx library where they have implemented these centrality measures, so take some time playing with them. And see you soon with another story on graph theory.Resources :Graph theory lectures by BASIRA LABEigen centraliy and PageRankExalidraw: the tool used for sketchesWritten byAnas AIT AOMARA curious engineering student ,obsessed by learning new stuff everydayFollow152 2 Sign up for The Daily PickBy Towards Data ScienceHands-on real-world examples, research,  tutorials, and cutting-edge techniques delivered Monday to Thursday.

Log transform for positivity.,https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/log-transform-for-positivity-d3e1f183c804?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"Machine Learning,Statistics,Mathematics,Deep Learning,Data Science","Copyright: photo(cc) :: WalterMß Copytight © 2006 WalterMß All Rights Reserved.In Simple terms, log transform squashes or compresses range of large numbers and expands the range of small numbers. So if x is larger, then slower the log(x) increments.Log transform on range(1,1000), on x axis is real value and on y axis is log transformed value.If you closely look at the plot above, which actually talks about log transformation on values ranging from 1 to 1000. As we can see from the plot, log has transformed values from [1,1000] into [0,7] range.Note that how x values from 200 to 1000 get compressed into just ~5 and 7. So the larger the x, slower the log(x) increments.Log is only defined when x>0. Log 0 is undefined. It’s not a real number, let’s say Log (base 10) 0=x, so 10^x=0, if you try to solve this, you will see that no value of x raised to the power of 10 gives you zero. 10⁰ is also 1.Log transform is also known as variance stabilizing transform, which is useful when dealing with heavy tailed distributions. Log transform can make highly skewed distributions less skewed. So log transform reduces or removes skewness in data.Log transform reduces or removes skewness and tries to make our distribution normal.Using Log transform as feature engineering technique:To reduce or remove skewness in our data distribution and make it more normal (A.K.A Gaussian distribution) we can use log transformation on our input features (X).We usually see heavy tailed distributions in real world data where values are right skewed(More larger values in distribution) and left skewed(More smaller values in distribution). Algorithms can be sensitive to such distribution of values and can under perform if the range is not properly normalized.Skewed distributionLog transform distributionIt is common practice to apply a logarithmic transformation on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Log transform reduces the range of values caused by outliers.However it is important to remember that once log transform is done, observing data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as Log transforming the data.Next question is: when we do linear regression and get coefficient for X (Independent variable) how do we interpret log transformed independent variables (X) coefficient (Feature importance).For Independent variable(X) Divide the coefficient by 100. This tells us that a 1% increase in the independent variable increases (or decreases) the dependent variable by (coefficient/100) units.Example: the coefficient is 0.198. 0.198/100 = 0.00198. For every 1% increase in the independent variable, our dependent variable increases by about 0.002.Note: I’m also attaching a link below which dives deep into interpreting log transformed features.Using Log transform on target variable:For example let’s consider a machine learning problem where you want to predict price of a house based on input features like (Area, number of bed rooms,…etc).In this problem if you choose to create a linear regression model to fit prices(y) on X(Area, number of bed rooms….) and gradient descent in optimizing the model, the dataset would have some extreme prices (higher values properties) due to which your gradient descent algorithm would focus more on optimizing higher valued properties(Due to large error) and hence would produce a bad model. So performing a log transform on target variable makes sense when your performing linear regression.More importantly linear regression can predict values that are any real number (Negative values). If your model is far off, it can produce negative values, especially when predicting some of the cheaper houses. Real world values like price, income, stock price are positive so its good to log transform it before using linear regression otherwise the linear regression would predict negative values as predictions which doesn’t make sense.Example: Predicting house pricesIf you look at the above example, if you chose to go with RMSE as the cost function then the model would focus more on high valued properties and would perform bad. If you chose log(Actual)-log(Predicted) value it intuitively works in optimizing the model and thereby produce a good model.Model will be under more pressure on correcting large errors due to High valued properties so using log here makes sense.Converting log predictions back to actual values.Converting to actual predictions using np.exp:But you would need actual predictions not the log of predictions, so you can always convert back to actual predictions using exponential of the value (Log(price)).Log loss to improve modelsLogarithmic loss (related to cross-entropy) measures the performance of a classification model where the prediction input is a probability value between 0 and 1. The goal of our machine learning models is to minimize this value. A perfect model would have a log loss of 0. Log loss increases as the predicted probability diverges from the actual label. So predicting a probability of .012 when the actual observation label is 1 would be bad and result in a high log loss.Log loss in binary classification settingIf you look at the above example when true value is 1 and predicted probability is 0.1, the log loss is high. Whereas when true value is 1 and predicted probability is 0.9, log loss is low.Log transformation in Text Classification (Natural language processing)We use tf-idf method to encode our text data to fit machine learning models. Tf-idf uses log transform on inverse document frequency, so the word that appears in every single document will be effectively zeroed out, and a word that appears in very few documents will have an even larger count than before.TF-IDFPlease share this article if it helped you understand how important log is to machine learning.

Vasya and Socks — Codeforces Solution 460A With Explanation,https://medium.com/@deeptechtalker/vasya-and-socks-codeforces-solution-460a-with-explanation-b4a5aa56c24b?source=tag_archive---------4-----------------------,"Programming,Mathematics,Math,Computer Science,Job Interview","Photo by Vince Jacob on UnsplashProblem StatementVasya has n pairs of socks. In the morning of each day, Vasya has to put on a pair of socks before he goes to school. When he comes home in the evening, Vasya takes off the used socks and throws them away. Every m-th day (at days with numbers m, 2m, 3m, …) mom buys a pair of socks to Vasya. She does it late in the evening, so that Vasya cannot put on a new pair of socks before the next day. How many consecutive days pass until Vasya runs out of socks?Solution ExplanationWe first see that Vasya won’t run out of socks in n days at least given he already has that many socks. The challenge here is how to track the number of socks as days go by. After every m days, a pair of socks gets added.So, the solution we all think of is, to divide n by m and keep on going until we can no longer divide. In terms of code:cnt = nwhile n: cnt += (n / m) n = (n / m)But, this solution is wrong. Why? Because first of all, in the problem statement, they have only shown even cases but if you consider odd cases or cases which yield odd number after division, this solution fails.Consider input:10 2If we apply the solution above, then, the answer would be:10 2cnt = 10Iteration 1:cnt = 10 + (10 / 2) = 15n = 5Iteration 2:cnt = 15 + (5 / 2) = 17n = 2Iteration 3:cnt = 17 + (2 / 2) = 18n = 1Iteration 4:cnt = 18 + (1/ 2) = 18n = 0But, the problem is after thinking analytically, we know that solution is 19. We start with 10 socks, after 10 days, 5 socks(15 in total) will be added, during the new 5 days, 2 socks(17 in total) will be added, on the 16th day, a sock will be added (18 in total) and lastly, a sock will be added on 18th day. But, our solution doesn’t calculate the last sock and hence, our answer is 18 rather than 19.So, what is missing in our solution? We are not adding the remainders after division. Thus, our new and correct solution will be:cnt = nwhile n >= m: cnt += (n / m) n = ((n / m) + (n % m))Now, if you check, this on case 10 2 , then the answer will be 19.CodePythonn, m = list(map(int, input().split()))cnt = nwhile n >= m: cnt += (n // m) n = ((n // m) + (n % m))print(cnt)C++#include <iostream>using namespace std;int main() { int n, m; cin >> n >> m; int cnt = n; while (n >= m) {  cnt += (n / m);   n = ((n / m) + (n % m));  } cout << cnt << endl;}Written byAbhishek VermaI like to write about concepts related to deep learning and artificial intelligence.FollowProgrammingMathematicsMathComputer ScienceJob InterviewMore from Abhishek VermaFollowI like to write about concepts related to deep learning and artificial intelligence.More From MediumPull request template for the win!Jakub Anioła in RSQ TechnologiesFile Input Using Ionic Action SheetSergey Rudenko in JavaScript In Plain English4 Apps Must Install On Your Mac for Development in 2020Jason Zhang in The StartupDetroit and London Schools of Test-Driven DevelopmentMaciej Falski in Dev GeniusFrom Bumbling to Bundling with Webpack and RollupSean Nemann in Beam DentalA Video Player, Svelte, and LodashArmand De AsisDeploying Laravel Projects to KubernetesLukas Gentele in The StartupBetter Errors Messages for FlutterStefan Matthias Aust in ICNHAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Karatsuba Multiplication,https://medium.com/@spamjaneya/karatsuba-multiplication-97480d6a059c?source=tag_archive---------5-----------------------,"Mathematics,Algorithms,Divide And Conquer,Data Structures","SourceThis multiplication algorithm is particularly important for dealing with large numbers and reducing the computation time by using the concept of divide and conquer!Traditional multiplication has the running time O(n²) while the Karatsuba algorithm is O(n^(1.59)).SourceSo how does this algorithm work?We’ll solve this using an example: X = 5634 and Y = 1278In X: let a = 56 and b = 34In Y: let c = 12 and d = 78Now, we compute the following:1. (a*c) = 6722. (b*d) = 26523. (a+b)*(c+d) = 81004. compute [3]-([1]+[2]) = 8100-(672+2652) = 4776Finally, we compute:(672 * 10⁴) + (2652) + (4776 * 10²)6 7 2 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 2 6 5 2+ 4 7 7 6 0 0 — — — — —  7 2 0 0 2 5 2 — — — — —This formula can be generalised as a recursive formula as given below:X = a * 10^(n/2) + bY = c * 10^(n/2) + dso X * Y = (a * c) * 10^n + ((a * d) + (b * c)) * 10^(n/2) + (b * d)Now, Gauss’ trick comes to our rescue while computing these values.Instead of having 4 multiplication operations, 3 multiplication operations are sufficient for this algorithm.(a * d) + (b * c) = (a + b) * (c + d) — (a * c) — (b * d)Thus, this algorithm implements divide and conquer with an optimized way to calculate the product of two numbers.We can use this for large numbers too by treating the numbers as strings instead of integer values and performing the above steps.Pretty cool right?Written byAnjaneya TripathiLive.

How do people use math today?,https://medium.com/@BrainQuake/how-do-people-use-math-today-4d73ffe1d7be?source=tag_archive---------6-----------------------,"Game Based Learning,Mathematics,Mathematics Education,Optimization,Number Sense","Students working on the BrainQuake Gears puzzle (in the original Wuzzit Trouble app). The more advanced Gears puzzles do not have unique “right” answers. They are all about finding optimal solutions under a constraint. You can optimize the number of bonus items collected (and in some cases the number of penalty items avoided), and the number of moves taken, but you have to collect all your bonus items before you collect the final key. That requires a range of important 21st Century math skills.I don’t know the answer to that question. Other than to say they use it in lots of different ways.I can say that, in many cases, people use math without knowing it, since we have succeeded in creating mathematical tools that where the math is completely hidden.Google is one example. Search engines are implementations of mathematical algorithms — more complex versions of the familiar procedures we have for adding, multiplying, subtracting, and dividing numbers. Similarly, when we look for items to buy on Amazon or any online store and then place an order, we are instructing mathematical algorithms to meet our needs. In fact, almost anything we do online involves us setting in motion a sequence of mathematical activities.But what about uses of math where the person doing it does more than just press keys or select icons on a smart-screen? What kinds of problems do people work on where they need to have, and use, math skills?Again, I’d have to answer that they use math in lots of different ways, on a wide range of problems. I can however be more precise in saying what I think* are the kinds of problems where people most frequently use math skills. They are, for the most part, not problems that require calculation of an answer — be that answer a number, a mathematical formula, or a graph. Rather they are optimization problems, where the goal is do something faster, cheaper, safer, more efficiently, more accurately, or better in some other way.[* I admit I do not know for a fact that the majority of applications of math today are optimization problems. I’m not even sure it would be possible to conduct a study to find that out, since math can get into issues in many different ways and to very different extents, so it’s not clear what you should count as a math application. But I do know from my own experience working as a professional mathematician for almost half a century, that optimization problems loom very large on the spectrum of real-life applications of math, and my sense is that they are in fact the majority where the math involvement is dominant.]The point is, the basic mathematical skillset required to work on optimization problems (faster, cheaper, safer, more efficiently, more accurately, or better in some other way) is not the one that was dominant before the world had comuters. Rather, it includes skills such as number sense, mathematical thinking, creative problem solving ability (including problems that require multiple steps to solve), a familiarity with mathematical abstractions, and a positive attitude to mathematics coupled with a sense of mathematical efficacy (mindset).Notably, the list does not include arithmetic and algebra skills. Computers can do those today. (Though be careful. Students almost certainly need to spend some time learning how to do arithmetic and algebra, in order to acquire the skills I listed in that last paragraph. Arithmetic and algebra are not going away. But the goal of that learning is no longer because students will need to execute the various procedures mentally or by hand. The focus today has to be on understanding rather than speed, fluency, or accuracy of execution.)Beyond that basic skills list, there are some specialized branches of mathematics that are used over-and-over again, the top of the list for optimization problems being linear algebra. But those speciality disciplines can vary from one problem domain to another.As I have mentioned on this blog a number of times, that list of basic, 21st Century mathematical skills is precisely the ones we design our math learning tools to help develop. We founded BrainQuake precisely to provide 21st Century learning tools that could meet that 21st Century need.The three puzzles in the new BrainQuake app present challenges in positive whole number arithmetic and algebra (Gears puzzle), in fractions and proportions (Tanks puzzle), and linear functions, equations, and growth (Tiles puzzle, which also has an element of spatial reasoning). While they help develop basic computational skills in those areas, the three puzzles are primarily designed to develop the range of higher-level 21st Century math skills listed in the article. The three parts of mathematics on which the puzzles are built are used as vehicles to develop those more general skills.Incidentally, the math that underlies those “MATH INSIDE” companies like Google, Amazon, etc. is almost entirely optimization math.– KeithWritten byBrainQuakeDeveloping children’s true math proficiencyFollowGame Based LearningMathematicsMathematics EducationOptimizationNumber SenseMore from BrainQuakeFollowDeveloping children’s true math proficiencyMore From MediumLet’s Derive the Ideal Gas Law from Scratch!Joseph Mellor in Cantor’s ParadiseNewton’s Shell TheoremWojciech Wieczorek in Cantor’s ParadiseOn Truncated Toeplitz operatorsRewayat Khan in Cantor’s ParadiseThe Anarchist Abstractionist — Who was Alexander Grothendieck?Jørgen Veisdal in Cantor’s ParadiseCalculus for Data Science and ML: IntegralsAdrià Serra in AI In Plain EnglishWhy a·0=0 and Other Proofs of “the Obvious”Slawomir Chodnicki in The StartupExtending Einstein’s Field EquationsNicolus Rotich in Cantor’s ParadiseRandom Walk Introduction — Beautiful MathematicsDipro MondalAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
What was the secret of Shakuntala Devi’s calculating abilities?,https://medium.com/@preetamhegde/what-was-the-secret-of-shakuntala-devis-calculating-abilities-cbb09a58f81d?source=tag_archive---------7-----------------------,"Shakuntala Devi,Shakuntala Devi Movie,Memory Improvement,Mathematician,Mathematics","In my teenage,i saw a pamphlet on free workshop on memory training from a guy from Mysore.Out of curiosity, just went to the workshop to know whats in it. Workshop had audience of all ages. From children to adults aged 50+.So in that trainer, gave brief into memory techniques and gave a small demo where he asked to fill 50 random two digit numbers in 50 cells.This symbolic image. We asked him fill random digits in all cells ranged 1–99.And yes, he could tell which number was in which cell and vice-versa. And offered a paid workshop to know how he did it.He could do most of the tricks what Shakuntala Devi used to do in her shows.for example1.Memorize complete periodic table.2.Large digit multiplications.3.Tell which day of date of any year.4.Memorize phone numbers of 100+ contacts.Just to know how he did it we signed up for the paid workshop.In the workshop we learnt the left side of the brain is responsible for controlling the right side of the body. It also performs tasks that have to do with logic, such as in science and mathematics. On the other hand, the right hemisphere coordinates the left side of the body, and performs tasks that have do with creativity and the arts.So the trick to remember large numbers is to associate numbers with objects and person we are familiar with. So he asked us to make a list of 100 people whom we are familiar with and assigned asked us to assign each with one number. These are called mental files(journal system) which help you memorizing large numbers.The method of using your right brain creativity to memorize things is termed as Major system or Pegging system.This system is so useful if you just want rote everything and clear your examination just by memorizing details mechanically. You can astound people at parties just like Shakuntala Devi did. The workshop trainer made his living teaching these tricks all over India having workshops.Although we know how Shakuntala Devi did large arithmetic calculations, it takes lot of effort to practice and memorize large numbers and sums in front of large audience. Interestingly i never come across any source where she has revealed secrets of her tricks. But recently in one of her videos i observed she was mumbling some random English letters like ‘C E E P D’.For more info on Major system memory technique you can refer following links.https://artofmemory.com/wiki/Major_Systemhttps://litemind.com/major-system/https://major-system.info/en/Written byPreetam HegdeFollow1 1 1 Shakuntala DeviShakuntala Devi MovieMemory ImprovementMathematicianMathematicsMore from Preetam HegdeFollowMore From MediumVisualizing Hope for a Successful, Data-Driven, COVID19 Re-OpeningChristian Felix in NightingaleThe Ultimate Python Package to Pre-Process Data for Machine LearningNirBarazida in The StartupSegmenting with Mixed Type Data — A Case Study Using K-Medoids on Subscription DataDiego Usai in Analytics VidhyaKeras ImageDataGenerator’s ‘flow’ Methods, and When to Use ThemSam Thurman in The StartupPredict Data without PythonSannidhi SivaGet to Know the Models Guiding Coronavirus PolicyAndre Ye in The StartupUnleashing the real power of data: an interview with Máximo GurméndezArion in arionkoderAll* perfect pangrams of EnglishCalvin LiAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
"<strong class=""bt"">Interpret Neural Networks Through Dynamical Systems</strong>",https://medium.com/@chirathhettiarachchi/interpret-neural-networks-through-dynamical-systems-43a7d907f610?source=tag_archive---------8-----------------------,"Neural Networks,Dynamical Systems,Machine Learning,Deep Learning,Mathematics","Photo by Uriel Santillan Carrion on UnsplashNeural Networks & Deep Learning are extremely popular topics of discussion among computer science enthusiasts and general public alike. Where many possess a very basic understanding on how these models are driving Artificial Intelligence through a learning process. Simply put, these techniques are able to learn intelligent tasks when we provide data (e.g. ability to classify between cat’s vs dogs given labelled data, current systems are much more intelligent than this!!!).Neural Networks (or Artificial Neural Networks) were developed, inspired by the biological neurons in the brain. These man-made networks are build-up of simple processing units called artificial neurons which works in parallel and has the ability to gain experiential knowledge through a learning process [1]. Different types of Neural Network architectures (Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Deep Residual Networks…) have shown impressive breakthroughs in areas such as image classification, natural language processing, and speech recognition. However, they are still considered as “black box” models since we lack proper understanding and explanations on how these networks operate.In this article we focus on using Dynamical Systems in order to interpret the behaviour of Neural Networks and try to demystify them. We explored dynamical systems and their characteristics in our previous articles.Summarising the previous articles, a Dynamical system is a system where the states evolve with time, based on a fixed rule, over a state space. Example: The motion of a simple pendulum. The position, velocity (states) would vary based on some physical law with time (visit the previous articles to understand these concepts and vector fields related to dynamical systems).Recent research has used dynamical systems as a framework to explain the underlying concepts of neural networks. In the paper “A proposal on machine learning via dynamical systems” by Weinan, E. (2017) [2] this idea was introduced. This article focuses on summarising the main ideas, the reader is directed towards recent publications for rigorous mathematical proof.One main aspect of Machine Learning is to identify a mathematical model (function) which can represent a given set of data based on some desired accuracy. For an example in the following graph the task is to identify a model which can represent temperature data. The ability to identify such a mathematical model (function) helps us understand the data and to predict future data.Image Credit: https://github.com/eriklindernoren/ML-From-Scratch, Copyright © 2017 Erik Linder-Norén, MIT LicenseIn classical approximation theory this model estimation is carried out starting from simple functions, these simple functions were combined (through addition & multiplication) together to construct more complex functions to fit the target data (e.g. addition of multiple sine waves in Fourier series to approximate a signal). Different basis functions, wavelets, splines have been used in this approach and the main limitation can be identified as the curse of dimensionality (i.e. issues arising in high dimensional spaces, and not in low dimensions).Neural networks are more complicated models which try to learn a more complex mathematical function. The main difference in neural networks is the use of “compositions of functions”, compared to the addition and multiplication of functions in classical approximation theory. This aspect is summarised below. Each layer of the neural network can be identified as a function which is fed into another function in the next layer (f1(f2(f3(x)))). We explore dynamical systems to understand these compositions.Image by AuthorRecall from the previous articles that continuous time dynamical systems can be represented by the following equation below. These continuous equations are solved using different numerical approximation methods. The corresponding discrete dynamical system can be obtained through the Forward Euler Approximation. An example vector field from the previous article shown below, represents how sample trajectories vary with time over the state space (i.e. the dynamical nature).Image by AuthorIn neural networks, at each layer there is a linear transformation (weight*x + bias) followed by a component wise non-linear activation (e.x. sigmoid, ReLU). There are multiple such layers in a network combined through compositions. This can be viewed as a discrete dynamical system where at each layer there is some kind of a transformation which converts one space to another. Compared to the above graph where a state (point in space) is transformed to another state (point in space) according to a fixed rule, here you can consider it as a flow map of different spaces. This idea is further illustrated in the figure below, where each layer represents a vector space, which is transformed to another vector space, similar to the nature of a dynamical system.Image by AuthorLet’s try to understand this idea further through an example. In image classification, the CNN’s learn different features at each layer. Starting from simple pixels first they learn to identify edges, next they try to identify parts of an object, finally they learn to identify the final image. These different features are identified at different layers of the network. Hence, this can be understood as a flow map, where each layer represents a different feature space. Along the layers these feature spaces are transformed and finally we obtain our desired result.To establish this idea mathematically we can think of a Residual Network. A Residual Network is similar to general networks, but they possess skipped connection from one layer to another. This can be identified by the equation and diagram below, which represents a residual block. This equation at a given layer of the network is the same as the discrete dynamical system equation which we identified earlier. Hence, Residual Networks can be interpreted as a discrete dynamical system.Image by AuthorBut how can non-residual networks be interpreted through dynamical systems?Yang et al in their ICML 2020 paper “Interpolation between Residual and Non-Residual Networks”, explores this aspect [3]. They propose a continuous dynamical system with damping and establishes the relationship between dynamical systems and CNN’s.There are many other interesting relationships and aspect which can be analysed when neural networks are viewed as dynamical systems. How can different network architectures / structural diversity be understood? How can stability of neural networks be analysed? Recent research has explored these aspects, where network architectures are analysed through different numerical approximation methods (In this article we identified that the Forward Euler approximation related to simple residual networks). Neural networks experience issues such as vanishing / exploding gradients, whereas in dynamical systems also chaotic behaviours, dynamic explosions can be seen. Through the stability analysis of dynamical systems, we can explore these issues. These aspects will be discussed in the next article. I hope this article provided you with the basic idea on understanding neural networks through dynamical systems.Image by AuthorReferences[1] Chapter 1, Neural Networks & Learning Machines, by Simon Haykin.[2] Weinan, E.

"On mathematics, teaching & academia: Dr. Lara Alcock",https://medium.com/@maleehakhawaja/on-mathematics-teaching-academia-dr-lara-alcock-d83e0241d12a?source=tag_archive---------9-----------------------,"Mathematics,Mathematics Education,Teaching,Academia","“Beautiful, varied, creative”…this is how Dr. Lara Alcock (Loughborough University) describes mathematics. Last year, I had the opportunity to ask her about what draws her to mathematics, teaching and her job as a university academic.Dr. Lara AlcockDr. Lara Alcock is the head of the Mathematics Education Centre at Loughborough University as well as a reader in mathematics education. Her research focuses on undergraduate mathematics education, specifically psychological studies on mathematical thinking and learning.In 2012, Dr. Alcock received the Selden Prize for her distinctive contributions to this field. In 2015, she was awarded a National Teaching Fellowship by the Higher Education Academy.She is the author of several research-based books on mathematics, including How to Study for a Mathematics Degree. You can find out more about them here.What drew you most to mathematics? Was there ever anything else you wanted to go in to?I have always loved mathematics — my favourite toys growing up were the ones involving numbers or geometric patterns. I was also interested in space and for a while, as a young teenager, thought I might be interested in astrophysics. By the time I was choosing my A levels, it was clear that mathematics was my thing.What do you find most fulfilling about your career as an academic?I think, overall, simply finding ways to communicate effectively about mathematics. I like all parts of my job — teaching, conducting research studies on how people think about mathematics, working with PhD students, and supporting others in my role as Head of Department in the Mathematics Education Centre.What I really enjoy most is lecturing and writing explanations and tasks to help people understand mathematical concepts and reasoning.As an experienced and high-level researcher, how do you explain concepts to beginning students? Is there a specific strategy that you take or something that you keep in mind?Well, I have an easy job here because my research is in mathematics education, and my focus is on mathematical thinking at the transition to undergraduate study.I have been able to spend more time than most developing knowledge about how students tend to think when they first start learning mathematics at that level. For me, this is a question about translating research-based knowledge into explanations and activities likely to connect with student thinking.I also tend to acknowledge — I hope in a light-touch way — how students are likely to feel when making that difficult transition. I find that for some students, it makes a lot of difference to know that their struggles are entirely normal.What is one piece of advice you would give to young and/or aspiring mathematicians?Keep asking why, find good people to talk to about your mathematics, and develop your organisational skills and resilience. Talent certainly helps but, as with everything in life, success also requires self-discipline and persistence.Is there anything else you’d like to add?Yes: mathematics is a beautiful, varied, creative, and intellectually stimulating subject. I am always delighted to see students rise to the challenge and enjoy the sense of developing their own knowledge and reasoning skills.My deepest thanks to Dr. Alcock for her time and patience in conducting this interview. My thanks also to Adam Hennessey for his assistance in arranging it.Written byMaleeha KhawajaFollowMathematicsMathematics EducationTeachingAcademiaMore from Maleeha KhawajaFollowMore From MediumWhy do Extra Spacetime Dimensions Unify the Fundamental Forces?Tim Andersen, Ph.D. in The Infinite UniverseA Pool + Treadmill + Human = Physics HomeworkRhett Allain in Geek PhysicsThe Greatest K to 12 Math Problem EverSunil Singh in Q.E.D.What is Modern Mathematics?Maths and Musings in justanothermathmoRichard Feynman’s First LectureJørgen Veisdal in Cantor’s ParadiseWhat is the Probabilistic Method?Matthew Ward in Cantor’s ParadiseWhat Is a Fractal?Bryan Dijkhuizen, BA. in CuriousFantastical Primes and Where to Find ThemApoorva PanidapuAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Otra forma de ver las funciones,https://medium.com/@math.notes/otra-forma-de-ver-las-funciones-7690703a3c6a?source=tag_archive---------10-----------------------,Mathematics,"Cuando se habla de funciones matemáticas lo más común es pensar en ellas como una transformación o un cálculo que nos lleva a un valor, muchas veces dependiendo de otros. Un ejemplo con notación estándar sería:f(x) = 2x + 5La función f nos da un valor resultado si substituimos la x por cualquier número:f(2) = 2 · 2 + 5 = 9f(0) = 5f(-1) = -2 + 5 = 3Pero se pueden definir las funciones de una forma algo más formal usando para ello, de nuevo, conjuntos.Para verlo, primero voy a definir antes una operación interesante sobre conjuntos. El producto cartesiano (x) de dos conjuntos es otro conjunto formado por pares ordenados de elementos, tomados uno de cada uno de los conjuntos. Si mis conjuntos son los siguientes:A = { 2, 3 }B = { 0, 7, 5 }Su producto cartesiano, representado por A x B, es:A x B = { (2, 0), (2, 7), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 7), (3, 5) }Se puede expresar de forma más general y formal así:A x B = { (a, b) | a ∈ A y b ∈ B }Nada nos impide realizar el producto cartesiano de un conjunto con él mismo, así por ejemplo:A x A = { (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3) }Nuestra función f se parece mucho a esto si nos damos cuenta de que forma pares implícitamente al relacionar el valor de la x con el resultado del cálculo, o sea:f = { (2, 9), (0, 5), (-1, 3)… }Estamos entonces creando una relación entre elementos, pero, ¿cuáles son los conjuntos?. Cuando dije antes que podíamos substituir la x por cualquier número, no especifiqué qué tipo de número. Podríamos definir la función sobre cualquiera de los conjuntos de números existentes.Por ejemplo, podemos decidir que x sea un número real, es decir, x∈ ℝ. Si es así, se puede demostrar que el resultado de nuestro cálculo también va a pertenecer a ℝ. Es decir, que f relaciona elementos de ℝ con elementos de ℝ y, por lo tanto:f ⊆ ℝ x ℝf es un subconjunto del producto cartesiano de ℝ con ℝ.Written byMath notesEspacio dedicado al estudio de las matemáticas.FollowMathematicsMore from Math notesFollowEspacio dedicado al estudio de las matemáticas.More From MediumAI has unlocked a key scientific hurdle in predicting our worldJames Green in Towards Data ScienceA Beautiful Way to Calculate π: Buffon’s Needle ProblemAli in However, MathematicsWhen Cantor Taught us to CountUjjwal Singh in Cantor’s ParadiseThe Chaos of Weather PredictionCole Persch in Cantor’s ParadiseDonald Trump Won, No Matter What Happens NextJessica Wildfire in The Apeiron Blog(Why) There Was no Biden Landslideumair haque in Eudaimonia and Co20 Things Most People Learn Too Late In LifeNicolas Cole in Better Advice“Anyone but Bernie”, They Said.Lauren Martinchek in Dialogue & DiscourseAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

That chances of randomly arriving at that number 1/10,000 if you took 4 slots and began injecting random numbers in them. On the surface what can you say about 6147, that it’s divisible by 3 or that it’s an odd number?Well, 6147 was dubbed Kaprekar’s Constant in 1949 and it has a unique property in relation to nearly any other 4-digit number. This property is known as Kaperekar’s Routine.Suppose you have a 4-digit number (with at least 2 different digits) you can perform Kaprekar’s routine.Choosing 7238 as our test subject, I guarantee you within 7 iterations of special subtraction we will end up with 6147.First, we take 7238 and rearrange to make the largest 4-digit number possible.8732 right?Now we subtract the opposite of this number — 2378 from 8732.8732–2378 = 6354Now repeat the step again so we get 6543 (largest number from the difference)Reverse the order to get — 3456 and let’s do our subtraction again.6543–3456 = 3087By now you should understand the steps. So I will fast forward and start calculating.8730–378 = 83528532–2358 = 6147And Bingo, in less than 7 iterations we got our magic number 6147.If you are more interested in understanding why Kaprekar’s Routine occurs check out this pdf link: I’m a pdf linkWritten byAdarsh BulusuInnovation Enthusiast.FollowMathematicsMathNumbersEducationMore from Adarsh BulusuFollowInnovation Enthusiast.More From MediumThe Erdős–Szekeres theoremHaris Angelidakis in Cantor’s ParadiseClaude Shannon, the Las Vegas SharkNautilusZero is nothing but a numberWaldo Otis in However, MathematicsThere’s A 25% Chance The United States Will Collapse Within 81 YearsKesh Anand in PredictPowers of Two: Ones, Tens, and Hundreds of DigitsJoaquin de Castro in Cantor’s ParadiseUnderstanding Monoids using real life examplesShashank BaravaniPtolemy’s Incredible TheoremJulia Fisher in Cantor’s ParadiseLinear Algebra 6 | Full Rank, Projection Matrix, And Orthogonal MatrixAdam Edelweiss in SereneFieldAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Quantum Formalism Batch I,https://medium.com/@Zaiku/quantum-formalism-batch-i-936c3e8fb8a?source=tag_archive---------12-----------------------,"Quantum Computing,Quantum Physics,Mathematics,Math,Technology","We’re pleased to announce that the start date of our free 12-week online course Quantum Formalism will be Friday, September 18th. The course has two tracks:Track 1: Aimed at helping scientists & software engineers working in the industry that are interested in getting into quantum computing, but that have a limited relevant mathematical background. We hope that mathematics will provide a shortcut to those interested in quantum software & algorithms without needing to have a PhD in quantum physics! :)Track 2: Aimed at those professionals who are already working in quantum computing and would like to be exposed to more advanced mathematical topics that are normally only accessible to mathematical physicists. We’re talking about topics like C*-Algebras & Operator Theory, Lie Groups & Lie Algebras etc.In general, we believe that re-skilling the existing industry software engineering workforce should indeed be part of the strategy to accelerate the development of a global quantum economy for the NISQ era and beyond. There are many examples of why this is so important, including:Having a large enough pool of skilled quantum software engineers would help new quantum software startups across industries access industry-ready quantum engineering talent. Currently, a lot of quantum computing talent are coming from the already drained academia. However, from our own experience, often these academics lack the industry experience in terms of high quality software engineering standards.Big tech such as; Google, IBM, Microsoft and Amazon are leveraging their deep pockets to heavily recruit quantum talent from academia or engaged in poaching from startups, hence making it much harder for new entrants to access talent.Batch I SizeFor this first pilot batch, we’ve capped the numbers to 100 students for the live lectures and tried our best to select people from diverse backgrounds across the US & Europe. However, we’re open to expanding the number of students as needed to admit more women and people of colour. The lectures will also be recorded and made available on our YouTube Channel.Some of our registered students are already taking part in IBM’s quantum computation summer school called ‘ 2020 Qiskit Global Summer School’.Batch I PartnershipIn our recent internal pre-course research, we’ve found that 15% would like to start a quantum startup or join one as an early employee! So we are looking to partner with incubators and quantum startups in order to create pilot pathways for those promising potential quantum founders & early startup employees.Interested partners, please fill out this google form so we can follow up with you: https://forms.gle/nrvhidVRjU1maQFH6In the future, we may consider starting a consortium of global incubators working together rather than competing with each other so that we can help to create the next-generation of deep-tech companies that will create a better world for all of us.Thanks for reading!

100 dias de código — dia 13 — Encontrando Pi,https://medium.com/@rafaeljsouza/100-dias-de-c%C3%B3digo-dia-13-encontrando-pi-5898884058d9?source=tag_archive---------13-----------------------,"Algorithms,Coding,Python,Programming,Mathematics","Hoje não vamos resolver um problema do Projeto Euler. Meu querido amigo Eugenio me falou sobre uma demonstração muito curiosa: se você pegar uma sequência de pares de números, a chance deles serem coprimos é 6/pi², que é uma forma muito curiosa de achar o valor de pi já que, chamando essa chance de x, podemos dizer que pi = raiz quadrada de 6/x.Falei, ‘peraí, como é?’ e entendendo melhor o problema escrevi esse código aquiimport randomfrom math import sqrtimport timestart = time.time()#parte 1def coprimes(lista1, lista2):    for item1 in lista1:        for item2 in lista2:            if item1 == item2:                return False    return True#parte 2lista = []for i in range(1000):    random.seed()    a = random.randint(1,1001)    random.seed()    b = random.randint(1,1001)    lista.append([a,b])#parte 3lista_coprimos = []for par in lista:     lista_a = []     lista_b = []     for a in range(2, par[0]):         if par[0] % a == 0:             lista_a.append(a)     for b in range(2, par[1]):         if par[1] % b == 0:             lista_b.append(b)     if coprimes(lista_a,lista_b):         lista_coprimos.append(par)print(sqrt(6/(len(lista_coprimos)/len(lista))))print(time.time()- start)Eu sei que esse código pode ser otimizado, mas não sei exatamente como, ainda assim em poucos segundos ele chega em aproximações bem boas.Importamos algumas bibliotecas que vamos usar. Na parte 1, definimos a função coprimes que vai receber duas listas e verificar se os itens de uma lista constam na outra. Sei que passar cada item de uma lista por todas as outras é um pouco de exagero e deve ter alguma forma mais eficiente de fazer isso, mas eu sinceramente não sei como. Eu sei que, por exemplo, posso fazerlista_de_compras = ['banana', 'maçã', 'laranja']print('banana' in lista_de_compras)e isso vai retornar True e eu poderia fazer uma lista de divisores testar cada um de seus itens pra ver se existe na outra, mas não pensei isso na hora e não sei se seria muito mais eficiente. Enfim, se nenhum dos divisores for comum, a função devolve verdadeiro. Nós vamos garantir que todos os divisores vão ser maiores que 1 no código do laço.Na parte 2, geramos os pares de números. Inicializamos uma lista vazia e então um laço com o número de pares que queremos. Vamos gerar uma semente para número aleatório e vamos gerar um número a usando a função randint() do python. Depois geramos uma nova semente aleatória e usamos randint() pra gerar um número b, enfim construimos uma lista com os dois números e adicionamos essa lista à lista vazia anterior. Nas primeiras versões desse código não levamos em consideração mudar a semente da função random do python. Sabemos que o gerador é de um código pseudoaleatório, então não nos preocupamos muito, mas ao fazermos essa modificação pra alterar a semente da função random a cada geração de número, conseguimos uma aproximação final mais consistente (ainda que anedoticamente).A lista é feita com mil pares de números de 1 a 1000. Podemos gerar mais ou menos pares com mais ou menos casas decimais, mas depois de testar bastante, notamos que não faz tanta diferença assim ter muitos mais pares de muitos mais digitos. Anedoticamente parece que usar 10000 pares de 1 a 10mil rende números mais consistentemente próximos de 3.14 no final, mas não testamos exaustivamente.Na parte 3 inicializamos uma lista vazia que vai receber os coprimos. Então para cada par na lista, inicializamos uma lista a e outra b vazias e então encontramos todos os divisores maiores que 1 de cada um dos números dos pares e adicionamos na lista respectiva (a ou b). Após completar a lista de divisores, testamos com a função coprimes e verificamos se os números são coprimos. Se forem, adicionamos a lista de coprimos. Pensando agora, seria mais fácil ser um contador já que só queremos saber quantos dos pares são coprimos e não quais são. Alterando para um contador não traz mudança significativa no tempo de execução do código, fica a dica hahaPor fim, calculamos a raiz quadradada de 6/(a quantidade de coprimos/quantidade de pares) e depois o tempo gasto. Na média pra essa quantidade, depois de em torno de 0.15 segundos, encontramos algo em torno de 3.04 e 3.21, mas frequentemente 3.14 como agora :)Quem quiser conferir o vídeo em que o camarada explica de onde vem essa forma de encontrar o pi:Written byRafael SouzaFollowAlgorithmsCodingPythonProgrammingMathematicsMore from Rafael SouzaFollowMore From MediumJava 8 and beyond, The Whistle-Stop TourJames CollertonHow Transformers WorkJames Briggs in Towards Data ScienceA Beautiful Way to Calculate π: Buffon’s Needle ProblemAli in However, MathematicsAI has unlocked a key scientific hurdle in predicting our worldJames Green in Towards Data ScienceWhen Cantor Taught us to CountUjjwal Singh in Cantor’s ParadiseWhy do we have to wrap React components?Aaron S in JavaScript In Plain EnglishA/B testing machine learning models in productionCaleb Kaiser in Towards Data ScienceThe Chaos of Weather PredictionCole Persch in Cantor’s ParadiseAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
There is no freedom without Math,https://medium.com/@alfonso.ochoa/there-is-no-freedom-without-math-3d6356d873a?source=tag_archive---------14-----------------------,"Math,Freedom,Mathematics,Universe,Politics","When humans learned to apply Mathematics, we experienced an economic and scientific growth. We all know the results in medicine, biology, physics and most recently in economics and finance, as well as other social sciences. And we barely discuss their influence in arts, such music, literature, cinema and.. freedom.Mathematics help us read and understand the Universe; they hide beneath their curves and their forms maintain kingdoms; from small atoms to the creation of galaxies.Math is a universal language. They transcend time. Their meaning is the same today, tomorrow or 500 years ago. I strongly disagree with those who say it is necessary to be a mathematician to appreciate them and let be led by their wisdom. It is almost as saying that only a dancer can appreciate a Broadway show.Mathematics is about abstract thinking and pattern recognition. Human capacity to quantify these patterns is what makes us unique and sets us apart from the animal kingdom. It gives us the ability to build cities, forecast sales, elaborate algorithms and send men to the Moon.I am not a Mathematician. I am an economist and my relationship with Math was not always this lovely. At one point I got a 20 in an exam. When I visited the teacher to review the score, he told me “You probably deserved less”.Math is probably the tool that elevates our species to our best selves. Men crash on religion, culture, race, but when it comes to scientific knowledge and math, people tend to be brought together with ourselves and the Universe itself.What does it have to do with freedom? If we want to get some kind of progress in our lives, we need indicators. We need to evaluate cause and effect. This way there will be no ambiguity. Every step will be solid.It is somehow easy to determine if a society is free or not. If you are able to determine whether or not their politicians and society are ruled by a set of scientific-measurable standards or if they simple act under a doctrine and plain politics.Every time you listen to a politician talk, ask yourself if his ideas area measurable. It is not only about numbers, equations and formulas, it is about freely exploring the truth.

The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic,https://medium.com/cantors-paradise/the-fundamental-theorem-of-arithmetic-37470aa1a7a0?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Mathematics,Education,Technology,Computer Science,Programming","Over 2,300 years ago, Euclid proved the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Now it is our turn.Some surviving fragments from Euclid’s ElementsStatement of the TheoremThe Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic states that we can decompose any number uniquely into the product of prime numbers. For example, 350 = 2*7*5², and there is no other way to write 350 as the product of prime numbers.ProofPart I: Bezout’s LemmaBezout’s lemma tells us that, if two numbers a and b share no prime factors other than 1 and -1, then we can find q and s such that qa+sb=1.Ok, let’s take some time to digest that with a worked example. Consider 7, and 9. The only numbers with divide 7 are {7,1,-1,-7}. The only numbers which divide 9 are {9,3,1,-1,-3,-9}. So, 7 and 9 share no prime factors. Our task is now to find two numbers q and s such that 7q + 9s = 1.Well, we could guess a few numbers, and perhaps we find that 9*3 = 27, and 7*4 = 28. So we could try q=4, and s=-3. Then:7*4–9*3 = 1.Bezout Lemma ProofMy note: if you get really stuck on the proof of Bezout’s Lemma, then it’s ok to skip to the next section. Try and get a feel for why it works even if you don’t understand every detail.Previously I guessed a few numbers until I found that 7*4–9*3=1.However, guessing doesn’t prove things in general . We now prove the result again for the case of 7 and 9, but ‘pretend’ we haven’t just guessed the result, and find it systematically. This systematic method works on all numbers!We use the Euclidean Algorithm. That means we use division with remainder to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers, which in our case is 1. Then, we reverse the steps of the algorithm to prove we can write 1 as a combination of 9’s and 7’s.Take 7 and 9.9 = 7 + 27 = 3*2 + 1We then want to rebuild 1 in terms of 7’s and 9’s. We do this as follows:1 = 7–3*21 = 7–3(9–7)1=7–3*9 +3*7 = 4*7–3*9Do you see how we ‘break down’ our two numbers to produce a 1, and then rebuild ‘1’ using 7’s and 9’s from the pieces. Let’s see this in action again.This time our numbers are 49 and 51.51 = 49 + 249 = 2*24 + 1Now we reconstruct:1 = 49–2*241 = 49–24(51–49)1 = 25*49–24*51Given any two numbers which don’t share a factor, we can go through the same process, just potentially with more steps. We do one final example.Our numbers are 99 and 35.99 = 2*35 + 2935 = 29 + 629 = 4*6 + 56 = 1*5 + 1Now we reconstruct:1 = 6–51=6-(29–4*6) = 5*6–291=5*(35–29) — 29 = 5*35 -6*291=5*35 — 6*(99–2*35)=17*35–6*99Part II: Euclid’s LemmaEuclid’s lemma says that if a prime number p divides x times y, then p divides x, or p divides y (and potentially both).For example, 3 divides 3465=99*35. Euclid’s lemma says that 3 divides 99, or 3 divides 35. We can see that 3 divides 99, as 99=3*33Suppose p divides xy, but that p doesn’t divide x. Then, by Bezout’s Lemma, we can find a t, s such that:t*p + s*x = 1Then, multiply through by y:t*p*y + s*x*y = y.Divide by p:t*y +s*xy/p = y/pAs xy/p is an integer, we deduce that y/p is an integer, and therefore p divides y.We repeat these steps with a worked example. Say we know that 3 divides 99*35, as 35*99=3*1155, but doesn’t divide 35. Then:12*3 +35(-1) =12*3 -35 = 112*3*99 -35*99 = 99.12*99–35*99/3 = 99/3As we know 35*99/3 is an integer, we therefore know 12*99–35*99/3 is an integer. And so 3 divides 99.Part III: Bringing it all togetherExistenceFirst we need to show that, given a number, we can write it as a product of primes. Take a number N. Suppose that all smaller numbers can be written as a product of primes. If no number smaller than N divides it, then N itself is prime. Otherwise, if a smaller number divides it, say, N = ab, we can write a and b as a product of primes, and therefore we can write N as a product of primes.As we did previously, we give a worked example to go alongside this rather abstract proof. Suppose we know that {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11} can all be written as the product of primes. Then, we write 12 = 6*2. As we know that 6 can be written 3*2, we conclude that 12=3*2*2. Therefore knowing that the first 11 integers can be written as the product of primes allows us to prove that the 12th can be written as a product of primes. Once we know that 12 can be written as a product of primes, as we can prove that 13 can be written as a product of primes.This is known as strong induction, where knowing that some property for all previous cases (in this case, being able to write a number as the product of primes) allows us to prove that the next number, N+1, has that property (i.e. can be written as the product of primes)UniquenessFinally we prove uniqueness. It’s not enough to prove that we can write a number as the product of primes, we also want to show that there is only one way of doing so.First we do a worked example of what will be a somewhat abstract argument.Suppose someone claimed that 5*7²=7*11*3, and we wanted to prove this was false without explicitly calculating both sides. First, we divide both sides by 7, so that 7 doesn’t appear on both sides. Now the claim is tantamount to:5*7=11*3Now, by Euclid’s Lemma, we can prove this is impossible. This means that 5 divides 11*3. Therefore, 5 divides 11, or 5 divides 3. But these numbers are primes: the only numbers which divide them are themselves. So, this would imply that 5=11, or 5=3, which is patently absurd. Thus we can conclude that 5*7²=7*11*3 is a false statement.— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —Now we do the general proof.Suppose we can write a number as the product of primes in two ways. If there are any primes which appear on both sides, divide appropriately so that the two factorisations share no primes.Take our first prime, ‘p_1’. Clearly p_1 divides N. Now, as p_1 divides N, p_1 divides the second prime factorisation. By (repeated application of) Euclid’s Lemma, this means that p_1 divides one of the prime factors of N. But as these numbers are prime, p_1 must equal one of the prime factors. This is a contradiction, as we had already cancelled out all the shared prime factors.Thus, the factorisation into primes must be unique.Thanks for taking the time to learn some math :) I’m Ethan.

Do Numbers Really Exist?,https://medium.com/however-mathematics/do-numbers-really-exist-93721ead08fe?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Mathematics,Education,Philosophy,Creativity,Logic","Today we will try to understand numbers starting with natural numbers. When we say “understand numbers,” you may get the idea that numbers physically exist, and we want to understand those objects. For this reason, we should focus on what does “understanding numbers” mean? What can we understand about numbers? How much can we really understand numbers? How do we know that we really understand something like numbers? What is the type of understanding we have (for something like numbers)? We will focus on these questions from a profoundly philosophical perspective.Is there any difference between understanding numbers and understanding horses? The answer is yes. Horses exist physically, and they are tangible. They graze, run, and race. We can see them. We can understand the digestive system of horses because horses have such a system in their belly, which has existed without us knowing.Photo by Holly Mandarich on UnsplashHowever, we don’t see the numbers physically. I have never seen seven in action, and I am sure you have not seen it. Nobody has ever said, “I saw a beautiful seven running across the street” because number seven does not walk, fly, or gets hungry. Number seven does not die. Seven does nothing tangible. But, horses do a lot of things; we see them everywhere in action. But what about number seven? We can stand next to a horse and watch it, but we cannot stand next to number seven.“I saw a beautiful seven running across the street.”Though “seven horses” has a meaning, “seven” doesn’t have a meaning by itself. Actually, I stand corrected because the meaning and the existence of “a horse” is also arguable. The meaning of “horse” is also continuously changing. Each horse is different from the other, and again, any horse can change anytime physically. There isn’t “a single horse,” there are horses that are always changing. And there are horses which are not born yet. Therefore, “horse” is also conceptual. A horse is a common name for a set of creatures that look alike (physically), and the meaning of “horse” changes continuously from one horse to another. Actually, “a horse” is more tangible than we think. If “horse” is conceptual, then what do seven horses mean? Could seven of the same things be from the same concept? I believe seven horses means there are seven creatures from the idea of horses. And those seven creatures could change from one set of seven horses to another set. Since those creatures (or the collection of creatures) are continuously changing, we cannot understand the concept of the horses. So how can we understand seven of them?A horse is a horse, and it is there.Anyway, a horse is a horse, and it exists physically, somewhere. That is obvious. We cannot ignore it. However, numbers cannot live somewhere like horses. But can we say there aren’t any numbers because we don’t see them? We feel the numbers. Even if the numbers do not exist physically anywhere, they exist in our minds. Also, if they are mental, they do exist. If Descartes was writing this post today, he would say“I think of seven; therefore, seven exists.”Most of the people have five fingers on each hand, and it is a fact. We understand and accept the statement about our fingers, which contains the number “five.” So, we are giving a common meaning for five. That happens because the existence of five is independent of our existence.The concept of number “five” was also invented independently at different times by different communities. So the number “five” exists somewhere else independent of our existence. Five exists because when any community comes to a mental understanding level, they start to understand and accept the concept of five. The idea of five is not only for our world, but it is also universal. If there are aliens somewhere, they would still accept the concept of five.I think five is not just a mental thing. It should be somewhere. I do not know where exactly, but it is there somewhere, even if we don’t see or hear it. If there is no five, still, the concept of five exists. It exists just as an idea, but it exists. By the way, is there any thought of five different from mine, in the universe? Five exists because we are on the same page for the concept of “five.”Something or someone whispered that “five” exists, and when I process it in my brain, I find the idea of five. Understanding numbers is a simple topic, but it raises profound philosophical questions. I could not answer all questions raised entirely, I made some assumptions for numbers using some other assumptions, but I am still not 100% sure about my assumptions. If I am not entirely convinced, how can I convince you?While reaching this conclusion, we stopped talking about math. Whether “five” exists or not in nature, I just want to understand five. To understand five, first, we need to know five. Hence, we need to define five.Let’s try to do so. Assume that five is the number of fingers in one hand and assume that this statement is true for a moment and try to understand. After defining five, a question comes to my mind: what does understanding “five” mean? I am not going to understand five alone, and I am going to understand the relationship between five and other numbers. For instance, I want to figure out 5 + 3. If we define three fingers, we can say that 5+3 is the total number of fingers when we put five fingers and three fingers next to each other.Photo by Jonny Caspari on UnsplashSo if you put three more fingers next to five fingers, you get eight fingers. When you try, you will see it. If you try again, you will get the same result. However, there is a problem here; you cannot prove anything by just trying. You will never prove that you will get eight apples when you put three apples next to five apples. It is because your statement depends on an experiment. You can never prove that you will get the same result from an experiment forever. By the way, I am not saying you will not get eight apples when you put five apples and three apples. I am just telling you that you cannot show that you will get eight apples all the time. Physical experiments cannot prove things mathematically. If it happened, then it will happen again is not a proof, at least mathematically!But mathematics has proof. We need to prove the equation of 5+3=8. We have to! And if I define five as a number of the fingers on one hand, how can I define enormous numbers? And how can we describe the idea of numbers in general? One, two, three, four, five are defined. Seven and eight are also defined, but I need to stop at some point. We cannot define until infinity. Defining numbers one by one and defining the concept of a number is totally different. What are we going to do? First, we will distinguish the five that we use in our daily life and number five. The number five has no relation with our fingers. It will be a brand new definition, mathematically. But how? It doesn’t matter how we define the number five. We will define 3, 5, 8, and our addition, and then our equation will be mathematically valid.The method is not essential, but the results are! And this is one of the critical properties of math. In math, the method of definition is not important, but the thing that the mathematical concepts tell us is significant. This point of view applies not only to numbers but also to all other mathematical concepts. We don’t care how we define a point, a line, a plane, but we care about what those concepts explain or provide us.When we define some numbers, then we will define the set of natural numbers. Then we will define addition in natural numbers, and we will get 2+2=4. That implies x+y = y+x, which is known to everyone. The important thing is how we think mathematically and how we prove it.*** I wrote this article using my lecture notes from my professor Ali Nesin’s lecture notes.

“A New Kind of Science”. Kind of New. Kind of Science.,https://medium.com/@henk.celcius/a-new-kind-of-science-kind-of-269b185ac6?source=tag_archive---------2-----------------------,"Wolfram,Computation,Cellular Automata,Neural Networks,Mathematics","In 2002 Stephen Wolfram published his 1197 page book called “A New Kind of Science” which, generously, is completely available online here and from which we took some screenshots for this article.Stephen Wolfram’s 1197 page thick book, published in 2002.It’s 2020 now. So in retrospect, let’s shed a new light on this book. Did it influence or even revolutionize science? Here is my summary.1. Complexity From SimplicityIn the book, Wolfram mainly proposes and defends the thesis that, with very simple rules, simple programs running those rules, a lot of visual patterns can be generated, some of them showing high complexity. To know if this is true, it is important to define simple and to define complexity. We’ll come to that.However, for best understanding of context, we start with the examples from the book Wolfram calls crucial.1.1 Wolfram’s Computational ExperimentsThe first example Wolfram gives is one which he has run when he was 12 years old, while clearly inquisitive already, which occurred in 1959+12=1971.The ‘computationally generative system’-setup is that we create a vector of a certain number of squares, where each square is either black or white. This vector represents the initial condition or first generation. Then a ‘simple program’ will take such a generation as input and using a fixed rule, will generate the next generation, which is a vector of the same length. The fixed rule is always of the type that the color of each square in the vector depends on the color of the squares in the previous vector that are in the immediate neighbourhood. So there is only local influence. It turns out that this is already enough to generate a variation of patterns in the results.1.1.1 Experiment 0: ‘Nothing’ ResultsThe zero-th experiment he, I think added retroactively, tested was the rule, “a square in generation n+1 becomes black if itself or either neighbour was black in generation n”.Quite obviously, even without executing the computer program, one can imagine that this leads to spreading of black squares and never is a white square generated. So we get a black pyramidal structure as in the picture below.The 0th experiment: The rule generates a black pyramid without any interesting structure.The result is not very exciting. What happens if we change the generative rule just a bit?1.1.2 Experiment 1: Periodicity ResultsThe second rule is indicated in the below picture on the right and the result is given on the left.The 1st experiment: The rule generates a Chessboard PatternThis may be surprising or not to people. If one reads the rule itself “cell gets black if either of its neighbours were black”, “cell gets white if both its neighbours were white”, one understands that this already encodes the tendency for the same color to spread according to diagonals. Understanding that may take away ‘the magic’ for some. It will please the others, I think, essentially because they capture that a very simple exact rule can generate a relatively complex structure; the alteration of black and white.1.1.3 Experiment 2: Self-Similarity ResultsWolfram then shows an experiment with exactly the same setup but just a slightly different fixed rule, where the modification in the rule means that two black neighbours generate a white square in the next generation i.o a black one in the previous experiment, all else being equal. Obviously that will generate fewer black squares than the previous experiment for given triangle depth. The resulting figure is shown below.The 2nd experiment: The rule generates a Pattern that has Self Similarity like a Fractal hasThis picture displays an object property called self similarity. This is defined roughly as that an object has similar structure from afar as when one zooms in on some parts of it. (One could argue that the previous picture possesses the same property, but it would be self-similarity of less complex, smaller structures, so it is less obvious there.)This pattern in the second experiment will be surprising more people than the result of the first experiment, because it is just harder to predict, because (1) the rule is somewhat more complex and (2) the result is a lot more complex. That makes it more surprising and so also more interesting. One could also call the result more beautiful, and hence more satisfying, but that’s of course subjective. ¹1.1.4 Experiment 3: Apparent/True PseudoRandomness ResultsA further Wolfram experiment leads to a new feature in the result: apparent randomness.Generating apparent randomnessIt turns out that, after some 2780 steps a fairly simple repetitive structure emerges, as one can see in the following two pictures.More iterationsEven more iterationsWolfram also gives examples of programs that generate structures without discernible periodicity at all.Whether (a bit of) randomness is more beautiful than recognisable periodicity is subjective, but it certainly adds variation to regularity and so seems to add complexity.²1.1.5 Are you Surprised?Are the results of the experiments of Wolfram mentioned here surprising or not? The black pyramid is not surprising. The chess-board pattern is not either, since from the rule itself it’s easy to predict. The self-similar pattern is harder to predict, so that’s quite surprising. Even more unpredictable is the apparent randomness from the third experiment.1. 2 Non-Wolfram Computational ExperimentsWolfram does not mention experiments performed by others. So what if we ask the somewhat more general questions: can one generate complex pattern from simpler patterns? Can we come up with some of ourselves or from others?1.2.1 Overlapping Equidistant Lines/Concentric Circles Generate a Surprising Moiré PatternWhen I was 16 and started programming, one of the first programs I cooked up was a graphical one where you draw straight lines with varying slope over each other. In the area where these lines cross a certain surprising pattern could be detected.Similarly, as demonstrated on this wikipedia page, two sets of lines overlapping each other or two sets of concentric circles with increasing radius overlapping each other can generate Moiré patterns.Two sets of concentric circles overlapping generates Moiré patterns: animation.Two sets of collinear lines overlapping generate curved patterns: snapshot. Note that there is even an extra dynamic pattern occurring in the center of this figure when your scroll it up and down, due to the interaction with the pixel resolution of your screen.One could consider this also as two simple patterns generating complex patterns. These are certainly hard to predict, unless one has seen this before.Remarkably or not, in magnetic fields, so ‘in nature’, the field lines occur along exactly the same pattern.Magnetic field lines between two opposite point charges.1.2.2 Unsurprising Self-Similarity: The Koch CurveSelf Similarity is an interesting property to explore in itself. Digging a bit into it, outside of Wolframs book, there is a more accurate definition of it on Wikipedia. More captivating than the definitions are the examples mentioned there, because one discovers that they come in two kinds. The ones where the definition of the rules already contain self-similarity and the ones where self-similarity of the result is non-obvious or in other words, surprising.An example of the first category is the Koch curve, after the Swede Helge von Koch (1970–1924). This curve’s constructive definition is also expressed in terms of its generations. The Koch curve of the initial generation is just a line segment of finite length. The next generation is constructed/computed from the previous, by dividing each existing segment in the previous generation in three equal parts, and only for the middle part, replace the segment with a regular triangle of which the base is the replaced segment, then leave out that base segment. Visually, this leads to the following first three generations.Iterative construction of the three first generations towards the Koch curveThe following animated GIF from wikipedia shows an infinite amount of generations, that is, if you would have infinite time to watch it.Apart from dizzifying, this may seem ‘magic’ to some. In fact, the self similarity should not surprise you, once you realise that it is already ‘obviously’ present in the definition of the curve. It was ‘set-up’ to be self similar. It was constructed / invented to be self-similar.This is, at least as far as I see, not the case in the next type of structures.1.2.3 Surprising Self-Similarity: The Mandelbrot SetAn example of the surprising category are pictures generated based on the Mandelbrot-set. For our argument, it is of course important to understand how the rule assigning a color to a pixel in the picture is defined at its base.Wikipedia defines the Mandelbrot-set as the collection of complex numbers c for which the iterative mapping from complex number z to complex number f_c(0), to f_c(f_c(0)), f_c(f_c(f_c(0))), … does not diverge to infinity.The function f_c is not just an arbitrary one, but is defined as the ‘very simple’ f_c(z) = z²+c.The practical way to calculate and show the Mandelbrot set and the surrounding pixels not being part of it, is to select a rectangle in the complex plane, (say from c=x + iy with -1≤ x ≤+1 and -1≤y≤+1, representing x,y in the generated picture) and for each pixel (x,y), apply the function z1= f_c(0), z2 = f_c(z1), z3=f_c(z2) until the a |zi|=sqrt(x²+y²), measuring the distance of zi to (0,0) in the complex plane, for some i can be considered diverging, so larger than a certain threshold, say 100 or so. For each c, one then assigns a color to c that depends on the number i at which zi first got outside the radius 100 circle around the origin. When a chosen, fixed maximum number of iterations is reached for a certain c without divergence, the pixel is part of the Mandelbrot set and gets assigned the ‘color black’.Clearly, there is no self similarity directly imposed in this iterative procedure to construct it or should we at least say that, it is not clear that self-similarity is directly imposed in the formulation.Yet, consider the following resulting picture, and what happens when we zoom in to explore substructures…As a GIF obtained from Simpsons contributor at English Wikipedia — Transferred from en.wikipedia to Commons by Franklin.vp using CommonsHelper., Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=9277589Colorful Mandelbrot set zoom-in by an animated GIF. Note that it gets shaky in the end, likely due to accuracy problems due to very small numbers and then restarts at the beginning.or as a youtube videoopen youtube-video in a new browser tabor for another rendering, including some entertaining music :)open youtube-video in a new browser tabClearly self-similarity is omnipresent. The sub-structures occurring on all levels of magnification are also extremely complex.Isn’t it surprising that all this complexity gets generated from a very simple rule, the subsequent mapping starting at (0,0) with a function f_c(z)=z²+c and counting how many iterations are needed for divergence?Lacking to see exactly where the rich structure comes from, one gets a feeling that it cannot be planned for by the human who defined the generator, and so, ‘is just present in nature itself’. In other words, the generated pattern is a discovery, not an invention.Wikipedia gives some history of the Mandelbrot setThe Mandelbrot set has its origin in complex dynamics, a field first investigated by the French mathematicians Pierre Fatou and Gaston Julia at the beginning of the 20th century. This fractal was first defined and drawn in 1978 by Robert W. Brooks and Peter Matelski as part of a study of Kleinian groups.[2] On 1 March 1980, at IBM’s Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York, Benoit Mandelbrot first saw a visualization of the set.[3]It ends the introduction on the set with:The Mandelbrot set has become popular outside mathematics both for its aesthetic appeal and as an example of a complex structure arising from the application of simple rules. It is one of the best-known examples of mathematical visualization and mathematical beauty.That high complexity can arise from very simple rules is the number one message the book “A New Kind of Science” wants to drive home, using 100s of examples from Wolfram himself. To me the Mandelbrot set is a much better example of generation of complexity from simple rules. It is therefore quite remarkable that Wolfram’s first mention of it is on page 899 in the (foot)note part of the book.³ ⁴2 Nature Shows Complexity and How Can Science Best Describe/Predict it?The chapter 7 of Wolfram’s NKS book, many examples of complexity present in nature are given. The first and a very convincing is about typical forms of growing snowflakes. It’s given in the figure below.The growth of typical forms of snowflakes.This picture directly convinces that complexity in terms of structure, periodicity and self-similarity are all present. It poses some questions.Why are snowflakes hexagonally structured?Why are they alternating on a very local level between ice and no ice?Why are snowflakes so symmetric? In other words, how does one arm of the 6 know to behave in the same way as the others? ⁵Hexagonality is due to the crystal structure of ice. Wolfram answers the second question by “the major effect responsible for this is that whenever a piece of ice is added to the snowflake, there is some heat released, which then tends to inhibit the formation of other pieces of ice nearby.” This is a qualitative answer and traditional science would normally take a quantitative approach by for example presenting a (set of coupled) partial differential equation(s) to model this more accurately. Apart from being a more accurate description of a phenomenon, the advantage of using the classical analytical approach is also that computers and software libraries directly allow one to simulate the phenomenon. While differential equations are only descriptive and by themselves they do not contain a recipe to simulate, nowadays a practical constructive recipe directly follows from it.Wolfram does not mention this. That’s weird because he is the main architect of the Mathematica package which amongst many other things is able to do exactly that: take a differential equation and solve it, which ends up with showing an example simulation of the phenomenon.Wolfram does mention that with his approach of cellular automata a visual result close to what is observed in nature can be generated. He shows convincing results of that as in the picture below.One could argue that while the result is ‘close’ by showing similar but not identical structures, it does not prove that the process is the same as taken by nature.With the traditional approach to science via differential equations, one only has to take the new step of accurately describing the new studied phenomenon in an equation, based on possibly new but potentially already discovered physics, then the constructive recipe just rolls out via equation solving software libraries.As an example of a very condensed and powerful descriptive model in physics, consider the below Maxwell’s equations of magnetism.Maxwell equations in differential form on electric and magnetic fields.With this differential model, the complete field, so the strength and direction of the magnetic force, in each point can be derived. This works with standard calculus. I also happily solved countless exercises in my first engineering education years by integration over surfaces or volumes. These equations are also the basis of numerical software libraries like Magpylib by which computations of E and B for much larger or more complex settings can be automatically performed.On the other hand, with the Wolfram cellular automata approach, one will formulate a certainly new ‘simple rule’, then try out and see if this gives results that are similar. If not, the ‘simple rule’ can just (all too?) quickly be altered. I believe there is a danger there, corresponding to the danger of overfitting and as such getting results alike to what nature produces without actually catching the essence of the process present in nature. Also, once a certain rule seems to give a nature-like result for a certain setting, will it also give a nature-like result for another setting? How should the rule be changed to adapt to a setting? Or not at all? In other words, does it have predictive power apart from for the possibly overfitted first experiment?One may say that this does not matter if the results resemble what nature creates. So it depends if one raises the deeper question of truth (Does nature really behave like this?) versus the more superficial question of utility (Can I just get nature-like pictures?). I think the first question is the one science is supposed to answer. So to me, A New Kind of Science looks like a Lesser Kind of Science.3 Could Simple Programs form the Basis of Complexity found in Nature?Would nature use ‘simple programs’ to come up with the complex structures that we see in plants and animals and also in inanimate objects around us?Wolfram does no claim that when he presents an artificial automata generated picture which looks alike some structure in nature that nature actually does the same computation.He does formulate a more careful version of this claim, which he calls the ‘principle of computational equivalence’. In Wolfram’s words: “What the Principle of Computational Equivalence says is that above an extremely low threshold, all processes correspond to computations of equivalent sophistication.” Even though he spends many pages on this, I still find this a very vague claim, sounding more like a tautology.4. My ConclusionMy conclusion about New Kind of Science is this.4.1 Is it New?Yes, it was. The kind and scope of cellular (and other) automata that Wolfram describes were quite new when published in 2002. But quite some earlier or simultaneous discoveries like the Game of Life by Conway and the Mandelbrot set were already known, very relevant and quite downplayed in the book.4.2 Is it Science?In the traditional method of science, one first aims to describe a phenomenon by a compact concise descriptive model, most often as a type of (possibly coupled) equation(s). Then a widely accepted, and by others encoded in software, process follows to perform a simulation with this/these equation(s) as input. This corresponds to the scientific method, where first a hypothesis is formulated, without checking yet what the results would be, and only after careful consideration of the descriptive model, then the outcome with the generative recipe is produced and checked. One typically has one program with the same rules and should be able to predict results from nature by changing only initial conditions.In the Wolfram proposed approach with cellular (or other) automata of simple programs, there is just one step essentially, where, for given initial conditions, one can manipulate and tune the rule without constraints to just give the desired results. This corresponds to a less general method than in classical science.In both approaches, trial-and-error iterations not forbidden, but I think the split between a descriptive and constructive process of the traditional approach to science gives a higher chance of getting close to the process nature follows than Wolfram’s approach.But well, it may just be a matter of taste or habit.Is it science? … Kind of. It depends on what one calls science. (see: “Is it Useful” below.)4.3 Is it Wolfram’s?Stephen Wolfram is without a doubt a brilliant mathematician and scientist. He also clearly worked extremely hard, with the Wolfram team he lead, to first construct the software package “Mathematica” and then, based on that, to produce the monumental volume NKS is. However, at times he downplays contributions of others to the field of cellular automata. In one footnote, on page 849 called “Clarity and Modesty”, he even writes […] “Perhaps I might avoid some criticism by a greater display of modesty, but the cost would be a drastic reduction in clarity.” I don’t think there needs to be a trade-of here, and certainly not a drastic one.4.4 Is it Useful?Did the book ‘New Kind of Science’ have impact from 2002 to 2020?It would be most informative to see if Wolfram himself has an opinion on that. And indeed he has written elaborately about this online here.Summarised, I think we can say that in the last 10 and certainly the last 5 years, genetic algorithms and especially neural networks have been very successful. This is for example demonstrated in the 2016 victory of Deepmind’s alpha-go on the best human players of the game Go and the DARPA autonomous driving contests (2004–2018). The latter has by now also given rise to a whole new industry.However, I would attribute the success of that technology to the learning capacity of those systems, which comes from training them on existing input-output sets and then results in predictive capacities of outputs on new similar inputs. This process nor capacity is present in Wolfram’s cellular automata as presented in NKS.Wolfram claimed in 2015 “But to me the success of today’s neural nets is a spectacular endorsement of the power of the computational universe, and another validation of the ideas of A New Kind of Science. Because it shows that out in the computational universe, away from the constraints of explicitly building systems whose detailed behavior one can foresee, there are immediately all sorts of rich and useful things to be found.”.I has become clear that it’s indeed true that we do not need to restrict ourselves to classical science to have useful engineering applications, with the footnote that with the inherent lower understanding about how these models work internally (coming from the training and possible overfitting methods) we have a higher risk at predicting outcomes that do not materialise in nature. To decide whether these predictive methods can be used or not, it depends on the level of criticality and whether the models are trained on outlier events if these events can occur in practice.So George Box’s aphorism comes to mind here.All models are wrong but some are useful.4.5 What’s Interesting about the Book?NKS certainly convinces that simple programs can lead to beautiful pictures containing a lot of surprising structure. So it certainly has artistic and some philosophical value. The book can also be seen as a catalogue of programs with some parallels to a naturalist reference, which is a nice idea in itself. I am less convinced it contributes a new method that can be used in theoretical science. For engineering applications recent history has confirmed that the neural networks rather than the cellular automata are most useful because of their ability to learn.FootnotesInteresting side questions here are if the subjective experience of beauty has more to do with the subjective surprise or feeling of discovering something new than with the objective structure in the picture itself. I think it’s about both or even the connection between both. And indeed, from this, one wonders if nature would somehow also ‘computationally work’ like this.Note that in information theory, maximum disorder, also called maximum entropy (which, according to the second law of Thermodynamics, is what in nature any closed system ultimately evolves to), is defined as the case where there is the least possible information at all about what is going to happen next. More formally, in terms of exclusive events e out of a set E of N events, where each e will occur with a probability p(e), the missing information H(E) can be defined as:Missing information formulaIt can be proven via derivation of the Lagrangian (see e.g. here) that this is maximised when P(e)=P(e’) for all event pairs (e,e’) in ExE. This implies P(e) = 1/N. This proves that all events being equally likely to happen corresponds to maximum randomness.3. Unsurprising versus Surprising Structure: It’s Subjective.The distinction between what is surprising and what is not depends on the observer’s knowledge and understanding an so is certainly subjective. Once more knowledge is acquired (e.g. with the Koch curve), something that was surprising may become logical in the sense that one understands what causes it (giving satisfaction by the feeling of having discovered a new relation) and become interesting but stop being surprising.If one looks at the animated zooms of the Mandelbrot set, at least to me, it is still incredible that so much structure keeps coming up from ‘just z²+c’. So one keeps wondering why. The animation keeps surprising me.4. At the outset we said that Wolfram claims that simple programs can produce complex patterns. It’s quite clear that all the rules presented here and also in the book are quite simple. The complexity found in the output pictures is of different levels. From blandness (a black pyramid), to periodicity (a chess board pattern pyramid) to self-similarity (pyramids containing sub-pyramids, koch curves and fractals). We have tried to demonstrate that this is only interesting to the degree that it remains surprising even after closer inspection.So to me, Wolfram’s main thesis should be understood in the sense that the ratio of complexity in the output over the complexity in the input is surprising and interesting when high. I still find this ratio the highest in fractals like the Mandelbrot sets. It seems to reveal more about ‘nature’ than Wolframs examples. I think this is also why in the 1980s so many people got excited about it when they became part of the popular science press.5. Why are snowflakes so highly symmetric? In other words, how does each arm of the 6 know to behave in the same way as the others? ⁵ This Scientific American article gives a qualitative answer, indicating that the symmetry follows from minimisation of energy in the structure, which balances maximisation of attracting forces and minimization of repelling forces. So surely one arm does not actively know about the others, but given certain homogeneous temperature and humidity conditions, then via the forces, it seems that when one arm starts forming in one way, the other arms have no choice anymore but to do the same. The sheer variety of snowflake structures is a consequence of the large variation of these conditions from high to low altitude across different snowflake trajectories through our atmosphere.Appendix: Further Nature vs. Computational Experiment SimilaritiesTo show that the scope of the book is not only about snowflakes, here are some more examples from the book. On page 385 of NKS, Wolfram gives beautiful examples of periodic or self-similar structures found in nature at many different scales.He then produces similar structures artificially with his automata like these ones on page 400.Growing structures with automata that end up looking like trees.The structures are quite alike the ones in row 3, column 3 and 4 of the pictures gotten from nature above and certainly arty. But does it capture anything that would ‘happen’ in nature or is the similarity accidental? Not sure… Is it useful for science? I am not so convinced.More examples from chapter 7 concern the breaking of materials, fluid flows, 2D pigment structures and 3D shapes in biology and even financial systems.Peter Sels, August 7th 2020.

"Omniscience As Math, Then Again As A Horse",https://medium.com/@pabwota/omniscience-as-math-then-again-as-a-horse-58ad9849703b?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"Religion,Mathematics,Animals,Ideas","Photo by Jeremy Thomas on UnsplashI once had a man approach me at a train station under the pretense of completing a survey for a student project. Carefully, as if martially trained to do so, he steered the conversation to the subject of Jesus. He was a member of a multinational church founded in South Korea that believed Christ had already returned, lived a full life, and died sometime in the 1990s. I’ve since lost the brightly colored information card he gave me.The fake surveyor at the station was not the first to pitch me a religion. I — like many others reared by West African immigrants who followed the global trails of Charismatic Christianity — have heard weekly pitches for as long as I can remember. I’ve also been fortunate enough to be engaged by a self-proclaimed omnitheist with an aptitude for moon cycles and live theater, a foul-mouthed Wiccan with bad fashion sense, and a practicing Muslim with a passion for sneakers. The latter is a dear friend of mine who recently helped me put an idea into words.Omniscience As MathThe missionary says: “ I believe that there is a God who is all-powerful, all-seeing, and all-knowing. He/She/They know better than I do and they have a plan!” The missionary makes sure to emphasize that the ways of God are mysterious, Man cannot possibly comprehend the cosmic thoughts of God. God knows more and God knows better.I interpret the missionary’s statement like so: For every Problem x, the God Thought function produces a Solution y that is always “better” than the Solution y produced by the Thought function. Given that I am a particularly rotten math student, my thinking is best illustrated by the graph below:We do not know how much better the Solution y produced by God Thought is than that produced by Thought. The unknown variable, h, on the graph is the difference between God Thought and Thought. Assigned to it is the value produced when immortality is multiplied by cosmic power. It is what separates the great planetary mind of God from the beast-derived of man’s. Call it whatever you want, some have chosen to call it “holiness” so I have labeled it h.Allow me to clarify something: I am not attempting to boil down centuries of reflection on the universe and the nature of being into a single graph. I cannot imagine the celestial-sized cojones it would take to even think oneself capable of such a feat. I am using math as a metaphorical device to outline a critique that has made all of my commitments to religiosity short-lived. Bear with me if I botch bending basic functions into a metaphor.The Thought function runs 24/7 in the minds of fragile mortals like myself. I employ Thought when deciding my daily outfits, weighing the odds of beating a red traffic light, or abstaining from orchestrating a bank heist. In assessing each Problem, given my mortality and lack of cosmic power, Thought runs the risk of producing a Solution that is less than ideal. I could end up in a car crash, die in a shoot-out with police at TD Bank, or — the worst possible outcome — wear stripes with dots. The God Thought function never runs this risk, according to the missionary, it would produce a Solution that saves me from a fender bender, a fatal situation, and a bad fashion day every time. But how does one access the pristine God Thought function? The missionary is quick to present volumes of ancient texts, claiming that they hold the key to executing God Thought.Here is where the conflict arises. Take the recommendation for child-rearing given in one ancient text, Leviticus Chapter 20, verse 9:For anyone who curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death; he has cursed his father or his mother; his blood is upon him.The Problem: a rebellious, dishonorable child.The Solution produced by the God Thought function: stone your child to death.This Solution applies stress to the h variable on the graph. For both functions to stay true to their definition, the Solution of stoning a child to death for their rebellion must be inherently better than any possible Solution produced by Thought. Many parents and child psychologists, whose minds operate with the Thought function, would argue that there are responses to a troublesome child that are much better than stoning. To be completely fair, theologians suggest that the behavior referenced in Leviticus was likely extreme and dangerous to society, a summary of this perspective can be found here.If stoning children for being rebellious is better than all other options, then I imagine the TV show “Supernanny” would have much bloodier episodes. But if we mortals, using our imperfect Thought function, have found solutions to dealing with children that have produced more favorable outcomes (i.e. reformed behavior, fewer dead children), the prior Solution produced by God Thought is not better. If this is the case, then the definition of God Thought as presented by the missionary is incorrect.As I mentioned before, I pieced together this graph with the help of my friend, the Muslim sneaker-head. He is a person I admire for his willingness to confront and wrestle with difficult aspects of his faith. His questions and comments during the afternoon walk that formulated this critique generated a less convoluted version.Omniscience As A HorseThe missionary approaches. In this metaphor we are positioned near the edges of a race track. I am a betting man, I play dice with Death and gamble away Life’s fortunes. The missionary points to the track and says: “There, that’s the one you want to bet your future on.” Imagine that he points to a horse that looks like this:Photo by Bruno Thethe on UnsplashThis is God Thought. Strong, fully-grown, and beautiful. In the words of Last Week Tonight’s John Oliver: “a super f*ckable horse”. God Thought knows this track, the missionary assures me, my bets are better placed on its speed and power. I am warned to steer clear of betting on this little guy:Photo by Francesco Ungaro on UnsplashThis is Thought. Smaller, less developed, and in no way ready for the cover of Equus Magazine. I’m told that if I bet on this poor sap it would be a waste of Life’s fortunes and I will be left barren and broke. I am a betting man, I want the most out of what Life has given me.This is probably a good point to mention that the two horses race on the flow of time.A Big Bang and the horses are off! The first couple million years are a bit of a blur, I believe the slow-motion cameras were obscured by all the volcanic ash. Sometime around 5000 BC the difference between the two horses becomes clearer, and the missionary seems to have been right on the money! God Thought is completely dominating the race, Thought just cannot keep up with its power and speed. Round and round the track they go, blazing through the rise and fall of human civilizations with Thought struggling to keep up.However, something magical has been happening during this race through the centuries. Thought, who began the race as a small, frail creature gets a bit bigger with each lap. The growth is small at first as Thought figures out novel immigration techniques in Mesopotamia, but a couple of centuries and scientific leaps later:Photo from The Vet ExpertWell DAMN!Horse puberty hits Thought like a truck. Thought runs the track faster, and faster, and faster. A couple of laps later and Thought is neck and neck with God Thought. God Thought, all these centuries later, has remained unchanged and has shaved zero seconds off its race time. Thought runs the track so fast it makes God Thought look as though it were standing still. The missionary says I should still bet on God Thought.Death has come to collect.Clarifications & ConclusionThe models I have presented are incomplete, there are some underlying assumptions in their structure that cannot be ignored.Firstly, the example I used in the math metaphor was one from the Bible, the focal text in Christian theology. In conversation, my Muslim friend was quick to point out that the theological scope of the presented framework, the difference between God Thought and Thought as well as their relationships with the variable h, is not clearly defined. Applying them to Christianity’s siblings, Islam and Judaism, is a simpler feat than doing so with religions arising from different traditions (e.g. Hinduism, Buddhism).Secondly, the horse racing metaphor is more underdeveloped than that of the math model. The relationship between the horses’ speed and power to time was not fully fleshed out, therefore the fact that Horse A goes faster than Horse B doesn’t really have meaning. I believe that the metaphor still does the work of communicating a message similar to that of the math model, but its internal mechanics need to be tightened up.This was an attempt to summarize the fruits borne of a small piece of a two-year-long conversation between friends of different religious backgrounds. I imagine I will revise these models many times in my life. Towards the end of our walk together, my friend suggested that we, as a species, have not yet figured out God Thought. Our knowledge of Thought is not the issue, we know it intimately, it impresses upon us its abundance of knowledge while we respond with our lack of knowledge. God Thought has proven to be elusive and our approximations of it wither with time. “You know at the end of the day, everybody could be wrong,” my friend says.Written byPerry Asibey-BonsuIndie writer.

"<strong class=""cb"">An end-to-end guide to understand the math behind XGBoost</strong>",https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/an-end-to-end-guide-to-understand-the-math-behind-xgboost-fa0d1665bb7f?source=tag_archive---------4-----------------------,"Xgboost,Ensemble Learning,Machine Learning,Mathematics","Ever since its introduction in 2014, XGBoost has been lauded as the holy grail of Kaggle competitions. From predicting ad click through rates to classifying high energy physics events, XGBoost has proved its mettle in terms of performance — and speed. In 2016, Tianqi Chen, one of the co-creators of XGBoost, reported that the innovative system features and algorithmic optimizations in XGBoost have rendered it 10 times faster than most sought after machine learning solutions. The beauty of this powerful algorithm lies in its scalability, which drives fast learning through parallel and distributed computing and offers efficient memory usage. No wonder, CERN recognized it as the best approach to classify signals from the Large Hadron Collider. This particular challenge posed by CERN required a solution that would be scalable to process data being generated at the rate of 3 petabytes per year and effectively distinguish an extremely rare signal from background noises in a complex physical process. XGBoost emerged as the most useful, straightforward and robust solution.Why ensemble learning?XGBoost is an ensemble learning method. Sometimes, it may not be sufficient to rely upon the results of just one machine learning model. Ensemble learning offers a systematic solution to combine the predictive power of multiple learners. The resultant is a single model which gives the aggregated output from several models. The models, also known as base learners, that form the ensemble could be either of the same learning algorithm or different learning algorithms. Bagging and boosting are two widely used ensemble learners. Though these two techniques could be used with several statistical models, the most predominant usage has been with decision trees.Bagging:While decision trees are one of the most easily interpretable models, they exhibit highly variable behavior. Consider a single training dataset being randomly split into two parts. Now, let’s use each of this split data to train a decision tree to obtain two models. When both these models are fit, they would yield different results. For exhibiting such behaviour, decision tree is said to be associated with high variance. Bagging or boosting aggregation helps to reduce the variance in any learner. Several decision trees which are generated in parallel form the base learners of bagging technique. Data sampled with replacement is fed to these learners for training. The final prediction is the averaged output from all the learners.Boosting:In boosting, the trees are built sequentially such that each subsequent tree aims to reduce the errors of the previous tree. Each tree learns from its predecessors and updates the residual errors. Hence, the tree grown next in the sequence will learn from an updated version of the data.The base learners in boosting are weak learners in which the bias is high, and the predictive power is just a tad better than random guessing. Each of these weak learners contributes some information vital for prediction, enabling boosting technique to produce a strong learner by effectively combining these weak learners. The final strong learner modelled brings down both bias and variance. In contrary to bagging techniques like Random Forest, in which trees are grown to the maximum extent, boosting makes use of trees with fewer splits. Such small trees which are not very deep are highly interpretable. Parameters like the number of trees or iterations, the rate at which the gradient boosting learns and the depth of the tree could be optimally selected through validation techniques like k-fold cross validation. Having a large number of trees might lead to overfitting. So, it is necessary to carefully choose the stopping criteria for boosting.Boosting consists of three simple steps:· An initial model F0 is defined to predict the target variable y. This model will be associated with a residual (y — F0).· A new model h1 is fit to the residuals from the previous step.· Now, F0 and h1 are combined to give F1, the boosted version of F0. The mean squared error from F1 will be lower than that from F0.F1(x) <- F0(x) + h1(x)To improve the performance of F1, we could model after the residuals of F1 and create a new model F2.F2(x) <- F1(x) + h2(x)This can be done for ‘m’ iterations, until residuals have been minimized as much as possible.Fm(x) <- Fm-1(x) + hm(x)Here, the additive learners do not disturb the functions created in the previous steps. Instead, they impart information of their own to bring down errors.Demonstrating the Potential of Boosting:Consider the following data where the predictor is the years of experience and target variable is the salary in thousand dollars. Using regression trees as base learners, we can create a model to predict the target. For the sake of simplicity, we can choose square loss as our loss function and our objective would be to minimize square error.We can use the residuals from F0(x) to create h1(x). h1(x) will be a regression tree which will try and reduce the residuals from the previous step. The output of h1(x) won’t be a prediction of y; instead, it will help predicting the successive function F1(x) which will bring down the residuals.The additive model h1(x) computes the mean of the residuals (y — F0) at each leaf of the tree. The boosted function F1(x) is obtained by summing F0(x) and h1(x). This way h1(x) learns from the residuals of F0(x) and suppresses it in F1(x).This can be repeated for 2 more iterations to compute h2(x) and h3(x). Each of these additive learners hm(x) will make use of the residuals from the preceding function Fm-1(x).The MSEs for F0(x), F1(x) and F2(x) are 875, 692 and 540. It is amazing how these simple weak learners bring a huge reduction in error.It is seen that each learner hm(x) is trained on the residuals. All the additive learners in boosting are modelled after the residual errors at each step. Intuitively, it could be observed that the boosting learners make use of the patterns in residual errors. At the stage where maximum accuracy is reached by boosting, the residuals appear to be randomly distributed without any pattern.Plots of Fn (odd panels) and hn (even panels)Using gradient descent for optimizing the loss functionIn the case discussed above, MSE was the loss function. The mean minimized the error here. When MAE (mean absolute error) is the loss function, the median would be used as F0(x) to initialize the model. A unit change in y would cause a unit change in MAE as well. For MSE, the change observed would be roughly exponential. Instead of fitting hm(x) on the residuals, fitting on the gradient of loss function or the step along which loss occurs would make this process generic and applicable across all loss functions.Gradient descent helps us minimize any differentiable function. Earlier, the regression tree for hm(x) predicted the mean residual at each terminal node of the tree. In gradient boosting, the average gradient component would be computed. For each node, there is a factor γ with which hm(x) is multiplied. This accounts for the difference in impact of each branch of the split. Gradient boosting helps in predicting the optimal gradient for the additive model, unlike classical gradient descent techniques which reduce error in the output at each iteration.Unique features of XGBoostXGBoost is a popular implementation of gradient boosting. Let’s discuss some features of XGBoost that make it so interesting.· Regularization: XGBoost has an option to penalize complex models through both L1 and L2 regularization. Regularization helps preventing overfitting.· Handling sparse data: Missing values or data processing steps like one hot encoding make data sparse. XGBoost incorporates a sparsity-aware split finding algorithm to handle different types of sparsity patterns in data.· Weighted quantile sketch: Most existing tree based algorithms can find the split points when the data points are of equal weights using quantile sketch algorithm. However, they are not equipped to handle weighted data. XGBoost has a distributed weighted quantile sketch algorithm to effectively handle weighted data.· Block structure for parallel learning: For a faster computing, XGBoost can make use of multiple cores on the CPU. This is possible because of a block structure in its system design. Data is sorted and stored in in-memory units called blocks. Unlike other algorithms, this enables the data layout to be reused by subsequent iterations, instead of computing it again. This feature also serves useful for steps like split finding and column subsampling.· Cache awareness: In XGBoost, non-continuous memory access is required to get the gradient statistics by row index. Hence, XGBoost has been designed to make optimal use of hardware. This is done by allocating internal buffers in each thread, where the gradient statistics can be stored.· Out-of-core computing: This feature optimizes the available disk space and maximizes its usage when handling huge datasets that do not fit into memory.Indium Software has implemented XGBoost for solving classification problems in various industries. For example, we used XGBoost to classify students who were prone to dropout/failure/withdrawal from a class wherein the data of interest was very rare. As expected, it outdid all the other algorithms in terms of accuracy. We have also used it in various text classification problems.

The journey of a thousand year old problem,https://medium.com/@maleehakhawaja/the-journey-of-a-thousand-year-old-problem-cd41449f66aa?source=tag_archive---------5-----------------------,"Mathematics,Number Theory,Fibonacci,Fermat","There are many problems in Number Theory that can be easily understood, even by non-experts, but not so easily solved. Having been around for more than a thousand years, and still unsolved in the present day, The Congruent Number Problem is one example of such a problem.The First FormulationAn anonymous Arab manuscript, dated before the year 972, posed the following challenge:“Let n be a positive whole number. Find a rational number x for which x²+n and x²-n are both rational squares.”If such an x exists, then n is said to be a congruent number. The problem of determining whether any given n is a congruent number is called the Congruent Number Problem.(A rational number is a number that can be written as a fraction, where the numerator and denominator are whole numbers. A rational square is the square of a rational number.)OriginsSince the author of this manuscript has never been confirmed, it is natural to question where this problem originated from.Diophantus of Alexandria (Source: https://www.famousmathematicians.net/diophantus/)Going back to the 3rd Century, it is known that Diophantus of Alexandria, a Greek mathematician, worked on problems of a similar nature. However, Diophantus’ work was translated into Arabic into 998 — it cannot be that the Arabs took this problem from Diophantus directly. The Hindu mathematicians at the time were very familiar with the work of Diophantus. It is, therefore, entirely possible that the Arabs derived this problem from Diophantus via the Hindus.Turning to TrianglesIn the 10th century, the Arab mathematician, Mohammed Ben Alhocain converted this problem into one of triangles:n is a congruent number if there is a rational right angle triangle with area n.The equivalence of these two formulations requires some calculations and substitutions — interested readers are referred to Theorem 3.1 here.A rational right angle triangle is a right angle triangle where all side lengths are rational numbers. For a rational right angle triangle, with side lengths x, y, z, this gives rise to the following pair of simultaneous equations:Why? The first equation is the statement of Pythagoras’ Theorem. The second equation immediately follows from the formula for the area of a triangle.Enter FibonacciSkipping ahead to the 12th century, the Italian mathematician, Fibonacci was challenged to find whether 5 is a congruent number. Going back to the first formulation of the problem, Fibonacci found the following:i.e. He spotted that if 5 is added or subtracted from the square of 41/12 (a rational number) then this gives rise to the square of a rational number. Therefore, 5 is a congruent number.Leonardo Pisano Bigollo or Fibonacci (Source:https://www.famousmathematicians.net/?s=Fibonacci)This was not his only contribution to the problem. Fibonacci conjectured (but didn’t prove) that a square can’t be a congruent number. (This would mean that any square number can not be the area of a rational right triangle!)Enter FermatIn the 17th century, the (part-time) French mathematician and lawyer, Pierre de Fermat proved that a square can not be a congruent number. (In fact, this is one of his only recorded proofs).Pierre De Fermat (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_de_Fermat)Congruent numbers and curvesTill now, we have seen two formulations of the Congruent Number Problem — a purely arithmetic one and one involving the area of a right angle triangle.There is another formulation involving the following ‘one-to-one’ correspondence:Let’s clarify what a one-to-one correspondence means. In this context, if there is a rational right angle triangle with area n (i.e. n is a congruent number) then this corresponds to a rational point on the curve y²=x³ - n²x (where x and y are rational numbers and y doesn’t equal 0). There is also a converse correspondence.(There is an explicit correspondence — interested readers are referred to Theorem 4.1 here.)Therefore, the Congruent Number Problem is now a problem of finding points on a curve. The below graphic shows a snippet of the curve in question (for each n between 0 and 50).Tunnell’s Theorem and the BSD ConjectureIn 1983, Tunnell made a significant breakthrough with this problem. Let n be a positive (square-free) integer and let f(n) be the following set:In words — this is the set of all such triples (x, y, z), where x, y, z are whole numbers, satisfying the equation x²+2y²+8z² = n. The set g(n) is defined in a similar fashion below:Tunnell’s theorem says that if n is an odd congruent number then #f(n)=2#g(n) — the size of f(n) is twice the size of g(n). Furthermore, if the BSD Conjecture holds for the (elliptic) curve y²=x³-n²x then the converse statement holds. That is, if n is an odd number and #f(n)=2#g(n) then n is a congruent number.(There is a similar statement for even numbers, interested readers are referred to Theorem 4.11 here.)Essentially, Tunnell’s Theorem provides a concrete method of checking whether any positive (square-free) integer is a congruent number — settling the Congruent Number Problem.The obstruction lies in that the BSD conjecture is exactly that: a conjecture. This conjecture is a central area of research within modern Number Theory. It is also a Clay Millennium Prize problem. The person (or persons) who solves it receives the prize of $1,000,000, whilst also settling a 1000 year old problem — a double win!ReferencesChao Li — Recent Developments On Quadratic Twists Of Elliptic CurvesKeith Conrad — The Congruent Number Problemhttps://awwalkerdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/homslides_12_congruent_number_problem.pdfWritten byMaleeha KhawajaFollowMathematicsNumber TheoryFibonacciFermatMore from Maleeha KhawajaFollowMore From MediumThe Coupon Collector problemHaris Angelidakis in Cantor’s ParadiseHow I Predicted the Exact Outcome of 10 Premier League GamesJuan Ramirez in ILLUMINATIONTraveling Salesman ProblemKishore Premkumar in IVYMobility TechBytesFinding the Work Done by the Electric Field as You Move a Charge Near a DipoleRhett AllainHow to Prove the Infinity of PrimesSydney Birbrower in Cantor’s ParadisePrincess Alice and the 1,001 SuitorsAdam Hrankowski in MathAdamEverything You Always Wanted to Know About DerivativesŁukasz Gebel in The StartupRichard Feynman on the Distinction between Future and PastJørgen Veisdal in Cantor’s ParadiseAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
My favorite number zero,https://medium.com/@hnguyen417/my-favorite-number-zero-9b356eddbb0a?source=tag_archive---------6-----------------------,"Mathematics,Science,Education,Life,Creative","Most people will probably never answer zero as their favorite number among real numbers. It’s probably because we start by counting from one. As for me, zero was not the obvious choice but it has slowly become the most powerful and most admired number in my book. Usually, the number zero means there is nothing, but it’s a number of absolute power. It can nullify any number or take everything away from it. Speaking of finance, it’s not the number in front of it that’s important, it is the number of zeros behind it that quantify how much money you have. A number that is trapped in a root symbol can escape under two circumstances. They have a square root or meet the powerful zero. In life, zero can give you everything or you can have nothing at all.

The Art of Python’s Ceiling and Floor using Operator,https://medium.com/@kevingxyz/the-art-of-pythons-ceiling-and-floor-notation-684d4d354e1e?source=tag_archive---------7-----------------------,"Python,Mathematics,Coding,Programming,Clean Code","Ceiling and Floor Function Abridged EditionFor lazy readers, you may just skip to the end for the TL;DR cheatsheet version of this articleYou probably have used ceiling and floor mathematical functions in Python. It is just a simple math.ceil(x / y) and math.floor(x / y) respectively, when performing a division, right? Yes, that is correct!However, I seems to have knack of finding the most unorthodox way of doing things, which led to discover uncommon ways to express my code.During the older days during my first foray into Python, I came across this wonderful way of expressing floor:# Alternative to:# b = math.floor( 10 / 3 )b = 10 // 3Double slashes, and that is all for expressing math.floor(x / y) simply.What about ceiling? You may start to google but you might not be able to find anything on this immediately from Python’s documentation, since ceiling function does not comes with it’s own operator like floor function.However, what we can do is to utilize Python’s way of dealing with floor function and utilize it in a slightly different fashion to derive a new way of expressing the ceiling function.You definitely know that executing the above example code, you will get a value of 3 for b. But what about having negative number in the mix?b = -10 // 3You will get -4, since it applies the floor function to a negative number, essentially rounding it down more negatively.In Python, the floor function rounds the value towards negative infinity. By playing on this principle, you will realize that by taking the negative of negative floor, can do something like this:b = -(-10 // 3)In the above code, you will be getting 4.Now, you can simply express the ceiling function differently:# Alternative to:# b = math.ceil( 10 / 3 )b = - ( -10 // 3)That’s it! You can now choose to express ceiling function using operators only!TL;DR for lazy readers:Floor functionfloor = x // yCeiling functionceil = - ( -x // y)If you have any feedback or anything that you wish to share, feel free to drop a comment 👇!Written byKevinTechnopreneur, Rocket Scientist, AI and Security Enthusiast, Serverless Advocate, Full Stack Engineer, Native Android & iOS, PythonistaFollowPythonMathematicsCodingProgrammingClean CodeMore from KevinFollowTechnopreneur, Rocket Scientist, AI and Security Enthusiast, Serverless Advocate, Full Stack Engineer, Native Android & iOS, PythonistaMore From MediumKotlin — Copy to MutateJ Banks in Software TidbitsCan you learn to code on your phone?Simon Hargreaves in The StartupSwitch Statements Won’t Fix Yandere SimulatorJoseph Mellor in The StartupHow to Create A Spell Checker in QualtricsAlbert Su in The StartupMore fun with k8s and pythonBryanLooking Under the Hood: HTTP Over TCP SocketsBora Tunca in The StartupExplaining your Watson Assistant chatbot using Watson OpenScalePrem Piyush GoyalBaby Steps Towards Decoupling Monoliths on AWSYiquan Ong in The StartupAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Beauty of Mathematics,https://medium.com/@hrp03/beauty-of-mathematics-f1ac9aee9501?source=tag_archive---------8-----------------------,"Mathematics,Inspiration,Startup,Science,Data","Whatever you can see, is countable. But we can’t say exactly, how much it is? That’s the beauty of the language, the universe is written in, Mathematics.Today we’ll see some mesmerizing and my favorite equations and symbols of mathematics.Let’s start with the symbolsPi (π)3.141592653589793238The most mysterious, beautiful, and complex symbol of mathematics, Pi. It is represented by the lower case greek letter π. It has never-ending decimals, which makes people more and more curious to examine its value.Wikipedia definitionπ is commonly defined as the ratio of a circle’s circumference C and diameter d.π = C / dSome mathematicians say it may contain the whole DNA of the universe.The irrational number Pi is used in fields like physics, medical, computer science, architecture, space, and many more.Phi (φ)1.6180339887498948482It is also called a golden ratio. φ is the symbol used to denote the golden ratio. This was first described by the Greek mathematician Euclid. He called it “The division in extreme and mean ratio”.Wikipedia definitionTwo quantities are in the golden ratio if their ratio is the same as the ratio of their sum to the larger of the two quantities.golden ratio formulaEvery beautiful thing in the universe is definitely in the golden ratio. The flower petals, shells, galaxies, etc. are an example of this.The ratio of any two successive Fibonacci numbers is very close to the golden ratio. As this is known for a long time, people have found this in many places. You can find the golden ratio everywhere in nature.Let’s start with equations/theoremsPythagoras theoremright triangleThis is one of the most amazing discoveries in mathematics, by a great mathematician Pythagoras.Definition From Maths is fun:In the right angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.Pythagoras Theorem can be written in asPythagoras theoremEuler’s IdentityThis equation contains the most loved symbols of mathematics.e : euler’s number ( the base of natural logarithms)i : imaginary unitπ : ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diametereuler’s identityThis equation represents complex numbers, algebra, geometry, and arithmetic all together in a single equation.So these are some shorter information about mathematics, which is very very less if you are discussing maths. But good to start with.There are never-ending things in Mathematics, I’ll share them in upcoming writeups.Just to name a few topics are complex numbers, logarithms, calculus, geometry, and many more.I hope you enjoyed this short information.Be CuriousHimanshu PrajapatiWritten byHimanshu PrajapatiSoftware Engineer and ResearcherFollowMathematicsInspirationStartupScienceDataMore from Himanshu PrajapatiFollowSoftware Engineer and ResearcherMore From MediumCOVID-19 probabilistic thinkingMichael TamillowHow long should your dog leash be?João Paulo Figueira in tb.lx insiderHow to Solve America’s Math ProblemHazel Clementine in However, MathematicsThe Product Rule — an IntuitionAdam Hrankowski in MathAdamHow High Is This Cliff, and Why Would You Jump Off It?Rhett AllainBounded (Pseudo) Random NumbersAnuj Kumar in The StartupChaos Makes the Multiverse UnnecessaryNautilus in Nautilus MagazineCalculating the Distance Between Two Points on EarthBilal Himite in The StartupAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Newton’s Third Law,https://medium.com/physics-daily/newtons-third-law-a100a001b36d?source=tag_archive---------9-----------------------,"Physics,Amazing,Wonder,Mathematics,Science","The Third Law of Motion is the most popular of all. It says about the action-reaction nature of forces. I am sure you have heard of it. This law is really important in understanding physics and what this law says is also truly amazing. When I try and think how Newton arrived at this conclusion, it blows up my mind. Observing such phenomenon requires great focus and only very few people like Newton have this.This law states that- “Each and every action has an equal and opposite reaction.” And what’s actually so amazing about this law is that it applies to each and every object, from objects as light as a feather to the whole entire earth itself, all observe it the same way. Just imagine if you stamp your feet against the ground, you apply a force on the earth but at the very same instant the earth applies an equal amount of force on you, how amazing that is! If we try and punch a brick wall it hurts a lot, but try asking yourself why, why does it hurt? You are punching the wall the wall isn’t punching you but still you get hurt, why is that so? The answer to this question and many such questions is given by this law. Well coming back to our question, why do we get hurt, what is happening there is that when we try and punch the wall, we exert a high amount of force on that wall and according to Newton’s Third law the wall exerts a same amount of force back on our hand, and that is why we get hurt.Now we can reason why we get hurt. It feels nice when we can reason things. Remember that curiosity and our quest for knowledge and the ability to reason is what have gave us humans all we have today. Curiosity is the basis of discovery. The flame of curiosity should always glow bigger.

Googol’s Grandiose Gamble,https://medium.com/an-idea/googols-gamble-7043e010c02c?source=tag_archive---------10-----------------------,"Googol,One Equals Two,Equations,Irrationality,Mathematics","Photo by George Becker on PexelsFor many years, Googol carried a light burden. He knew how to prove the impossible, namely that one equals two. Had it been correct, this 1 = 2 equation would have had many ramifications, including that of the absurdity of life, notwithstanding its already obvious irrationality — fait accompli. The equation was derived by means of seven simple steps:Most people faced with these equations could not find the error, or as Googol called it, the trap. Most of them laughed about it, while a few got confused and even worried, understanding the implications of such a truth.Reader! Do not read any further if you want to give it a crack! But do come back to read the rest of the story whether you were able to find it or not!Googol wished it to be true before finding the trap. It would have meant the end of logic, the end of the rational, the end of science, and a foundation for the illogical, a foundation for the irrational, a foundation for religion. But (A -B) in Step 4 was equal to zero given that it was postulated in Step 1 that A was equal to B. And dividing both sides of the equation by (A - B) in Step 5 was hence erroneous given that a division by zero is undefined, thus negating the last equation of 1 = 2.An Idea (by Ingenious Piece)Everything Begins With An IdeaFollow50 GoogolOne Equals TwoEquationsIrrationalityMathematics50 claps50 clapsWritten byPatrick M.

"Eratosthenes: Right Time, Right Place, and Right Tools",https://medium.com/@finply/eratosthenes-right-time-right-place-and-right-tools-94267e46d10?source=tag_archive---------11-----------------------,"Space,Entrepreneurship,Entrepreneur,Earth,Mathematics","A magnificent view of the Earth’s curvature from space.Eratosthenes of Cyrene was born in the third century BC. He used his extensive knowledge and tools to measure Earth’s circumference with an estimated error of less than two percent. The way he did it requires a little trigonometry, but if you want to dig deeper into this story, we used Douglas Hubbard’s book “How to Measure Anything: Finding the Value of Intangibles in Business”.Eratosthenes was the head curator for the famous ancient library of Alexandria. He probably got to this post because he liked to read a lot. On a warm summer day in Alexandria, Eratosthenes read a book about a city about 600 miles south of Alexandria. The paper claimed that on that same day of the year, at a particular time of the day, the sun shined down on the well and without shadows, onlookers could see the clear water at the bottom. Eratosthenes looked around, found a well in his city, and noticed that there were shadows in the Alexandrian wells at the time given in the book. From this, he concluded that, as proposed by many before him, the Earth had to be round. He knew if he measured the length of the shadows of a stick of a chosen length in both cities on the day above and time, he could derive the curvature of the spherical Earth. The stick placed in Syene (the southern town) did not have a shadow, so he only needed the length in Alexandria to calculate Earth’s curvature. If he could measure the distance between the two cities precisely, he could extrapolate this distance and this curvature to figure out the circumference of the Earth. And guess what? He did.The lessons from Eratosthenes’s achievements are many and allow us to go into a few more that can help entrepreneurs. First and foremost, be ready and keep up with your firm’s ecosystem. Read everything you can about your business, be aware of your industry up and down the stream, and learn as much about your customers. The tale above is a simple version, but the lesson remains: Only those prepared will be able to take advantage of opportunities. At Finply, we want to help you think critically about this by segmenting your revenue streams. Our revenue app is fast, which will enable founders to create multiple models in little time which helps them find the most important drivers and risks of their business.Secondly, the right tool can save you a lot of time and work. Imagine another way to get at Eratosthenes’ measurement at the time. It would probably entail sailing and walking around the world, which, as far as we know, was impossible or prohibitively costly. The right way was using knowledge and math to figure out this problem. In the same way, our apps provide fast and precise tools to estimate your revenue. They are not a multifaceted spreadsheet, but rather concise automation that gets the output you need, quickly and accurately.Finally, a good approximation calculated in a short period is slow and costly, but a precise estimate. Finply exists to give entrepreneurs their valuable time back. We want you to figure out critical aspects of your startup, not stressing whether a given cell in a convoluted spreadsheet is correct. We also give you the power to adapt. If a segment is no longer valid or is growing faster than you thought, you can change this in seconds and be sure that the resulting projections will accurately reflect the modifications.To get started using Finply, head over to our signup page.Written byFinplyWe help ease the burden of financial modeling for entrepreneurs and founders.

The Seven Bridges of Königsberg,https://medium.com/stamatics-iit-kanpur/the-seven-bridges-of-k%C3%B6nigsberg-268f73122e82?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Euler,Mathematics,Discrete,Graph Theory","Königsberg is undoubtedly one of the most famous cities in mathematics, in part due to its interesting geography. The city of Königsberg (now Kaliningrad, in Russia) was built on two sides of a river, near the site of two large islands. The four sectors of the city were connected by seven bridges, as shown in the following map. Carl Ehler, a mathematician, was puzzled by a question —“Which route would allow someone to cross all 7 bridges, without crossing any of them more than once?”The Map of KönigsbergCan you figure out such a route?Leonhard EulerNo, you can’t! In 1736, while proving that it’s impossible to find such a route, Leonhard Euler laid the foundations for graph theory.Before we dive right in, let’s talk about certain preliminaries on graph theory we’ll need, to better understand this historical problem.So, what is a graph? A graph is just a collection of nodes and edges (very different from the graphs you’ve seen in calculus!). For the sake of simplicity, throughout this post, we’ll talk only about undirected graphs — i.e. graphs wherein there is no sense of direction associated with the edges. Also, the number of edges touching a particular vertex correspond to its degree.Constructing the map’s equivalent graphThe map of the ancient city can be easily represented as the graph on the right (why?) — where the edges and nodes correspond to bridges and sectors of the city, respectively.We’ve now developed sufficient weaponry to attack the problem, so let’s begin by formalizing what we’re looking for — an Euler walk. An Euler walk in an undirected graph is a walk (a sequence of alternating vertices and edges) that uses each edge exactly once. If such a walk exists, the graph is called traversable (which our graph is not!).To get a bit more mathematical, let’s denote the start and end vertices with S and V respectively. Furthermore, consider the following minor yet critical observation — Every vertex that isn’t S or V, must have an even degree.Why? Let’s give it some thought. The only way to pass a vertex that isn’t the start or the end vertex is by entering through an edge and exiting through another. Since we can’t use an edge more than once, this shows that the degree of all such vertices (not S or V) must be even. Note that there’s no restriction on how many times we visit a vertex, as long as we traverse all bridges (edges) exactly once.The map of Königsberg (as a graph) has at least three vertices with odd degrees, indicating that it is impossible to find a route with the desired properties! We solved it!On a practical note, all the seven bridges were destroyed by a bombing raid in 1944 and only five of them were rebuilt. Königsberg became part of the Soviet Union (now Russia) at the end of World War II and was renamed Kaliningrad.Wolfram MathWorldThe bridges bb and dd were destroyed (and never rebuilt), and aa and cc are now a single bridge passing above A with a stairway in the middle leading down to A.

The Universe is in Pi,https://medium.com/@bodilyrobert/the-universe-is-in-pi-87ff19f20708?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Pi,Math,Numbers,Mathematics,Universe","The fascinating truth about irrational numbersPhoto by Shihao Mei on UnsplashPi is an irrational number, meaning its decimal digits continue on forever and do not systematically repeat. Let me give you a few examples to give you a better sense for what an irrational number is.Rational Numbers: can be turned into a ratio (or fraction).1 (1/1)0.5 (1/2)0.75 (3/4)0.1111 (1111/10000)0.142857142857 repeating (1/7)Irrational Numbers: cannot be turned into a ratio (or fraction).e (Euler’s number) ~ 2.718 and goes on forever without repeatingsqrt(2) ~ 1.41 and goes on forever without repeatingpi ~ 3.1415926535 and goes on forever without repeatingYou get the picture. If you can turn the number into a fraction, then it is rational. If the number goes on forever without repeating, then it is irrational.Now that you understand the difference between rational and irrational numbers, let’s dive into the arguably most awesome irrational number pi.Pi is technically defined as the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. This means that if we measure the circumference and diameter of a circle, and then we take the circumference length and divide it by the diameter, we will get the number pi.Because pi is an irrational number (goes on forever and never repeats), we can find any number within the decimal digits of pi as long as we go out far enough. Now when I say any number, I truly mean any number — your birthday (year included), your phone number, your social security number, or even your address growing up (though you’ll have to encode the letters and spaces as numbers).To prove that this is true, I downloaded 1 billion digits of pi and started finding numbers in it:My birthday (year included) is first located at about digit 47,990,000. I say “first located” because if we kept going out more digits we would eventually find my birthday again.My phone number (area code included) is first located at about digit 218,817,000 of pi.My social security number is located somewhere in the upper hundreds of millions of digits of pi.The address I had when I was growing up is located in the first 25 million digits of pi.Ok, this is pretty cool. But can you really find ANY number in pi? And the answer is a resounding yes!…but it might not be feasible to find in our lifetimes due to the complexity of computing the digits of pi, and then finding the really long number in pi’s digits.To give you a better sense of why this is the case, the current world record for computing the most digits of pi is 31 trillion digits, which used up 170 Terabytes of data (the equivalent of 34,000,000 music tracks), and took 21 virtual machines 121 days to finish, which is about 7 years if a single machine did it.Now 31 trillion digits might seem like a lot of digits, but in reality we are barely scratching the surface. Here are the probabilities of finding a certain number in the first 31 trillion digits of pi (current world record) broken down based on the number of digits in the number (you can dig a little deeper into the process behind computing these probabilities if you want):1 digit: 100%2 digits: 100%3 digits: 100%4 digits: 100%5 digits: 100%6 digits: 100%7 digits: 100%8 digits: 100%9 digits: 100%10 digits: 100%11 digits: 100%12 digits: 99.99%13 digits: 95.50%14 digits: 26.66%15 digits: 3.05%16 digits: 0.31%17 digits: 0.03%This means that every 10 digit phone number is found in the first 31 trillion digits of pi; all 9 digit social security numbers are found in the first 31 trillion digits of pi; and every single birthday is found in the first 31 trillion digits of pi.It also means that we are only guaranteed to find a number in the first 31 trillion digits of pi if the number is less than 12 digits long. This is a depressingly small number of digits for the large sounding 31 trillion digits of pi number.To make 31 trillion sound even smaller, if we wanted to guarantee that we could find any 100 digit number in pi, we would have to go out 100 Googol digits of pi before the probability reached 100%. If you don’t know how big 1 Googol is, it is hugely mind-bogglingly enormous. It would take billions of years for billions of virtual machines that are billions of times as powerful as current machines to compute pi to 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 Googol digits — meaning we are not even close to computing pi to enough digits to even find every 100 digit number (depressing… I know).“Wait, but you said the UNIVERSE was in pi” you might be thinking. Well I’m glad you brought it up. Let’s start with a piece of the universe: computer code.Any Computer Program Exists in the Digits of PiAny piece of software code, written in symbols and letters, can be converted to base 10. Base 10 is our number system that uses 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as the numbers, which also corresponds to the values in the digits of pi. To encode something to base 10, we could use the following conversion:A = 1B = 2C = 3…Y = 25Z = 26\ = 27/ = 28… (room for 72 more symbol characters)AA = 101AB = 102AC = 103etc.This means we could take any computer program, convert the code to base 10, and then find it in the digits of pi as long as we go out far enough. Cool!Every Mountain Can Be Found in the Digits of PiA mountain is comprised of atoms arranged into different shapes and structures to make up rocks. Each of these atoms has a particular location (think latitude, longitude, and elevation), as well as a particular composition. If we take the atomic composition of a rock or crystalline structure and convert it to element and position in base 10, we can string these elements and element locations together to encode the mountain in base 10 form. Then, we just waltz along the digits of pi until we find the match! Awesome!The Human Genome is in PieFrom Wikipedia, “The human genome is a complete set of nucleic acid sequences for humans, encoded as DNA within the 23 chromosome pairs in cell nuclei and in a small DNA molecule found within individual mitochondria.” The human genome consists of base pairs: Adenine (A), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C), and Thymine (T). Each letter corresponds to a number, A=1, C=3, G=7, and T=20 (or A=1, C=2, G=3, T=4), which means we can convert the human genome to base 10 which can then be found in the digits of pi. Nice!The Universe is in PiFollowing the same logic used above, we can encode any physical thing into base 10 form by reducing it to its atomic structure and position in space. We can also encode any informational or technological thing by converting letters and symbols to base 10 form. This means that the universe is in fact found in base 10 encoded form in the digits of pi.The universe is indeed found within the digits of pi.FUN FACTSNow that you know the universe is in pi, it’s time for some fun facts about the first billion digits of pi.There are 2 self-locating (or “golden” as I like to call them) numbers that I have computed so far. This means that the number itself indicates where it is located in the digits of pi. The number 5 is the first one (5 is located at the 5th digit of pi -> 3.1415), and yes, the 3 definitely counts as the first digit of pi. The second one is 271,070! Yes, at the 271,070th digit of pi, you will find the number 271,070. How cool is that?The famous number 867-5309 is first found at digit 9,202,592 of pi.The meaning of life, the universe, and everything, 42, is first found at digit 93 of pi, and is found 10,003,368 times in the first billion digits of pi.86 is the most commonly occurring two digit number in the first billion digits of pi.In terms of recurring numbers, we get 8 0’s, 9 1’s, 8 2’s, 8 3’s, 8 4’s, 8 5’s, 10 6’s, 9 7’s, 9 8’s, and 9 9’s. That 10 6’s string is pretty special!Is pi found within pi? Disappointingly, only the first 8 digits of pi reoccur within the first billion digits of pi. 31415926 is first found at digit 50,366,473 of pi and is not found again in the first billion digits of pi.The longest palindrome in the first billion digits of pi is 74054579700797545047, and is first found at digit 824,827,925 of pi.The 42nd Fibonacci number 165,580,141 is the first number in the Fibonacci sequence not found in the first billion digits of pi. 42 truly is the answer to everything. The 41st Fibonacci number is 102,334,155 and is the last number in the Fibonacci sequence to be found in the first billion digits of pi. It is first found at digit 366,567,059 of pi.0123456789 unfortunately doesn’t show up in the first billion digits of pi.

From Circle to ML via Batman: Part I,https://towardsdatascience.com/from-circle-to-ml-via-batman-part-i-51ab4cf2db66?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"Machine Learning,Mathematics,Creativity,Art,Beautiful Things","“M”, ”L” and the Batman symbol are results of single Inequations each. View GraphBatman Inequation I: View GraphIntroduction:The circle in itself is really pretty, ain’t it? But, with some curiosity, you can go beyond a circle. It doesn’t need any calculus or any advanced concepts, just with our favourite class 10 mathematics and with some beautiful ideas, we can go beyond the circle and even create the Batman Inequation. This article is about creating inequations for whatever shapes we want. In the second part, we will see how we can improve and generalize this framework and derive commonly used functions in Machine Learning.This is a journey from the curve on the left to the one on the rightAll visualisations created here are generated in openly available software like Desmos and Geogebra. I suggest the readers go ahead and play with these equations using these tools and explore the beauty by themselves.The potential of a Circle!The humble circle describes multiple points which lie equidistant from a given centre point. Let’s have a look at our familiar friend in all its forms. When all points lie at a given distance, let’s consider 1 unit, we get a circle. Points with distance less than 1 lie inside the circle and ones with more than 1 lie outside the circle. In 3 dimensions a paraboloid with the equation z=x²+y²–1 forms our circle when it intersects with the XY plane.Different views of a circleWe all know that a circle normally takes the form x²+y²=1. What do you think will happen if we go beyond the power of 2? That’s where the magic lies. Let’s take the values from 2 to 10 and observe what happens.Powers going from 3 to 10For even powers, we see the circle starts looking like a square and it does become one at infinite power. But why does it do so and especially at even powers? We will first try to understand how the points lying on the curve (x^n+y^n=1) behave and then look into the nature and properties of points within the curve (x^n+y^n<=1).Let’s understand odd powers first. If the power is odd, and say x is negative, then the result of x^n term is also negative, thus y^n term takes a value greater than 1 so that the sum remains 1. For large powers, the difference of 2 numbers becomes insignificant with an increase in power. Let’s take an example, if x⁵ is -100,000 then the value of y⁵ should be 100,001 to satisfy the equation. But, we are plotting x and y, so the values of x and y which justify the equation are (-10, 10.0000199..). This is extremely close to the line y=-x. This is also applicable for the case with negative y and positive x. Also note that higher the power, smaller is the deviation from y=-x. This cannot be possible with negative y and negative x, and that’s why we don’t see a part of the function in that quadrant. When x and y both are positive, we see something like a part of a square. This is because if x is significantly smaller than 1, like 0.7, then x⁵ becomes very small very fast (0.168 here). Thus y⁵ has to be 1-x⁵ which is 0.832, which means y will be very close to 1 but slightly less (0.9638) here. The same logic applies the other way around. So, for x values away from 1, y takes values near 1 (like a horizontal edge) and for x values near 1, y drops to 0 fast (like a vertical edge). This makes the curve look like a part of the square. This can be seen below:Demonstrating nature with n=9.Once odd powers are understood, understanding even powers becomes much easier. The case of negative values now doesn’t exist so the entire function looks like a square in all the quadrants. This can be seen below. This is what we will focus on from here onwards.Graph for n=10Finally, the circle and the square are not at odds with each other and have set their powers even. With the hope that you square up with these ideas and doubts don’t encircle you, we loop back to mathematics without cutting any corners.Wait!!! There is a lot left in the store of mathematics. We also know how to shift coordinates. Subtraction for left and addition for right. So we can not only generate a square, but we can also position it anywhere we want. Not only that, but we can also rescale and thus stretch the square and make into a rectangle. Let’s try it:A rectangle instead: (2(x-3))¹⁰+(3(y-2))¹⁰<=1; View GraphBy now, some of you familiar with deeper mathematics would be able to see how this is related to ideas in Minkowski Distance and F-norm but we will leave them for the future.Beyond CirclesWhile going beyond circles and rectangles, we have to take a slightly different perspective on these graphs. This time we look from the perspective of inequations for points within the curve which have a sum lesser than 1. If the sum of 2 positive numbers is less than 1 then both the numbers have to be less than 1. Similarly, if there are many such terms, then all of them have to be as small as possible so that the sum never exceeds 1. Even if one of the terms is greater than 1 then the inequality will not hold. Isn’t this very similar to the idea of intersection? Selected points should lie in all sets (i.e. all inequations should give values close to 0) if they are not in even one of the sets then they are not selected (even if one of the terms is greater than 1 then the inequation does not hold true). Thus, the squares made above can be seen as the region of intersection of two terms, x^(2n)<1 and y^(2n)<1 (referred to as trenches for their shape) as shown below. Higher values of n allow the terms to be as small as possible.The squares(z = x¹⁰+y¹⁰) as the intersection of 2 trenches made by z=x¹⁰ and z=y¹⁰And now we have taken a humongous step. We can make very complex figures which emerge from such intersections and take our designing skills to the next level.A diamond as the intersection of diagonal trenches: z = (y-2x)¹⁰+(y+2x)¹⁰We can get back our graph by just making z=1:The same figure in 2D: (y-2x)¹⁰+(y+2x)¹⁰<=1. Higher the power, better is the approximation of intersection. View GraphLet’s try this strategy on something simple:This is a simple shape with 3 edges and an arc so is easy to make. Expression: ((y+x-1)/2)⁵⁰+((y-x-1)/2)⁵⁰+(y-0.5)⁵⁰+(x²+y²)⁵⁰<=1; View GraphRemember that the trenches we make have the walls at the following positions: y — f(x)=1 and y — f(x)= -1. This is because all absolute values below 1 tend to zero thus are part of the trench whereas all absolute values greater than one increase very fast thus forming the walls. So we can use the trenches shown below.We are now completely equipped for making the batman symbol and covering more than half of the journey. The strategy is not to just intersect but to also eliminate regions from the curve to carve out the shape. This is done by taking curves one by one and refining them and their positioning to match the shape. In some places, the curves had to be inverted i.e. the region greater than 1 had to be made less than 1 and vice versa. This was done by changing the sign of the power of the curves. Note that this strategy can be applied to many shapes. All these curves have the property of being greater than 1 on one side (away from symbol) and less than 1 on the other (towards symbol). Thus every section has its own curve which is then combined using the sum of large even powers as described earlier.The following expressions were used (selected according to the shape of the curve):f1(x,y):(0.5(x-1.16)^(2.8))^(2) +(y+1.6): lower edge of right wingf2(x,y):(0.5(x+1.16)^(2.8))^(2) +(y+1.6): lower edge of left wingf3(x,y):(0.5(y+1.6))^(8)+(x+3): left edge of left wingf4(x,y):(0.5(y+1.6))^(8)+(-x+3): right edge of right wingf5(x,y):y+0.6: upper horizontal linef6(x,y):(3(x+0.45))^(14)-y+1: left curve between head and wingf7(x,y):(3(x-0.45))^(14)-y+1: right curve between head and wingf8(x,y):e^((3(y-0.1)-258.18((1.9x+0.1)(1.9x-0.1))^(1.6))): forms the head and earsWhen all these curves are combined the following figure is obtained:Note that there are extra bits on the sides but the original function is intact.To remove the extra bits, the function is cleaned by adding another term which gives values close to 0 near the shape we want and values greater than 1 in places we don’t want. This makes the final figure as:The above figure is cleaned and has the following equation (the first term is extra); View Graph; What does the first term do? It doesn’t kill our curve, so it simply makes it stronger (by eliminating unwanted parts).We can identify all the parts of the curve individually as seen below:All curves of the form f(x,y)=1 shown with the inequationConclusion and What’s coming nextWe have just obtained a deep understanding of circles and similar inequations with high even powers. We understood why they behave like the intersection of inequation and mastered this by creating our own batman inequation. Everything’s impossible until somebody does it. Well, the batman equation was created about a decade ago so we tried our hand at Batman Inequation. But, we still had to deal with large powers, had to trim our figure and the process still seemed complex. Part II of this blog will remove all these challenges and simplify everything. It will also explain how these ideas are relevant in machine learning in the form of Softmax(our classification friend), Softplus (well-known activation function), log-sum-exp(commonly used function and father of Softmax) and other related directions.The math is the heaviest just before the application.

Should linear programming be used to reduce subjectivity in the supplier selection process?,https://medium.com/@katie.ziyan.zhang/should-linear-programming-be-used-to-reduce-subjectivity-in-the-supplier-selection-process-e8b4e172e674?source=tag_archive---------4-----------------------,"Procurement,Linear Programming,Evaluation,Mathematics,Linear Algebra","The linear programming technique (Data Envelopment Analysis) objectively determines the weights of evaluation criteria after suppliers are scored as opposed to the traditional process where the buyer pre-determines the evaluation criteria weightings before suppliers are scoredIntroductionIn this article, I illustrate, through example, a linear programming technique called Data Envelopment Analysis (“DEA”) to score and rank suppliers. This approach is premised on a mathematical model that objectively assigns evaluation criteria weights after suppliers have been scored on evaluation criteria.It has been argued that DEA provides fairer and more robust supplier selection results because of its objectivity and its ability to offer a fuller relative evaluation of suppliers against each other.I personally have never seen or heard of this approach in my procurement career — in fact determining evaluation weights after suppliers have been scored would raise a big red flag for any procurement person ! So I wanted to understand it more.In this article, I outline the approach, intuition and motivation behind DEA and then consider its usefulness in procurement evaluation.This article is for people who:understand procurement and are interested in a more objective way to score suppliers in an evaluation processunderstand linear programming and are interested to see its application in a procurement processThe dummy scores I will be usingFor this section, I will be illustrating a traditional versus DEA approach for supplier selection based on the following made-up scores:Made-up scores (raw)I attempted to replicated some supplier ‘types’ in these scores to make them more meaningful:‘Supplier E ’ (all the bells and whistles): Meets all needs very well but at a high cost‘Supplier B’ (the OK incumbent): Scores OK on all criteria with a price similar to current costs‘Supplier G’ (cheap but scored poorly): Least expensive but low confidence that they can actually deliverFor the example, I normalised all scores to between 0 and 1:Made-up scores (transformed)There are many ways to treat Price such as not providing a score at all. However, for this example, I have scored Price by indexing against the lowest tendered price ($650,000). For example, the score of Supplier A is calculated as $650,000 / $950,000 = 68% while Supplier G gets 100%, because it quoted the lowest price.Traditional Approach: Pre-Determined WeightingsThe approachAny fair evaluation process requires buyers to pre-determine evaluation weights before receiving any proposals from suppliers.Buyers should not choose their weights after proposals come back because buyers may choose weights that favour certain suppliers which makes the process unfair.The final scores calculated from the traditional approach are a simple sum product of the scores against the pre-determined weight.The traditional process would rank ‘Supplier D’ as the top supplier.This makes total sense — why do we need to over-complicate it?Proponents of the DEA approach have argued that pre-determining weights has its problems:Pre-determined weights are too subjective: How weights are determined is quite subjective, leading to lower transparency in the procurement processPre-determined weights can still ‘favour’ bidders: Buyers can still ‘favour’ some suppliers by assigning higher weights to criteria that will benefit only some suppliersThe same authors observe that the DEA approach, on the other hand, provides every supplier‘…the right to be evaluated according to the set of weights that favor her against the other competitors’As such, this was deemed preferable to the traditional approach because:Weights are more objective: The set of weights are determined by a pre-defined (linear programming) algorithmEqual treatment for suppliers: It guaranteed equal treatment of all suppliersFull relative evaluation: It allowed a full relative evaluation by accounting for the advantages of every bidSo how does this look in our example?DEA approach: Optimised WeightingsOverview of the DEA approachFind optimal weightings for each supplier: Find weightings for each supplier that maximises their final weighted score through a linear programming techniqueCalculate the supplier scores based against the optimal weightings of itself and those of all other suppliers: For example, 8 different scores for Supplier A would be calculated by multiplying the score of Supplier A against the different weightings of Suppliers A through to Supplier HCalculate final score and rank: Average the scores calculated in Step 2 to obtain the final score for each supplierStep 1 : Determine the optimised weightsThe appeal of linear programming is that once a decision problem is represented by a linear programming model, you are guaranteed a mathematically optimal result. You can do this with just a few clicks in Excel’s Solver package for simple problems.The linear programming model components for applying DEA to supplier selection are as follows:Objective: The supplier scoreVariables: The supplier evaluation criteria weights (each supplier will have different weights to maximise their weighted score)Constraints: Constraints vary across research papers — I felt that this approach, which allowed buyers to rank criteria rather than not assigning any weighting at all, more reflective of reality (buyers generally have some idea of what is important, even if they don’t know the exact weighting). I also added a constraint to cap the weighting on Price as allowing Price to make up 100% of the criteria is inappropriate in most cases (and make most procurement professionals balk!)Therefore, the model written for ‘Supplier A’ looks like this:Linear program model to determine optimum weights for ‘Supplier A’You can then input the above model and determine the optimum weights ‘w’ in Excel using its Solver package. Doing this for all suppliers gave the following results:Optimised weights and score for each supplierThe optimised score is higher than the original scores (calculated with the traditional approach) for all suppliers due to Solver finding the optimal criteria weights to maximise each supplier’s scores.Note, for example, that Solver assigned a 40% Price weighting (the maximum weighting that Price could take) to Supplier G which had a Price score of 100%. If we did not add in this constraint, Solver would have allocated 100% weighting to Price for Supplier G.Step 2 & 3: Calculate the final scoreFor each supplier, a total of 8 different scores are calculated based on its score multiplied weighted by the optimal weights of all other suppliers. For example, the 8 different scores calculated for Supplier A are:Supplier A score x Supplier A optimised weightingsSupplier A score x Supplier B optimised weightingsSupplier A score x Supplier C optimised weightings…8. Supplier A score x Supplier H optimised weightingsThe final score for A is the average of all 8 scores above — this is the DEA ‘cross-efficiency’ score.Final DEA — CE score; for example 70% is calculated by the sum product of ‘Supplier A’ scores and ‘Supplier B’ optimal weightingsComparison of ResultsThe figure below overlays the final score resulting from the Traditional and DEA approach with the individual criteria scores of each supplier.Both approaches lead to the same top 4 and bottom 4 so at a high level, the approaches have resulted in similar ranked result.However, there is a swap in the 1st and 2nd ranking between the approaches. In this hypothetical example, the difference is only 1% but for the sake of comparison which one better aligns with our intuition for which supplier should be the ‘best’?The intuition of the traditional resultIn the traditional approach, Supplier H came 2nd to Supplier D because its scores didn’t perform as well against the pre-determined weights.However , if the original weighs of Price — 30% and Systems and Resources — 10% were changed slightly to Price — 35% and Systems and Resources — 10% , then ‘Supplier H’ score would be tied to ‘Supplier D’!This is just a shift of 5% of weighting and arguably quite arbitrary. I doubt that any buyer can confidently say that Systems and Resources — 10% is a much more ‘correct’ weight than Systems and Resources — 10%.The intuition of the DEA resultsIn the DEA approach, Supplier H came 1st because it achieved the best performance against the weights that favoured itself as well as the weights that favoured all its competitors. Intuitively, I think of it as Supplier H competes well against the strengths of all other suppliers and therefore has the best all-rounder performance.Supplier H has a low score for ‘Innovation’ and ‘Systems and Resources’ but this did not matter because other suppliers also scored low in these areas. This means that the optimal weighs for these criteria were generally low across all suppliers — Solver did not allocate high weights to these areas as high weights in these areas would not have maximised the scores of most suppliers.If other suppliers were strong in ‘Innovation’ and ‘Systems and Resources’ (resulting in a higher weights allocated to these criteria), then Supplier H would certainly not have been ranked 1st. Alternatively, if we specified that these criteria must have higher weights than the others as a model constraint, Supplier H would also not have been ranked 1st.Final thoughts — is it worth it?Personally, I agree with proponents of the DEA approach that it is a more objective ranking and selecting suppliers than the traditional method. I also feel that it has a stronger logic for objectively determining the ‘best’ supplier.However, its key weakness is in the implementation:Time and effort to implement: Calculating the optimised weights is cumbersome in Excel (the optimal weights need to be solved individually for each supplier). This is unsustainable for a large number of suppliers but open source programs (e.g. the Python PuLP package) or optimization software can streamline this process.

Math & Justice: Sheila Warren | GP Interview #14,https://medium.com/good-people-dinners/math-justice-sheila-warren-gp-interview-14-6b76f4c82b5f?source=tag_archive---------5-----------------------,"Mathematics,Education,Justice,Interview,Economics","This is the fourteenth in a series of written interviews with thinkers, artists, activists and other luminaries around the world, people whose life’s work resonates with our founding principles.A combination of unicorn and cheetah with a corona of sparkles, Sheila WarrenOur friend Sheila Warren serves as head of blockchain, data and digital assets at The World Economic Forum (WEF). She also serves on WEF’s executive committee and previously was general counsel at Tech Soup, where she is now a board member. Sheila has one of the most vigorous and curious minds you will ever encounter and her interests are always broad and evolving. She has spoken previously at GP Dinners focused on her habits as a lifelong bibliophile and currently serves as a board member at the ACLU of Northern California and the Equal Justice Society.Our conversation this time around looks at identity formation and the activities her three children are picking up. When do we speak of ourselves in terms of verbs and when as nouns, and how might this unlock or manifest our potential as we mature?GP: Maybe we can start with how you see mathematics being taught to your kids and how this differs from the ways you or I may have learned math back in the last century?SW: What I observe is that the practical application of mathematics is being emphasized beyond the random word problems I did as a kid, whether through connection to nature, science, or art.Math education is much more than the times tables we all drilled over and over.Our kids went (or will go) to Montessori preschool, which makes math concepts literally tangible. We’ve also explored abacus math, which engages the right brain. But I personally think that math is absolutely stunningly beautiful, and that sense of wonder is something I want all my kids to experience. My preschooler just figured out last night that 1+4 = 4+1 = 2+3 = 3+2 = 5, and watching her manipulate her five fingers and laugh in delight is something I will never forget. I don’t remember having a similar experience until much, much later in life.Image courtesy Jeswin Thomas, UnsplashGP: How do you see math in relation to social justice and identity development? What does it mean to be a mathematician in service of equity? Can you tell us a little about the math group you are a part of on Facebook?SW: The private group I randomly got invited into focuses on how to decolonize mathematics, and I had never thought about that apart from issues with the SATs and other standardized tests.It’s been a rabbit hole par excellence, especially in the context of this summer. Even though my work focuses to a great degree on equity in tech, and I spend A LOT of time thinking about systemic racism, I had never really considered how MATH might be a tool of oppression, or conversely, of liberation! I’m still in sponge mode on this, but suffice it to say that I am 100% convinced that this is an area to which more people should be paying attention.GP: From solving problems or “doing” arithmetic to switching hats, sometimes being a mathematician, sometimes a reader or a dancer or a chef. Verbs and nouns. How do you speak about these activities to your kids and how has this caused you perhaps to re-evaluate how you and Nikhil relate to each other and other adults? How do we move from the rarified or esoteric to the everyday in fields like mathematics?SW: It was a real eye-opener to realize that while I regularly describe my kids as “readers” or “dancers” or “scientists,” or even talk about their “engineering brain” or their “creative brain,” I had never talked to them about being mathematicians. Even though we use our “math brains” all the time, like when we bake, or build, or ride our bikes! It took me a few tries to get that phrase to roll off the tongue as smoothly, which started me thinking about why that might be. I never struggled with math in school, and I even took math in college after it was required. But I never identified as a mathematician. Math was something I did, not part of my identity. We know that self-identification as “good” or “bad” at math, especially for girls, happens very young and paves the way for eventual mastery of a particular area. And if you grow up thinking of mathematics (or whatever) as accessible, it creates a confidence I think is invaluable. I am still not quite able to refer to myself as a mathematician, but I do talk about using my “math brain,” and I try to notice the many ways math shows up for me in everyday life and celebrate that.Image courtesy Gayatri Malhotra, UnsplashGP: Math is the basis for law and for coding and other vital fields of knowledge that shape our everyday lives. Can we all become better mathematicians, or are we somehow already? I certainly have always felt nervous and inadequate around math. Is there a trick to shifting my perspective to embrace this field of knowledge?SW: I think there’s an imposter syndrome that most people of mine or older generations have when it comes to math.We were taught that math was something you wrangle with, or wrestle into submission, when in reality math is the gateway to a broader understanding of the human condition. It is something we engage with every single day. Once you shift out of an arithmetic model, and think about math more generally, you start to realize that math is everywhere. I think this mental shift is the key, more than any sort of enhanced numerical or geometric fluency.GP: How does your work at WEF reflect the values that have driven your career since you left the east coast? If your current efforts were wildly successful, what might change about how our world operates?  SW: I’d say my work reflects lifelong values for me.Even when I worked crazy hours at a white shoe wall street law firm, I volunteered a ton of time to local after-school programs, adult literacy programs, and took on pro bono projects.My paid work now is itself more in line with my values, and I’ve shifted from direct volunteering to nonprofit Board service, but social justice remains deeply important to me. I imagine a world full of systems that meet the needs of more people and reflect a model of inclusive stakeholder engagement rather than extractive shareholder capitalism.Sheila at the World Economic Forum in Davos, SwitzerlandGP: Can you succinctly describe the most positive impact that blockchain or Distributed Ledger Technologies could have in our world?SW: When it comes to blockchain, I am a pragmatic optimist. I think many if not most of our systems will wind up ultimately being blockchain-backed, but I think that will take quite some time.I am bullish on cryptocurrencies, as a general matter, but I think that the idea that ONE cryptocurrency will beat out all the others doesn’t make a ton of sense. As with any tech, you have to look at fitness for purpose, and there are many purposes.GP: How are you, your family and friends holding up given the new realities of the pandemic and the new precautions we’re all taking? Are you able to find time for friends, even at a distance?SW: In a word, no. Something had to give, and that thing was my social life. It is what it is.I’m grateful that my family is happy and healthy, and we are embracing the chaos and finding many moments of pure joy with the kids. It has been a blessing watching the relationships between my kids grow and strengthen during this period. I can’t complain!GP: Looking at the global landscape of philanthropy and impact capital, what areas give you the most hope? What areas most concern or worry you?SW: I am DEEPLY concerned about the state of philanthropy. It bothers me a lot that only a handful of funders seem to understand the need for big bets and sustained campaigns that accommodate a lot of failed experiments. I don’t like the fail fast model as applied to philanthropy, because a lot of social change requires mindset shifts or systems change that can take a loooong time.In parallel, as society (particularly in the US) came to rely less and less on government to support basic needs, we saw philanthropic capital swoop in to fill gaps. This then resulted in some actors in government claiming that certain social services (for example) were no longer necessary.But what happens if funders change their minds? As someone who used to represent various family philanthropies, I have seen firsthand that each generation has their pet causes. I am frankly terrified that we have already backed ourselves into a space where we are so reliant on philanthropic capital to function that we are one or two deaths away from collapse of certain sectors.GP: Will the United States be able to return to a position of coalition building and leadership in the world, or have the current administration’s isolationism and saber rattling made the road back too hard?SW: I certainly would have thought that this particular period of time would have killed off the concept of American exceptionalism, but it clearly hasn’t.The gross mismanagement of the pandemic could well turn out to be the nail in the coffin in terms of the world’s respect for us, with pity flowing in to fill the vacuum. Suffice it to say that the president who follows this one has a very, very tough road ahead.Good People DinnersGP is a community built around meaningful conversations and farm to table feasts.Follow196 MathematicsEducationJusticeInterviewEconomics196 claps196 clapsWritten byRaman FreyFollowGood People and Meaningful Conversations www.ramanfrey.comFollowGood People DinnersFollowGood People is a community built around meaningful conversations & farm to table feasts, a moveable social club for those who value authenticity, stronger connections w/each other.

The life and work of the Man who knew Infinity,https://medium.com/@aditya.syam/the-life-and-work-of-the-man-who-knew-infinity-93569b449b83?source=tag_archive---------7-----------------------,"Ramanujan,Mathematics,Srinivasa Ramanujan,Cambridge University,Indian Mathematics","In the modern era, few names related to academia command as much respect and inspire as much awe as does the name of Srinivasa Ramanujan. Arguably one of the greatest Indian mathematicians of all time, he was a man from a poor family under the British Rule in Southern India who had no formal mathematical training and yet ended up pursuing pure mathematics at Cambridge and being inducted as a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS). The only things which made this possible were his genius and his love for mathematics.Ramanujan was born in 1887 as Srinivasa Ramanujan Aiyangar in a Brahmin family in the erstwhile Madras Presidency. He showed genius from a young age and secured the highest marks in the district in multiple subjects in the primary examination. However, as his interest in mathematics grew, he started to neglect other subjects. At age 15, he somehow got his hands on a copy of the book ‘Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics’. This book contained thousands of mathematical results and theorems with almost no proof. Ramanujan was so absorbed in the book and his great love for mathematics that he barely studied other subjects and failed his higher examinations in both school and college.Despite his worrisome state, Ramanujan somehow managed to make ends meet. His first break in mathematics came when the Indian mathematician Ramachandra Rao helped him publish his first paper on Bernoulli numbers in the Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society. Ramanujan’s work was so incredibly intuitive and his ideas so abstract, lacking the rigorous proof considered a prerequisite in academia, that it eluded the understanding of many academics at the time. Some even considered him to be a fraud.Ramanujan started writing letters to Cambridge University, initially to no avail. However, on the third try, his letter reached G. H. Hardy. Hardy was amazed by Ramanujan’s work and papers and said that he had “never seen anything in the least like them before”. He immediately arranged for Ramanujan to travel to Cambridge. Starting in 1914, Ramanujan began working with Hardy on mathematical research, much of which was developed with a combination of Ramanujan’s uncanny intuition and brilliance and Hardy’s skill at rigorous mathematical proof. Ramanujan was not well versed with modern developments in mathematics but his mastery with continued fractions and his work on the Riemann series, elliptical integrals, the hypergeometric series, the zeta function, and divergent series had no parallel. His collaboration with Hardy on the partition of numbers was ground-breaking.Ramanujan’s work was published across British and European journals. In 1918, he was elected to the Royal Society of London. At the time, Hardy had commented “I have never met his equal and can compare him only with Euler or Jacobi”. Eventually, his health deteriorated in England and he returned to India, where he passed away in 1920 at the age of only 32. The early demise of such a great mind was a significant loss for the field of mathematics. He left behind three notebooks with a treasure of mathematical work and ideas which academics continue to analyse and verify to this day. A journal called ‘The Ramanujan Journal’ was published in 1997 which focuses on areas of mathematics which have been influenced by the genius of Srinivasa Ramanujan.Written byAditya SyamFollow3 3 3 RamanujanMathematicsSrinivasa RamanujanCambridge UniversityIndian MathematicsMore from Aditya SyamFollowMore From MediumThe Triumph of MediocrityBryan Tan in Cantor’s ParadiseTwo Myths about Math We Need to ForgetMurtaza Ali in Age of AwarenessStatistic — Distributions of Discrete random variablesBu YifanStarter Guide to Factoring Quadratics & PolynomialsBrett Berry in Math HacksLeetCode’s 132 Problem ExplainedSaloni KaurLearning more about functions/methods using *gasp* MATH!Bryan MullerMind vs. Machine: A Philosophical Corollary of Gödel’s Incompleteness TheoremJan Gronwald in Cantor’s ParadiseA Beginner’s Guide to AlgorithmsJeffrey Ogah in The StartupAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"

God doesn’t roll dice!,https://medium.com/mathemagic/god-doesnt-roll-dice-358b98872d14?source=tag_archive---------10-----------------------,"Math,Mathematics,Probability,Logic,Logical Thinking","Consider a game where you have a standard dice with numbers from 1 to 6 and also consider the usual activity of rolling such a dice. Eventually, you will roll a number that has already appeared before in the sequence. For example, if I roll the dice and get the sequence 4, 5, 1, 6, 1 then I repeated the number 1 on the 5th roll of the dice.So the question here is how many rolls would it take for you to roll a repeat?. For those of you who are familiar with probability and statistics, the question would be better stated as to “ What is the number of expected rolls till the dice repeats one of the numbers? “What is ‘Expected Value’?Mathematically it’s defined the ‘ weighted average value of a random variable over a large number of independent experiments’. A random variable, in turn, is a variable that maps numbers to possible outcomes in an experiment. Confused?Let’s consider a simple experiment — tossing a fair coin. The outcomes are either Head or Tail, each with an equal probability of 0.5Let’s have a random variable X that is equal to 0 when we toss head, and 1 when we toss a tail. Hence for this random variable, the expected value, or E(X) is nothing but 0*0.5 + 1*0.5 = 0.5Consider the example of dice, and take the random variable X as the number appearing on the top of the dice after a roll. This number can be anywhere between 1 and 6, including them, and each number has an equal probability of 1/6 on appearing on top of the dice.Hence in this case,E(X) = 1*(1/6) + 2*(1/6) + 3*(1/6) + 4*(1/6) + 5*(1/6) + 6*(1/6) = 21/6 = 3.5Well if you’re extremely lucky (or if you have been playing some board games this quarantine), you might observe the repetition in the second roll itself, for example, you might get [6,6] in the first two trials. But the problem is a more general question, as in what are the expected number of rolls before you may repeat a number.As we saw here, it can happen in 2 rolls at a minimum. Is there an upper bound on this one as well? Yes! As we can say the 7th roll would be a repeated number. Even when you get all different numbers in the first 6 rolls, you would definitely get repetition in the 7th roll. Thus, the 7th roll will always be a repetition, but there is a possibility that it’s not the first one. Of course, we can get repetition in rolls < 7 just that now our answer is bound within 2 and 7Let’s backtrack our way up to the solution, and let’s also consider E(x) as the ‘ expected number of rolls required to observe a repetition after we have seen x numbers before’. Hence our initial question would require us to calculate E(0) as we need to calculate the number of rolls required to get repetition, even before we have rolled any dice.For this logic, we would have E(6) = 1 as when we have seen 6 numbers already, a single roll would bring us a number that has already appeared in the sequence before.Now coming on to E(5) we see thatE(5) = (5/6)*1 + (1/6)*(1+E(6))This means that we have a 5/6 chance of rolling a number that is equal to the five numbers occurred before and would not need another roll and we have a 1/6 chance of rolling a sixth number, after which we would need the expected number of rolls required to observe a repetition, given we have seen 6 numbers, which is already shown before as E(6) = 1Therefore,Looking at E(4), we see that there is a 4/6 chance of rolling a number we have seen before and 2/6 chance of rolling one that we haven’tHence,E(4) = (4/6)*1 + (2/6)*(1+ E(5))We see a recurring pattern that is -E(x) = (x/6)*1 + {(6-x)/6}*(1+E(x-1))Using this, we calculateAnd finally,Hence, when we start out with nothing, or when we haven’t seen any number before, the expected number of dice rolls that would be required to get a repetition is 3.77.I hope you liked this week’s newsletter.

An Additive Game,https://medium.com/@newtonmigosi/an-additive-game-part-i-b8a6a2935ae3?source=tag_archive---------13-----------------------,"Mathematics,Logic,Puzzle,Cards Game","A deck of poker cards.Here’s a game four people can play using a deck of poker cards.Split the deck by suit and give one to each player.Have every player return their Queen card.Let the game begin!The objective of this game is to arrange your suit along the edges of a 4x4 square where every edge sums up to 23. For the purposes of our game we’ll take the Ace to have a value of one, the Jack to have a value of eleven and the King to have a value of thirteen.Getting StartedAn initial approach would be to first lay out the cards randomly and inspect them to see whether they match the description. That would look something like this:A possible (though incorrect) arrangement.Now to calculate our sums:Top edge: 2+10+13+11=36Left edge: 2+8+6+5=21Bottom edge: 5+3+1+7=16Right edge: 11+9+4+7=31Unfortunately, none of our edges sum up to exactly 23. But we can try to swap cards between edges to get a correct arrangement. With a bit of luck this works out for us after performing the following swaps:Swap K and ASwap 9 and 10Swap 10 and 8Swap K and 8Swap J and ASwap 3 and 7Swap 4 and 6Swap 5 and 7We end up with an arrangement that looks like this:A solution to the Add23 Puzzle.At each step I try to make a single edge get closer to 23 by swapping out its cards with those from another edge.Taking it FurtherNow, we could be satisfied with our solution and leave it at that. But where’s the fun in that! Are there other solutions? Is it possible to generate all of them? Answering these questions would require a different approach to the puzzle.We’ll get to this in the Part II and do a deeper analysis of the puzzle.

Friends and Numbers,https://medium.com/mathemagic/friends-and-numbers-3d0cdd6673c3?source=tag_archive---------14-----------------------,"Math,Mathematics,Puzzle,Logic,Logical Reasoning","The question begins with three friends Jim, Dwight and Michael sitting together. Jim asks Michael to randomly choose 2 numbers between 1 and 9 (both inclusive, and repetition allowed). Now Michael tells Jim the sum of the numbers he chose, and then proceeds to tell Dwight the product of the two numbers. The conversation between Jim and Dwight is now as follows:Jim : I don’t know which two numbers Michael had picked, but I am sure that you (Dwight) don’t know either.Dwight : I don’t know either at first but I know now. I also know that my showed result is greater than yours.Jim : Then I know these numbers now.Now the question is that what are the two numbers?Solution:Let X be the sum of the two numbers and Y be the product of the same. From the problem definition we can see that X can range from anywhere between 2 and 18, and similarly Y can range from anywhere between 1 and 81. Let’s jot down the assumptions from the statements first -Jim doesn’t know the numbers Michael had picked, this means that X can be written in more ways than one, for example the number 10 can be written as 5 + 5, or 6 + 4 and so on. This eliminates the possibility of X being 2, 3, 17 and 18 as they can only be expressed as (1+1), (1+2), (8+9) and (9+9) respectively.We also know that Dwight doesn’t know, meaning that the product can be represented with multiple sets of numbers, for example 8 = (4 x 2) and also (8 x 1)Having said that, let’s backtrack our ways upto the solution. Remember that when Dwight says that he knows now and his result is greater than Jim’s (Y > X), we see that Jim immediately responds that he knows now. This means that there was a possibility of having only two options, one where X > Y and the other where Y > X, and since Dwight clarified the latter, X > Y is not true.Carefully observing, we find that the sum (X) can only be greater that (Y) when we have a pairing of (1, num) where X = 1 + num > Y = num x 1 = num. This limits the range of X being < or equal to 10 (from (1,3) to (1,9)) Remember we eliminated 2 and 3 before.Now, we also know that for a given X between 4 and 10, there exist only two different representations of X as (1 + num) or (a + b) and nothing else. This in turn eliminates X greater than or equal to 6, since every number upwards from 6 can be represented by 3 or more such pairs described above.Hence, we are left with only two options that either X = 4 or X = 5. If X was 4, then apart from (1,3), the only pair we have is (2,2) and that isn’t possible because for that case, Y is not greater that X, as stated by Dwight. The only available option is therefore X = 5, with the pairing (2,3) which satisfies Y > X.Answer -Numbers are 2 and 3.mathemagicSeemingly challenging problems in math and logic (simplified)FollowMathMathematicsPuzzleLogicLogical ReasoningWritten byVatsalya TandonFollowFollowmathemagicFollowThis blog is about curating interesting math/logic content, something that we have always loved.

Birthday Puzzle,https://medium.com/mathemagic/birthday-puzzle-63246e94c522?source=tag_archive---------15-----------------------,"Puzzle,Mathematics,Logic,Probability,Statistics","ProblemLet’s say you go to a research conference with some other people. There are a total of n people in the room. You are really bored after a while, and start off thinking about birthdays! You want to find out what number of people share the same birthday, or better still, share it with you.Assuming that these people are randomly chosen and have birthdays which can be equally likely on any day of the year. You need to find the probability that two people selected randomly share the same birthday. As an addition, you also want to find out what is the probability that someone shares the same birthday as you! This would be a function of n, and let’s try to see what is the value of the probability as n changes. For example, what should be the value of n for this probability to be greater than half?SolutionLet’s just disregard that some variations in the distribution such as leap years, twins, weekly variations, etc. since that just complicates the problem but does not change the main idea of it.From the pigeonhole principle, (fancy name for a simple idea), if n>365, then there definitely are two people at the conference with the same birthday. This is simple, but what about n=365 or slightly less?At first glance, it seems that due to the number of birthdays possible, the required n would be large. Let’s try to mathematically formulate the problem now:We need to compute P(n) which is the probability that at least two people in a room of n people have the same birthday. However, it is simpler to calculate P(n’), the probability that no two people in that room have the same birthday. These two possibilities are mutually exclusive, and can never occur at the same time. Hence, both add up to one.Let’s say the first person has a birthday on day x, then the second person should not have a birthday on that day. This can occur with a probability of 364/365 since he can select any of the other 364 days. Similarly, the third person cannot select any of the already selected 2 days and is left with 363/365. Hence, for any generic person who comes to select at place i, he will not have i-1 places left for him. The probability for him to select a day, such that there are no common birthdays would be (366-i)/365.Multiplying them together, we will get:This looks like a complicated equation, hence we can just use some code to plot the graph corresponding to this. This is the plot of the probability that two people share a birthday as a function of n, (effectively plotting 1-P(n'))You can see from here that for the probability to be greater than 0.5, you need only 23 people in the room! There are some interesting approximations which can be derived using Taylor series/Poisson approximation for the above formula, which makes it easier to handle the calculation in an interview! (Head to this)What if you want to find a person who has the same birthday as you? What would be the answer then? Note that in the above question, neither of the two people are chosen in advance. The probability that no one has the same birthday as you would be: (364/365)^n. Thus, for any general n, the probability is:Putting in n=23, which we got from the above question, we get a probability of 6.12% only! You need around 220 people for even cross the 50% barrier, which is 10 times more hard. Plotting this alongside the previous curve, we get:Looks like the probability for someone to share the birthday with you is very less, even when there are a lot of people!Hope you liked this puzzle!

We have two numbers one is XYZ and the other is ZYX. And we add these two numbers and get ZX0.So here is the question, that what is the value of X, Y, and Z, such as that X, Y, Z>0?…………………….. Solution………………………..1st we look to this part. We can see that sum of Z and Y is 0, it means it should be 10, it should not be 20, 30 or any number which ends with 0 because the max value of Z and Y should 9, therefore, Z+Y will be 18  And min value of Z and Y should be 1 therefore the sum will be 2, So here is only one possible number 10 which has 0 as the last digit.Therefore Z+Y=10. And we sift the carry here.So, 1+Y+Z=X, but as we know the value of Z+Y, so we just put the value here. And we get X=11, therefore we take the rightmost digit as the value of X. so x=1.And again we sift the carry to here, therefore 1+X+Y= Z, as we already know the value of X therefore we put the value of X here. So we get Z-Y=2.till now we have got 3 equations, so by solving the 1st and 3rd equation we can easily find the value of Z and Y, so we get Z=6 and Y=4.Therefore we get, X=1, Y=4, and Z=6.So the two numbers are 146 and 464 and their sum is 610.so that’s it for today guys if you like this story then like this story, if you want to send me some problem then you are most well come.

What is the Axiom of Choice?,https://medium.com/cantors-paradise/what-is-the-axiom-of-choice-61347a0287c?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Math,Mathematics,Computer Science,Programming,Education","Here’s a fun 2-minute guide to the infamous Axiom of Choice, one of the stranger mathematical curiosities.By Fschwarzentruber — Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=48219447What is the Axiom of Choice?The short answer, not at all rigorous answer, is that the axiom of choice allows mathematicians to extract elements from an infinite number of infinitely large sets at once. This turns out to be very important, because mathematicians are very fond indeed of making infinite-sized things, and even more fond of being able to formalise their manipulations of infinite-sized things.But let’s dig a little deeper.The axiom of choice allows us to pick elements from ‘indexed sets’. When dealing with ‘finite things’, this seems kinda obvious. For instance, if A={1,2,3}, B={3,4,5}, and C={5,6}, then it is easy to pick an element from each. Just pick, say, 1 from A, 3 from B, and 6 from C. In fact, if you only every deal with finite sets (e.g. dealing with finite numbers, finite graphs, a finite number of people, etc…), then you will never need the Axiom of Choice. That includes lots of interesting maths, from computer science to graph theory. And it probably includes everything in the real world.But, Mathematicians don’t want to be constrained to the finite. How very dull it would be if we couldn’t make nearly as many weird and wonderful mathematical objects as our imagination allowed, while keeping coherency through the use of sensible axioms.Now, imagine we have a bag filled with sets, and there are an infinite number of sets in the bag. The Axiom of Choice tells us that there is a set containing an element from each of the sets in the bag. Basically, this allows us to meaningfully extract elements from infinitely large collections of sets. In fact, it allows us to do this even if each set contains an infinite number of elements themselves! As those sets are often characterised by some property, the elements we get ‘chosen’ for us by the Axiom of Choice will often have structure we can exploit!Why(!!) the Axiom of Choice?I start this section with a quote from an answer on MathOverflow, titled “How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Axiom of Choice”. See here.The universe can be very a strange place without choice. One consequence of the Axiom of Choice is that when you partition a set into disjoint nonempty parts, then the number of parts does not exceed the number of elements of the set being partitioned. This can fail without the Axiom of Choice.*That answer was written by the mysteriously named Dr strangechoice*What does this mean? It means that you can take a set, distribute all of its elements into different parts, and end up with more parts than you have elements. Imagine taking a set of different sweets, all of different colours, putting two in each bag, and ending up with more bags than sweets!Without the Axiom of Choice, a lot of things fall apart, and rather quickly.We require the Axiom of Choice to determine cardinalities. If you remove the Axiom of Choice, then it is consistent that the real numbers can be written as a countable union of countable sets.What if we want to sensible deal with ‘large’ vector spaces. In R³ we can construct a ‘basis’ for the space, so that any point can be written as a linear combination of 3 components (e.g., 3 across , 2 up, 4 along, where ‘across’, ‘up’, ‘along’ are our ‘basis’). This requires a Hamel basis, (which I constructed here during lockdown), which is the equivalent of a basis from our standard 3-Dimensional space, but for an infinite-dimensional vector space.Oh, and it is possible that the reals can be written as the union of two sets which are smaller cardinalities. That’s basically heresy! This would make a nonsense of comparing the sizes of infinitely large sets.Is the Axiom of Choice even true?… is the wrong way to look at it.It has been proven that the Axiom of Choice is consistent with the other axioms of set theory, but so its negation. I.e. we don’t need to worry about it messing up our consistency with the apparatus we use for finite sets.The Axiom of Choice extends what we are comfortable doing with finite sets, is consistent with the other axioms, and makes a vast amount of mathematics work, and much of this mathematics is extremely useful.If you are looking for some kind of Platonist truth, then I think you are barking up the wrong tree. It is better to view mathematics as structure, much of which parallels the real world (such as Euclidean geometry giving real insights into objects which aren’t actually 2D and have perfectly smooth edges), rather than necessarily being some necessarily true statements.It works and underpins the mathematical objects we use to talk about probabilities, particle physics, and more.Jerry Bona put it: “The Axiom of Choice is obviously true, the well-ordering principle obviously false, and who can tell about Zorn’s Lemma”. The *joke* is that these three principles all imply each other; yet mathematicians have very different intuitions about whether they should be true.In any case…In any case, I’ve ‘stopped worrying, and learned to love the axiom of choice’. Perhaps when in a few years after learning more about the foundations of mathematics, I’ll be sufficiently spooked out to reconsider :)P.S.

A Message for Undergraduates,https://towardsdatascience.com/a-message-for-undergraduates-6fd16caa1da1?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Machine Learning,Statistics,Mathematics,Computer Science,Data Science","Photo by Joshua Hoehne on UnsplashYou’re an undergraduate. Either you’re graduating soon (like me) or you’re in the process of getting your first college degree. The process is not easy and I can only assume how difficult the pressures on Masters and Ph.D. students are. However, I have no clue about this, so it will not be my topic of focus. You could easily make the argument that I’m writing this for myself — that would be partially true. I still want to send this message out regardless. Applying to jobs in the Machine Learning field is not easy. Anyone who tells you otherwise did not work half as hard as you are working right now.Being Objective:Getting an undergraduate degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or any technical field related to Data Science and Machine Learning is an excellent way to get your foot in the door. Typically, you’re expected to have some form of internship or research experience during your four years in college. Getting experience afterwards is just as great. But when I talk about being objective of yourself, it’s not necessarily about your experience.I am a rising senior in my university. This means I have less than a year left to graduate with a BS in Statistics. I constantly look back to myself as a sophomore taking my first upper division Statistics class — Analysis of Variance. When my professor was discussing how to find the overall sample mean, I saw a double summation for the first time in my entire life. I almost had a panic attack. This was the equation:Image by AuthorNow, you may be looking at this equation thinking that it is very intuitive. It really is. However, I will never shake the feeling I got when I first saw this equation. It was a feeling of not being mathematically savvy enough to understand a double summation. It was a feeling of being behind in the class despite starting it no more than two weeks before seeing the equation. It was a feeling of failure. Isn’t that a lot of feelings for an equation like this? It really is.I was 19 when I saw my first double summation and here I am now, a little less than two years later at 21, developing a thesis that requires me to know about two fields I have no formal education in. In a little less than two years, I went from being scared of equations to not getting enough of them. Now, I look back at myself taking this class and I can understand my feelings objectively. As a new student, I was seeing many concepts for the first time, so it makes sense that I was intimidated by a formula like this. As an undergraduate, you will be expected to see many (and I mean many) new concepts you have never seen or thought of in your entire life. Many of these concepts will fascinate you endlessly and fit perfectly in how you interpret the world. Many more of these concepts will break the way you think and leave you stumped for days, weeks, and sometimes even semesters to understand them (side note: if you are ever this confused about a concept talk to your professor and TA. If that still does not help YouTube has always gotten my back.)If you cannot recognize the growth you have made in the past few years, you cannot recognize the growth you are bound to make in the future. What are your goals? How do you plan on achieving your goals? Looking at yourself objectively reminds you that you are not expected to know everything from the get-go. Being an undergraduate comes with a very significant implication: you are new in the field. This is far from a bad thing. In fact, it is only a bad thing if you think it is. Begin to recognize that you are beginning your journey down a path you chose for yourself. Begin to recognize that what you do not know now is not representative of your knowledge and potential in the future. Begin to recognize that the malleability in your knowledge can be used to make you a superstar — you just have to see it for yourself.Written byAdam SabraAspiring audio and deep learning researcher. || https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-sabra/ || asabra.comFollow9 Sign up for The Daily PickBy Towards Data ScienceHands-on real-world examples, research,  tutorials, and cutting-edge techniques delivered Monday to Thursday.

Importance of Mathematics,https://medium.com/the-felix-exitus/importance-of-mathematics-9400eae72a9a?source=tag_archive---------2-----------------------,"Mathematics,Education,Thefelixexitus,Interesting,Research","It seems natural that the majority of the population knows almost nothing about mathematics and that their relation to math is limited to the four rules. This distance contrasts with the importance of mathematics today in society.Mathematics is at the center of our culture and its history is often confused with that of philosophy. Just as the cosmological and evolution theories have exerted considerable influence on the conception that humans have of ourselves, the non-Euclidean geometries have allowed new ideas about the universe and theorems of mathematical logic have revealed the limitations of the deductive method.There is also mathematics in art. Since Pythagoras, the most famous mathematician, discovered numerical reasons in musical harmony, the relationship between mathematics and art has been permanent. These aspects of mathematics make them a bridge between the humanities and the natural sciences, between the two cultures.Mathematics has a number of very useful benefits to our mind if we go into its study. It develops our reasoning, helps us to have analytical thinking, quickens our mind, generates practicality and also its use can be applied in the day to day.The mathematics is present in our daily lives. For many students, math is boring, abstract, lacking in creativity, complex and very difficult to understand, hence the typical expressions of “I am of letters” or “Numbers are not mine.” However, it is a subject that is part of the study of our children and as such should be an effort for compression, which usually involves constant practice.If you think that you are not able to help your child with mathematics, lessons from a math tutor, in that case, would be the right solution. In addition to the knowledge that these professionals have, they also know the methodological procedures in the transfer of knowledge, and that is very important.As boring as math may seem, her study translates into benefits for education and for our life in general as:Math helps us to have analytical thinking. We could define it as the thought directed to decompose the arguments in its premises or expressions that compose it, to see the relations that exist between them and their conclusion, in order to judge its veracity or reliability of the same. This is what we do when we do a mathematical problem: collect the data, break down its premises, observe the relations that keep or systematically solve their parts in a rational way. If we are able to understand mathematics and arrive at logical solutions, we will be able to prepare our minds when we have real problems. We can look for the best logic, see the possible solutions and relate the data we have to reach the conclusion.Analytical thinking develops the ability to investigate and know the truth about the world around us. There are truths that we try to look for and that are based on the evidence and not on the emotions. It is a thought that allows us to be alert for error both ourselves and others, to deception and manipulation. This is possible because mathematics allows us to reason clearly and logically, taking into account real data and that can be verified.Mathematics develops the ability to think because to find the solutions, you have to think of a whole coherent process. It could be said that mathematics is fundamental in the education of children since math teaches them to think.Thanks to mathematics, we can explain how things work, that is, we can express our thoughts and ideas with clarity, coherence, and precision. This is fundamental and very positive so that all the others understand us and know that we are people with a clear and coherent thought. Our way of ordering ideas and expressing them correctly is a big part of our image.Mathematics promotes wisdom. Mathematics applies to other sciences as in new technologies and it is very present in our life. In fact, many of the phenomena of our daily life are governed by the exact sciences. The teaching of mathematics helps and enables students to be able to reach their own convictions, as it teaches them that to solve a problem must reach the truth, which there is no doubt because it is objective and logical.Mathematics quickens our minds and helps us, in general, to deepen and think when we are faced with complex problems. Our life is composed largely of situations of choice, approach, reasoning and facing problems to which solutions have to be found. In that sense, mathematics helps you to open your mind and to understand that there is only one way to solve things. It is to investigate and finally conclude.When it comes to education, one of the biggest problems today is that high school students do not take mathematics seriously enough. They are simply not interested in this subject, despite the fact that this structural science can provide them well-paid jobs in engineering, statistics, education, and technology.Teenagers see mathematics as something boring, difficult and irrelevant to their lives, and do not take into account all the benefits that math can provide them in the future, such as a bigger college choice, or as we have mentioned, a great paying job in the profession.follow me on quora for more :-We bring you another 7 reasons why your child should be concerned with math and why is it important for his future:Math makes your child smarter. Mathematics for learning is the same as the strength and durability for sport: basis that allows your child to surpass others and himself. Your child cannot become a big sports star if he is not strong and has problems with his health. Your child cannot become an authority in his work or prominent in his profession one day, if he doesn’t think smart and critically — and math, to a large extent, can help him with that.Can make money with math. Let’s face it, not every child is predestined to be the winner of X-factor or a similar project. Even those who for a short time cannot afford to enjoy the glory and thus secure a bright future, usually, after a while, they return to school in order to finish up some education and to build their careers. Convince your child to skip several auditions and several sports games, and instead of that to do his math homework. Therefore, you will give him enough support to secure a job that will bring him a bright future and a stable income, more stable than singers and sports stars can earn for a living. Maybe this is not the case at the outset of his career, but it is certainly realistic to think so.Mathematics is essential in order not to lose money. When a bunch of credulous people spends money on various pyramid schemes, thinking that they will make a fortune, they do so primarily because their math is not their strongest side. In particular, if you are the least bit familiar with statistics and calculations of interest, in a very easy way you will recognize the economic fraud and sellers of fog. With the help of science like mathematics, you will avoid a waste of money on various projects and tips that you believe can help you.Math can provide your child with a ticket to the world. Global human consciousness is changing the world we live in. Clever children from Eastern Europe, India and China are considering mathematics and other “heavy” science as their ticket out of poverty and social degradation. Don’t you think that even your child can acquire knowledge that is payable everywhere in the world in a very wide range of occupations?buy my bookMathematics is essential in a world of constant change. New technologies are changing the way we work and live. If you don’t want your child to use some instructions or constantly pay professionals in order not to be scared to press the wrong button, mathematics can be very useful in understanding how and why things work the way they work.Math will be more represented in the future. Whether we like that or not, math is becoming an increasingly important factor in a variety of industries. Future journalists and politicians will speak less and analyze more. Future police and military personnel will use technology that is certainly an invention of scientists. Teachers and nurses will also rely on numbers and technology. Future mechanics and carpenters will use optimization electronics and analysis as much as they will use a hammer and a wrench.Math makes up a large part of our everyday life. As a parent, you are bound to draw attention to your child all the advantages that this course provides. Of course, not everybody needs to become a mathematician or engineer, but this science can provide a bright future for your child can help him in the huge number of life situations to think critically, analyze and to bring the best possible decision.you get in life what you have courage to ask forTo experience all these opportunities that mathematics provides, first, you need to help your child to love mathematics. Do everything in your power to help your child to love math.KUSH GUPTAsource :-The unseen mathematical problemsimportance of mathematicsThe Felix ExitusBringing infinity with a vision to changeFollow51 MathematicsEducationThefelixexitusInterestingResearch51 claps51 clapsWritten byKush GuptaFollowStudent | Author | Human | Artist | Founder More than 1M+ views across platforms.

2 + 2 = Intellectual Insanity,https://medium.com/the-innovation/2-2-intellectual-insanity-afbadc00b15e?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"Mathematics,Math,Politics,Racism,Psychology","I recently learned about “mathgate,” the fiasco of a debate over the answer to 2 + 2. Apparently, the answer to this question — 4, by the way, that is the only answer — has become controversial as it is somehow representative of white supremacy.If this assertion strikes you as inane, that’s because it is. It is not only fundamentally at odds with the physical laws that govern our universe, it is profoundly ignorant of the history of mathematics, which, by the way, predates western imperialism and colonialism by millennia. This is not a “woke” perspective. It is more like sleepwalking blindfolded.As is the case with any science whose laws are universal, mathematics was pursued and furthered by thinkers across the ancient world from China and India to Iran and the Middle East to Egypt, Greece, and Rome. The concept of zero, for example, dates back over 5,000 years to ancient Sumer, and then spread around the globe since math, unlike Chinese, Hindi, Arabic, or English, is — again — universal, and can be understood in any language.According to Encyclopedia Brittanica, it was Muslim mathematician Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī who introduced algebra to European. In fact, the word algebra itself is simply the Latinized version of al-Khwārizmī’s name. The brown, Muslim origins of this white imperialist construct are immortalized in the name of this particular field of math.The irony of promoting the ludicrous concept of mathematics as a vehicle of white supremacy is that it overlooks the abundant contributions of people who were very much not white. Individuals such as al-Khwārizmī or Hemiunu, the likely architect of Khufu’s great pyramids. Those pyramids, by the way, are the only of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World left standing. The Egyptian architect who died circa 2750 BCE designed a longer-lasting edifice than any of his contemporaries and he did so literally thousands of years before the Greeks or Roman intellectual traditions rose to prominence.Regarding pyramids, one might be curious how it could be the case that both the ancient Egyptians and the Mayans could design and build these structures without being granted the gift of math from the white man. The answer is quite simple: geometry, another universal form of mathematics that non-white people discovered and used independently. Without geometry, the only explanation for pyramids in both Egypt and Mexico becomes ancient aliens.Speaking of aliens, it is also worth considering how SETI, the organization that looks for intelligent life elsewhere in the galaxy goes about its business. SETI broadcasts signals into space, hoping that they will be picked up by extraterrestrial intelligence somewhere in our galaxy. What sort of signals does SETI broadcast? Not messages in English, Chinese, Hindi, Spanish, Arabic, or any other spoken language, but rather messages in math. Why? Because any species intelligent enough to “hear” these messages with technology would necessarily have to understand the mathematics to make such technology work. Mathematics isn’t just a global language, it is a galactic one (presuming life exists elsewhere).Like any science, our understanding of mathematics is growing and evolving. We do not know everything, and some of the concepts we believe we understand well could change in the future. However, even more so than other sciences, math is universal and absolute; it underpins the study of every other branch of science. Its laws govern chemistry, biology, physics, and more, and its certainties are more ironclad than those of any other field of study.The idea that mathematics is a white, imperialist construct and that the only reason we believe 2+2=4 is because we are steeped in the legacy of colonialism is patently ludicrous, dismissive of all the historical and current nonwhite mathematicians who have made invaluable contributions to the science, and indicative of how embarrassingly low the bar for public discourse has been set.Only in a world that is truly “post truth” could the assertion that 2+2≠4 be considered even semi-seriously. If you believe that Donald Trump is irresponsible and ignorant for saying — among other things — that COVID-19 would simply disappear when the weather warmed up (and this was indeed irresponsible and ignorant), then denying 2+2=4 is even worse. At least COVID is a virus about which we know relatively little and that could mutate. It was fantastical to imagine that summer heat would kill COVID, but it is verifiably ignorant and incorrect to imagine that 2+2≠4. Condemning Trump while embracing this mathematical fallacy is blind hypocrisy.Imagining 2+2≠4 as some form of outside the box, change-the-paradigm type thinking represents a disconnect from reality. After all, to change the paradigm we must understand it, and 2+2≠4 is an extreme misunderstanding. The laws of math are pure. They are uninterested in our political goals — no matter how noble — and our historical grievances — no matter how legitimate. They are not beholden to ideology, and there is no way to overturn the imperialist roots they do not have. When ostracizing the universal language becomes a goal of those seeking justice, it is easy to imagine equity becoming not closer but more elusive.The InnovationA place for variety of stories from different backgroundsFollow68 1 Sign up for The Innovation DigestBy The InnovationOfficial newsletter of The Innovation Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

The Ancient Significance of Numbers,https://medium.com/illumination/the-ancient-significance-of-numbers-34b8ed544d40?source=tag_archive---------4-----------------------,"Writing,Philosophy,Mathematics,History,Religion","Photo by Eduardo Romero on UnsplashMany strange legends surround the life of Pythagoras, a Greek thinker born around 600 B.C.E, and the secrets he kept. The Oracle of Delphi foretold his birth and life, predicting to his parents that they would raise a man unsurpassed in beauty and wisdom. It was widely circulated at the time that he was born by immaculate conception, his mother impregnated by the god Apollo. He lived one hundred years and started an esoteric secret school in Italy where he taught, by divine inspiration, the subjects of mathematics and geometry, music and astronomy. He invented the term philosopher, a modest term for a thinker, while his intellectual contemporaries all called themselves ‘sages.’Very little of his actual teachings survive to this day, seeing how his students took vows of silence and secrecy. The Pythagorean Theorem, the most famous and only mathematical idea to escape his school, is taught in every high school geometry class. Those initiated into his secret cabal 2500 years ago saw him as half man, half god and revered him as such. Aristotle, and some of Pythagoras’s other contemporaries, recorded a few of the ideas from his secret school in their own works. Among the most interesting philosophical ideas that Pythagoras taught was the theory of numbers. Each number, one through ten, had important and significant meaning to this secretive way of thinking.OneThe Throne of Jupiter, One is the mind. 1 is the essence of all thought. One is singular and the most powerful number, as such associated with the Sun as well, because this number is the center of the universe. Other names for this number are ‘ship’ and ‘chariot’ and, around it, revolve love, piety and truth. It has no beginning and no end, is entirely good, and in the sense of time it is NOW, because eternity knows neither past nor future, knows neither beginning nor end.TwoIf 1 is the Father, 2 is the Mother. This number expresses duality and the simultaneous polarity of all things. It represents harmony, tolerance and marriage, but also evil, darkness and inequality. Two was commonly associated with Isis (or Mother Nature). While the number signifies ignorance, because it is the first number to depart from the deific One, it is the mother of wisdom, because wisdom can only grow out of ignorance.ThreeThis number signifies the union between 1 and 2, the Child of the Father and the Mother, the number of knowledge, and represents Saturn, the god who ruled over time itself. The triangle, a sacred geometric shape, is made up of three corners and three sides. The three wisdoms are associated with this number: geometry, astronomy and music. Also, wisdom is to see the three sides of time: past, present and future.Four4 is the most perfect number. The soul of man consists of four properties: mind, science, opinion and sense. All fours are intellectual. It connects all beings, elements, numbers and seasons. The world, signified by 36, is made up of the addition of the first four even numbers and the first four odd numbers. The first four integers, 1, 2, 3, 4, added together equal 10, which is the greatest of all numbers, signifying the universe. Four is the makeup of the universe.FiveThis number is equilibrium, because it divides into 10, the universe, two equal parts. Five is the symbol for light and vitality and also represents the fifth element, ether, apart from the other four elements of air, water, earth and fire. By signifying the fifth element, this number is the superiority of the spiritual nature over the material nature. Five also represents all superior and inferior beings, is the number of Venus and immortality.SixSacred to Orpheus, 6 represents the creation of the universe and the birth of the soul. This number is also the symbol for marriage, because it is the union of two triangles, one masculine and one feminine. Fate is in the number 6, as is time, immortality and the totality of the world (3+2+1=6). This number also signifies harmony in music, which, to the Pythagoreans, was one of the ways to communicate with the gods.SevenThe 3 (spirit, mind and soul) descend into 4 (the world) and the sum is 7. Seven signifies religion. 7 is a sacred number to many ancient belief systems and is symbolized by the cube, which has six sides and a seventh mysterious point within. In the midst of six directions (north, south, east, west, up and down) and in the midst of six elemental properties (earth, fire, air, water, spirit and nature) stands One: Man. Geometrically speaking, the center point of a cube is Man, from whom radiates six pyramids.EightHalf of 8 is 4, half of 4 is 2 and half of 2 is 1, reestablishing the number 1 as the building block of the universe. Eight was called, by Pythagoreans, the little holy number. The number represents Neptune, as well as love, prudence and law.NineThe first square of an odd number (3 x 3 = 9). This number signifies failure and shortcoming, due to it falling short of 10 (the universe) by 1 (the deity), but also represents Mankind, partly because of a human being’s gestational period. 9 is boundless like the ocean and the horizon, limitless because there is nothing beyond it but 10. Nine is associated with the god Prometheus, who, in legend, steals fire from the gods to give to mankind for the good of civilization.Ten10 is the nature of all numbers, the most perfect and greatest of all numbers, according to Pythagoreans. It is both heaven and the world, the entire universe and all within. 10 is tireless and everything, and specifically refers to power, harmony and memory. It is associated with Atlas, who carried the world on his shoulders, and the Sun itself, the maker of light and life.Just as Pythagoras’s life and teachings was shrouded in mystery, so was the account of his death. A well known story about the death of Pythagoras is that he rejected a potential student from the school, who turned on him and led a violent mob against him, burning down his school with Pythagoras and his followers inside. Another story is that the mob attempted to burn down the school but Pythagoras’s followers sacrificed their lives in the fire for their teacher’s escape. Yet another story is the attempt on the life of Pythagoras at the school was unsuccessful, but he was found and burned alive inside an inn, resting for the night, after the escape. But the most tragic of all the tales about the end of Pythagoras’s life was this: He survived all the assassination attempts on his life, while his students did not, and a short time after his school was incinerated, Pythagoras died of a broken heart, despondent over the fact that his destiny to illuminate mankind would forever remain unrealized.ILLUMINATIONWe curate outstanding articles from diverse domains and…Follow124 WritingPhilosophyMathematicsHistoryReligion124 claps124 clapsWritten byJoshua Del ReyFollowJoshua Del Rey is a Chicago based organic life form.FollowILLUMINATIONFollowWe curate and disseminate outstanding articles from diverse domains and disciplines to create fusion and synergy.FollowWritten byJoshua Del ReyFollowJoshua Del Rey is a Chicago based organic life form.ILLUMINATIONFollowWe curate and disseminate outstanding articles from diverse domains and disciplines to create fusion and synergy.More From MediumTwelve Aquinas AphorismsEric Scheske in A Philosopher’s StoneJust How Meaningful Is Coincidence Beyond the Statistics?Aeon Magazine in Aeon MagazineHow Would We Live if We Were Going to Live Forever?Toby Tremlett in The Apeiron BlogDeath Gives Life More MeaningPhil Rosen in Live Your Life On PurposeStoic advice: should I vote for the lesser evil?Massimo Pigliucci in Stoicism — Philosophy as a Way of LifeThe Poetic Side Of ScienceLenka Otap in PredictDo  We Really Have No Free Will?Sam Vervaeck in Train of ThoughtThe Helper’s High: The Neurobiology of Helping OthersTannya D.

SafePredict — Asymptotic error bounds for online-learning,https://medium.com/@sj2538/safepredict-asymptotic-error-bounds-for-online-learning-c02da4e4b846?source=tag_archive---------5-----------------------,"Machine Learning,Algorithms,Error Handling,Statistics,Mathematics","OverviewIn this blog post, we introduce a meta-algorithm called SafePredict that provides asymptotic error bounds on any predictor in an online-learning framework, by refusing to make predictions in certain cases. Online learning in this context means that the algorithm learns as new data arrives. Refusing to make predictions means that even if the underlying machine learning algorithm(s) make predictions, SafePredict may refuse to output that prediction. The error bounds are only on those predictions that SafePredict outputs. The original paper describing this algorithm can be found here.We will consider the applications of such an algorithm, provide intuition about how it works, and walk through its open-source implementation that is based on scikit-learn and can be found on Github here.IntroductionModern machine learning methods have proven themselves to be adept at inferring statistical patterns from given data and making predictions when shown new data.However, a major challenge facing practical applications of these methods is that they may suffer from a high error rate. In any application where a machine learning model is expected to have a certain level of accuracy, meta-algorithms that refuse to accept the predictions made by the model are useful in ensuring that the error rate for the non-refused predictions has an upper bound. Such algorithms utilize information about the model, the data, or a combination of both to decide whether to output the model’s output to a user or to refuse to do so.The promise of this approach has motivated the development of several different meta-algorithms suited to a variety of applications. In this post, we will take a deeper look into SafePredict, one such meta-algorithm that has been developed for predictors in an online-learning framework.Online-learning is inherently suited to applications where data is naturally temporal (ex. financial time-series data) and where dynamic adaptability is required due to changing data distributions. The dynamic adaptability is particularly relevant when there is ‘concept drift’.Consider for example recommender systems. Recommending a movie that was very popular in 1994 may not make sense to a millennial in 2020. The concept of “enjoyable movie” has “drifted”. Similarly, you might not want to be trading financial instruments based on an algorithm using data from a day or a week ago; you might want to be capturing current trends as accurately as possible. Technically, we say that the data is not i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed).The intuitive reason SafePredict does not require i.i.d data is that it refuses to output predictions if a previously good model all of a sudden starts to have a high error rate. The approach taken by SafePredict is to utilise the previous performance of the underlying predictor to predict whether it will be wrong or not. It will decide to accept or refuse a prediction based on a certain probability, and then update that acceptance/refusal probability based on the error rate of the non-refused outcomes.SafePredictSafePredict uses an expert advice framework to decide when to trust the base predictor and when to refuse to accept its prediction. In SafePredict, we only have two “experts”, namely the base predictor (which itself could be an ensemble, but which SafePredict treats as a single predictor), and a ‘dummy’ predictor that always refuses to make a prediction. Thus there are only two possible outputs, a prediction, or an indication that no prediction was made.If the base predictor makes accurate predictions, we assign a higher probability to it than to the refusing predictor. Thus, SafePredict believes the base predictor as long as it continues to perform well. However, if the base predictor starts to become inaccurate, SafePredict gives the refusing predictor a higher probability of being selected. Later, if the base predictor enjoys greater accuracy, SafePredict will assign it a higher probability again.If “too inaccurate” or “believing” in a predictor seem like hand-wavy terms, we can look at the equation at the core of how SafePredict works:Here, w at time t+1 is the probability of the base predictor being selected for the next prediction based on the loss (l at time t) which is binary in our case (prediction was correct or not). If the loss is 1, i.e., the prediction was incorrect, the exponential term scales the probability of the base predictor down according to η, which is the learning rate. This parameter influences how sensitive SafePredict is to the performance of the base predictor. Intuitively, a smaller learning rate will cause SafePredict to adapt slower to any changes in the base predictor’s error rate, which might cause it to be wrong for extended periods of time. However, a high learning rate might cause it to behave erratically where each observation causes a drastic change in its parameters. Another way of thinking about it is that a smaller learning rate gives SafePredict a “longer memory” where its parameters are affected by a larger number of datapoints that it has seen previously. Similarly, a higher learning rate means it “forgets” all except the few data points it last saw as they have the largest impact on its parameters. 𝜖 is the target error rate that we want SafePredict to achieve as an asymptotic error bound, i.e., we do not want SafePredict to exceed that error rate.There are two important quality metrics relevant to any refusal method such as SafePredict. First, a pipeline including SafePredict is valid if the error rate of the predictions that SafePredict outputs is less than or equal to the user-set error bound. The second quality metric is efficiency, which is the fraction of outputs from the base model that SafePredict outputs (i.e., doesn’t refuse). With a high probability SafePredict refuses only a finite number of times if shown an infinite number of data points when the base predictor achieves the user-defined error bound. We will see in the next section how we can select parameters that optimize SafePredict for both validity, and efficiency.SafePredict and other Refusal MechanismsThere exist other confidence based methods of deciding whether to refuse a prediction. A simple example would be rejecting predictions whose inputs are situated too close to the separating hyperplane of a Support Vector Machine (SVM). Another approach proposed in this Google research paper is to check whether the data point is similar to other data points that are known to belong to the same class as the data point under consideration. The basic idea in such methods is to assign “confidence-scores” to each prediction, and refuse the prediction if the score is below a certain threshold. A simple way of obtaining such a score in practice is using the predict_proba() method available in most scikit-learn estimators. These methods work well when the data is i.i.d.SafePredict can take the outputs from these ‘i.i.d refusal meta-algorithms’ as input and decide whether to output the resulting prediction. When the data is not i.i.d (e.g., when there is concept drift), SafePredict will refuse to output some of its inputs. Using SafePredict in conjunction with such methods has improves the overall efficiency relative to SafePredict as the only meta-algorithm. The reason is that the confidence based methods have better efficiency since they depend on stronger assumptions about the data (that the data is i.i.d). However, the assumptions made by confidence based meta-algorithms fail to achieve validity if the data distribution changes. This is remedied by the use of SafePredict on top of these confidence based meta-algorithms.Using SafePredict for Binary ClassificationIn this demo, we will use online-learning to train a Random Forest model from scikit-learn on the popular cod-rna dataset. We will see how SafePredict can be used to bound the error rate of the predictions made by this model. Finally, we will introduce an artificial change in the data distribution in the middle of the dataset by randomly shuffling the class labels for half of the dataset to show that SafePredict is robust against such dramatic changes in the incoming data.The first step is to install the SafePredict library, scikit-learn, and other supporting libraries.pip install threadpoolctl joblib numpy scikit-learnpip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ SafePredictWe then import the safePredict method from the SafePredict library, the Random Forest model from scikit-learn, and other supporting methods:We use the fetch_openml method provided by scikit-learn to get the cod-rna dataset and store it in two arrays ‘X’, and ‘y’ which hold the feature values and class labels respectively.Any other dataset can be passed to ‘X’ and ‘y’ here (for ex. by reading data from a .csv file), and a list of the datasets available directly from the fetch_openml function can be found here: https://www.openml.org/search?type=dataWe now arbitrarily modify the default class labels for the cod-rna dataset from ‘-1’ and ‘1’ to ‘0’ and ‘1’ respectively to show that feature engineering is compatible with SafePredict.We use only 15000 points from the dataset to make the processing faster.This part is where you can do exploratory data analysis and feature engineering.Now we use scikit-learn methods to split our dataset into distinct datasets that we will use for training, and testing our models. Specifically, we will use ‘X’ and ‘y’ for training, and ‘holdout_X’ and ‘holdout_y’ for testing. Note that in online-learning, the difference between the training and test dataset is that we do not change the parameters of SafePredict or the base predictor while testing. However, since we want to test how SafePredict responds to changes in the underlying distribution, we need to observe the error rates of SafePredict and the base predictor while they are adapting to the incoming data while training. Thus, for the purposes of this tutorial, we will only use ‘X’ and ‘y’.Now, we introduce artificial change points in the incoming data distribution which are points when the distribution changes.In order to do so, we simply shuffle the class labels at every change point to make it appear as if the data is drawn from a different distribution.numCP is the number of change points we want to introduce and that number can be any integer from 0 to T, with T being the size of the dataset.We will now initialize SafePredict with the following parameters:target_error: This is the error rate that we want SafePredict to use as an upper bound. We set it arbitrarily to 0.05alpha: The minimum possible probability that SafePredict will accept a prediction. Using 0.1/T guarantees that SafePredict will respect the upper bound.horizon: The total number of data points SafePredict expects to see. Here, it is the size of the data set.Info about all the parameters for SafePredict can be found in the README on GitHub: https://github.com/ShanJ35/SafePredictEpsilon is our target error rate, and here we set it to 0.05, i.e., we want our error rate to be bounded at 5% of the total number of data points SafePredict sees.SafePredict uses a Random Forest classifier as the default base predictor if not provided one by the user. We will compare the performance of SafePredict using a Random Forest to another Random Forest model by itself.In order to simulate online-learning, we will pass one data point at a time to SafePredict, and retrain the base predictor every 100 datapoints. Also, we will ask SafePredict to decide whether to refuse a prediction before it sees the next data point, as is the case in online-learning.We will now calculate the error rate for SafePredict, i.e., of the total number of data points for which SafePredict accepted the prediction, which fraction were predicted incorrectly.We will now repeat the experiment for Random Forest without SafePredict in a similar online-learning setting and calculate its error rate.We will now plot the error rates to show that the use of SafePredict bounds the error rate to the provided threshold. Especially after around 5000 samples, when the change point is introduced, we show that Random Forest by itself greatly increases in its error rate whereas SafePredict respects the error rate threshold.The results from this experiment are shown below:As can be seen in the results, the base predictor sees a large increase in the error rate after the change point. However, the predictions that SafePredict accepts achieve the target error rate.The above tutorial can be found as a Jupyter Notebook here.This tutorial is based on my work with Prof. Dennis Shasha (NYU Courant) and Dr. Anil Kocak (MIT Broad Institute) where we are packaging SafePredict to be compatible with popular machine learning libraries like scikit-learn and PyTorch.

"<strong class=""bt"">5 Things Discovered/Invented By Indians Before The West</strong>",https://medium.com/@snehabhat.bhat4/5-things-discovered-invented-by-indians-before-the-west-c71004d8bf1d?source=tag_archive---------7-----------------------,"History,Mathematics,Science,India,General","An Insight Into The Contributions Of Ancient India To The WorldTHE FIBONACCI SERIES:We’re all pretty familiar with this series. Some might have encountered it during a coding challenge, some might have learnt in their elementary school. But contrary to the popular notion, this was not invented by Fibonacci. It was invented , or rather discovered in India in 3rd century CE, by Pingala. In Fact Fibonacci only translated the series from the ‘Sutras Of Pingala’.2. GRAVITY :The concept of gravity was already known to Indian Mathematicians like Brahmagupta, Aryabhatta and Varahamithra, who lived thousands of years before Sir Isaac Newton was even born. What Newton invented was the universal law of gravity , which also gave us the mathematical equation for gravitational force.Universal Law of GravityBrahmagupta-II , who lived in the 7th century C.E stated:“All heavy things fall down to earth by a law of nature. It is the nature of the earth to attract things. Thrown object always returns. Earth on all its sides is same”3. THE NUMBER SYSTEM:We owe a lot to the Indians, who taught us how to count, without which no worthwhile scientific discovery could have been made.”- Albert EinsteinThe invention of 0 (zero) is credited to the Indian Mathematician Aryabhatta. But in reality, the entire number system was an invention of the Hindus. The Arabs learnt it from the Indians, and when the West learnt it from the Arabs, they called it the Arabic Numerals. In fact the Persians who learnt it from the Indian Mathematicians used to call it the Hindu Numerals. The decimal system was invented in India between 1st and 6th centuries CE.4. UNIVERSITY:Nalanda UniversityThe first university of the world, the Nalanda University, was established in India during the Gupta Empire in 5th century C.E. The university had separate living quarters both for teachers and students. Students from all over the world would come here to study Vedas, Sanskrit, Mathematics, etc. . the Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang stayed at Nalanda in the 7th century BCE for some time ,left a clear account of the subjects studied there and of the general features of the community. Nalanda was sacked during Muslim raids in Bihar (c. 1200) and never recovered. Around 1193 CE, Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji, a Turkic chieftain, ransacked the university and burnt thousands of valuable scriptures in the university library.5. PLASTIC SURGERY:Maharishi SushruthaThe art of plastic surgery was extensively practiced in India, as early as 6th century B.C. Sushrutha, the father of surgery (in India), is credited for its invention. His works are compiled in a book called Sushrutaa Samhita. For successful surgery, Sushruta induced anesthesia using intoxicants such as wine and henbane (Cannabis indica). He treated numerous cases of rhinoplasty, lobuloplasty, and otoplasty. Even today, rhinoplasty described by Sushrutha, is referred to as the Indian flap“A person who possesses courage and presence of mind, a hand free from perspiration, tremor less grip of sharp and good instruments and who carries his operations to the success and advantage of his patient who has entrusted his life to the surgeon. The surgeon should respect this absolute surrender and treat his patient as his own son.”Sushrutha (6th century B.C.E)Written bySneha BhatAnime Geek, Animal Lover, Cat Owner , Engineer , Data Science enthusiastFollowHistoryMathematicsScienceIndiaGeneralMore from Sneha BhatFollowAnime Geek, Animal Lover, Cat Owner , Engineer , Data Science enthusiastMore From MediumA Matter of Life and DeathBebe Nicholson in ILLUMINATION-CuratedHow Many of Da Vinci’s Inventions Actually Worked?Danny Kane in Age of AwarenessWhat we can Learn from Dead Democracies — Market Mad HouseDaniel G.

GEOMETRY ON SURFACES,https://medium.com/@nabil.madali/geometry-on-surfaces-4c7302e2fe1d?source=tag_archive---------8-----------------------,"Geometry,Computer Graphics,Computer Vision,Mathematics","A curve is a one-dimensional manifold that can be differentiated in a two-dimensional space. The curve can be expressed as the following form with a parametric equation:Where, x and y are differentiable functions of u respectively, then the tangent vector of the curve at a certain point is a vector composed of the first derivative of each component:if p′(u) is not 0 at u this point becomes the curve regular points .The normal vector of the curve at a certain point is defined as follows :The same curve can be expressed by using different parameters through parameter transformation. The differential geometry of a curve focuses on properties such as arc length and curvature that are independent of specific parameters, which means that no matter how the parameters are transformed, the values of these properties are the same.Arc lengthThe arc length from the starting point a to any point u on the curve can be expressed as:The arc length is the integral of the tangent vector length to the curve parameters. The arc length is an intrinsic property of the curve does not depend on choice of parameterization.A curve is parameterized by arc length ifFor such curves we haveAnd the tangent vectorHas a norm equal to one and is thus a unit tangent vector.We will consider only curves parameterized by arc length.CurvatureCurve curvature is the rate of angular rotation with respect to the tangential direction of the arc length of a point on the curve.If the curve is twice differentiable, that is, if the second derivatives of x and y exist, then the derivative of T(s) exists. This vector is normal to the curve, its norm is the curvature κ(s), and it is oriented toward the center of curvature :Moreover, as the radius of curvature isThe curvature indicates how much the normal changes, in the direction tangent to the curveThe Osculating PlaneThe plane determined by the unit tangent and normal vectors T(s) and N(s) is called the osculating plane at s .The Binormal VectorFor points s, s.t. κ(s) ≠ 0, the binormal vector B(s) is defined as:The binormal vector defines the osculating planeThe Frenet FrameThe set {T(s), N(s), B(s)} form an orthonormal basis for R³ called the Frenet frame,and Frenet–Serret formulas are:Where , τ (z) is the Torsion that indicates how much the normal changes, in the direction orthogonal to the osculating plane of the curve.The curvature is always positive, the torsion can be negative and both properties do not depend on the choice of parameterization.Continuous surfaceSuppose the parametric equation of a three-dimensional surface is as follows:Where, x, y, and z are differentiable functions of the parameters u and v.Similar to a curve, the tangent plane at point (u,v) of a surface is determined by its first derivative :These two partial derivatives represent the tangent vectors on the following two curvesWe can express the normal vector representing a certain point on the plane asWe define the unit-length direction t in the tangent plane as :Then the intersection of the surface with the plane through n and t is denoted γ curveThe Normal curvature is defined as:We can define the following :Minimal curvature :Maximal curvature :Mean curvature :Gaussian curvature :A point p on the surface is called :Elliptic, if K > 0Parabolic, if K = 0Hyperbolic, if K < 0ReferenceCoolidge, J.

Friction,https://medium.com/physics-daily/friction-e68142132224?source=tag_archive---------11-----------------------,"Physics,Mathematics,Wonder,Beauty,Perfect","Friction is by far the most misunderstood force of all times. Most of us think that friction is responsible only for slowing things down. Well it’s true, but it does more than that. It is also responsible for making things move .Many a times this the case. When we ride a bicycle what pushes us forward, well we think that we pedal so we move ahead, that’s true for the back tire, but what about the front tire. Who pushes that forward? Why are some surfaces slippery and others rough? We will try and answer such questions here.Surprisingly, friction is the force behind the movement of all vehicles. See, the engines are mostly responsible for forcing the rear tires to move, but it is actually friction which is responsible for the movement of the front wheels. If there would have been no friction the front wheels wouldn’t rotate and just skid on the road. This is because, according to newton’s first law, a stationary object does not move without a force, and because there is force on the front wheel it would just not move. There are two types of friction forces- Kinetic friction and Static friction. Static friction tries to prevent the movement of a stationary object which is being forced to move. And Kinetic friction slows an already moving object. But now, another question arises- Who provides this frictional force? It is the ground which provides friction. Actually all surfaces are capable to provide some amount of friction, from concrete roads to our skin and even air, all provide friction [Friction due to air and water, fluids in general, is called viscosity]. Now, we know that some objects are slippery while others are rough. This variation also happens due to friction. Actually, this happens due to the varied amounts of friction. Frictional force [f] is equal to: f=uN. This “u” [actually Greek letter mu] is called the coefficient of friction, it varies for according to kinetic or static and from surface to surface. The coefficient of friction, decides the amount of friction and it differs from surface to surface. So the more the friction coefficient, rougher the surface and less friction coefficient results on a slippery surface.Well that marks an end to our very brief discussion on friction. But there is something this blog tells, but does not answer. After reading this blog, if you find something that is introduced here but does not answer, please write it in the comments and I will make another blog to answer that.

But what happens to a gallon when you are using a bottle? How do you convert ounces to gallons? First, let’s figure out how many ounces are in a gallon:128 fluid ounces = 1 American gallon160 ounces (UK) = 1 UK gallonIf you’re not excited about the idea of ​​lagging around a one-gallon plastic container of water, then you may be wondering how many glasses of water you need to drink to get into one-gallon. A separate glass of water is eight ounces. If you use the same size glass, you will need to drink 16 glasses of water (8 ounces each) to reach one gallon each day.Written byRahuljjiFollowMathematicsNewsMoviesLatestWaterMore from RahuljjiFollowMore From MediumClimate change: Increasing the frequency and intensity of floodingWilliam House in EarthSphereMy Personal Battle Against PlasticRosie KhdirSustainability Should Be in Every Company’s Mission StatementSean Youra in The StartupProtecting milkweed to preserve monarchsLos Alamos National LabPesticides Are Making Bees DumberPopular Science in Popular ScienceNuclear and the climate: the good, the bad and the long-term.Desirée A.

Learn Linear Algebra for Machine Learning from the best,https://towardsdatascience.com/learn-linear-algebra-for-machine-learning-from-the-best-ae95ab92c6f9?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Machine Learning,Data Science,Python,Mathematics,Math","Image by PEXELSIntroductionAbout 4 or 5 years ago, I am sitting in a math class and the teacher is introducing the topic of vectors for the first time.“Vector is a line segment which has both a direction and a magnitude.”This was when I thought that I was done with mathematics for good. In school, whenever a teacher introduced some big topic in maths, they always said that the concept is very important in real life and I should learn it. I never asked why and just went with it. The reason was that I actually really liked mathematics and was good with numbers. I even participated in a bunch of maths competitions and won a few.But when it came to vectors, I simply could not understand how lines with pointy tips could have applications in real life (I won’t blame anyone for not explaining). At that time, it seemed very absurd to learn such a thing and I lost my interest in math.Up until this year, I never saw any real-life applications of my mathematics knowledge. However, things changed when I decided to learn Computer Science and found out that mathematics is the bedrock of my field of interest -Machine Learning.When should you learn Linear Algebra for Machine Learning?Machine learning consists of several algorithms suited for different real-life problems. Anyone with a solid programming foundation can become a good machine learning engineer using ready-made tools, libraries, and models. But if you want to become a real specialist in the field, you cannot escape learning some of the concepts of Linear Algebra.All the magic that happens under the hood of any machine learning algorithm, especially Deep Learning, is mostly Linear Algebra math. So, before I started learning ML, many were dead set that Linear Algebra is a big prerequisite. Not just Linear Algebra, I also came across many posts saying that multivariate calculus and PCA were also very important and should not be ignored. I wanted to be a ‘professional’ so, I took the recommendations to heart and found a course on Coursera which teaches all the above. And…. big mistake!See, all the things that I read said math was important but they never said when. Turns out there is so much to ML before you get to fancy algorithms and working on real problems. Thankfully, I found out about this truth right after I finished learning some Linear Algebra and about to move to multivariate calculus.So, my advice is this: just get into learning Machine Learning or Data Science without math at first. Whenever you start learning algorithms, learn each one to the full extent. If you do not understand the math behind, then start taking math courses that fill your knowledge gap. This is how you make progress, learning by doing. Don’t make the mistake of learning something before you even know what it is for. Otherwise, you are going to burn out several times and forget the majority of your knowledge before you start applying them.Now, as promised, let’s move on to the actual resources to learn Linear Algebra.3Blue1Brown, Linear Algebra PlaylistThe first in our list is a YouTube legend Grant Sanderson, creator of the YouTube channel 3Blue1Brown. He uses a package he wrote in Python to visualize concepts of math with such beauty that you will fall in love with his videos.His Linear Algebra playlist contains only 15 chapters of Linear Algebra and yet, received almost 20 million views on YouTube. All his videos are aimed at giving the full intuition behind each math concept and do not bore you much with complex computational details.His explanations using 2D and 3D animations are of supreme quality and memorable. This is particularly useful for the Linear Algebra case because you will be dealing with a lot of vectors and linear transformations which are all topics that cannot be and should not be taught with pen and paper. To master Linear Algebra, you need the geometrical intuition of each topic and then, its algebraic representation.All in all, Grant Sanders gives the math world the visual component that it needs and besides, I love the soundtrack of his videos and the pi students. 😃Trefor Bazett, Linear Algebra Full CourseNext up in our list is the Linear Algebra full YouTube course by Trefor Bazett. He is a mathematics professor at the University of Cincinnati. His YouTube course on Linear Algebra is a perfect combination of visual explanations and teaching through well-defined examples.He first teaches each topic with visual animations and shows general formulas and computation methods. Then, the knowledge is further strengthened by solving problems without the complexity of letters and symbols but with actual matrices and vectors. You might be surprised how many instructors don’t go beyond just the messy formulas which we all hate.Khan Academy, Linear Algebra playlistLast but not least, we have another famous educator and online tutor, Sal Khan — creator of Khan Academy. His Linear Algebra playlist on YouTube or on his website can be considered as a deep dive into Linear Algebra.There are more than 140 videos with almost all of them lasting at least 15 minutes. He does a great job of explaining each topic in theory and through examples. He also provides proof for many of the topics in Linear Algebra. I don’t recommend watching all of his videos because not all of them are related to Machine Learning in general.But if you want a systematic learning approach to Linear Algebra and mastering its fundamental topics to the fullest, it is a great place to learn.Which one should I choose?My advice is don’t choose one but use all of the three in combination. Any single one of them does not cover all the topics you need. What I did was I would watch one chapter from 3B1B and watch the corresponding topic videos from the other two.

The End of Innovation: The Problem and a sneak peak at How To Fix It,https://medium.com/@joshreece/the-end-of-innovation-the-problem-and-a-sneak-peak-at-how-to-fix-it-bfd0b42ce202?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Politics,Philosophy,Mathematics,Machine Learning Ai,Game B","I would like to give credit to a few people first, the ideas in the essay I refined through conversation with many of my fellow collegians; A special thanks to Josh Salthouse, Will Power, Harry Isles, Charlie Strong, Campbell Rickard, Anthony James and Chris Chamberlain. And of course a thanks to all those others who have been there for me during my ups and downs haha.There I was languishing in obscurity and boredom amongst 200 of my senior year compatriots, still barely filling a seventh of the theatre. Costa Hall to be exact, the same hall I would later receive my mathematics award in.The Inner Bowels of Costa HallImpressive only in scale the theatre is extraordinarily bland, in a remarkably dystopian display, the walls, the carpet and every seat are identically coloured a kind of muddy purple brown. The lighting is entirely artificial, one is repelled by the totalising order of the place. It is the kind of thing you might imagine seeing in the nice parts of Moscow or St Petersburg in the USSR if it still existed and was in the business of building 5th rate modern Universities.There we were being lectured from a man atop the stage with the largest PowerPoint presentation I have seen in my life. He condescended at first to excite and cajole the vain ambition of the cohort but then in a somewhat bizarre fashion — as though breaking the fourth wall on the scam being perpetrated — he started to describe how education was being acquired by everyone, that over half our generation were going to acquire a Bachelor’s Degree and how it was necessary for us to obtain a degree even if we just wanted to have 2 children and a house with a white picket fence.It was just a short glimpse then the narrative quickly returned, rushing in to suppress any doubt. It was in fact he told us that society was so much more complicated now, that is why we needed a degree. An investigation of the facts belies his propaganda.[1]: ABS Higher Education StatsThe data above from the ABS presents a confusing and dire image. The problem is staring us right in the face, we have an explosion of students graduating with degrees in Society and Culture, followed up by those studying Management and Commerce degrees. Meanwhile Engineering degrees fall just short of population growth (=> proportional decrease).A look at the high-growth subcategories raises the question “Accountants?!”, what are they accounting? Software applications have dramatically reduced the need for human labour in that sector and that trend will only continue with ML solutions. Without even yet mentioning the fact that a University degree is overkill for accounting in the first place. It is more than possible with the resources available online today to teach oneself accounting for free.We appear to live in a strange dystopia that is far from a dynamic free market society since after all industry has not caught on. HR drones from Pitcher Partners and EY did us the favour of coming to College to waste our time by telling us how they would like us to behave blah.. blah… to have the privilege of working for them at a lower rate than you would get paid as a high school mathematics teacher. They told us they did not care about WAMs so long as they were above 60 and that online degrees were fine, all they cared about was the degree. I asked “would you consider someone without a degree if they were able to demonstrate superior knowledge of the subject matter?”, “No” was of course the reply with the unsatisfying response that it was due to discipline or something (seeing as they said online was fine they had conceded it had nothing to do with social or soft skills), of course the discipline argument makes no sense considering there is nothing more self-disciplined than teaching yourself the content of an entire University degree although that sounds like more of a feat than it actually is especially for arts and commerce (I have taken some subjects).It is remarkable how everyone in the key institutions of governance and the private sector all appear to be on a script. Notably it is always the careerists not the entrepreneurs (the real ones), that are on the script — these careerists need a better name I shall call them the nouveau científicos.The nouveau científicos are different from previous technocrats because they emphasise the role of uncertainty and the fallibility of the human mind. They do not believe we can possibly know what the future will hold but they are sure it is good.Given the dysfunction presented here with regards to the academy (and there are many more statistics and figures one could present until the reader collapses from exhaustion) my reaction to the oft heard phrase “dizzying pace of change” should be obvious, we are in fact experiencing a tremendous rapid slowdown in progress.It becomes much clearer when we just take a look at the technologies. Let us compare the two halves of the last century 1920–1970 vs 1970–2020.From 1920–1970,By all accounts one would not imagine this period to be one of immense progress given that it transpired just after the West had been ravaged by the First World War and the world by the Spanish Influenza and the bookend on the other side was the middle of the Vietnam War. In between is sandwiched The Great Depression and World War 2. Countries leveraged themselves up to the hilt financially as the modern nation state reached the climax of mechanised destruction and yet they miraculously recovered.This was possible because of the widespread adoption of an endless stream of life changing technologies. Where do we start? Vacuum cleaners, the motor vehicle, radio, television, refrigerators, air conditioning, the movies, antibiotics, vaccines, nuclear power, microwaves, plastics, computers, washing machines, air travel, etc. Not to mention the successful large scale public sector projects that are unimaginable today — countries building interstate highway systems, the Manhattan project, putting mankind on the moon, Arpanet.This is why the greatest generation earned their name, they were the greatest generation and we generation Z’ers should look back to them — past the boomers and the silents if we want to put the world back on track.From 1970–2020The 70s in contrast to the 20s had almost every reason to succeed. Wars were trivial by comparison, little in the way of infectious diseases, after the Vietnam war a relatively content population, low wealth and income inequality and plenty of opportunity.From the 70s onward you have very slow technological progress. Biochemistry does not live up to its expectations, all the fields of engineering begin slowing down and none of the aforementioned technologies are displaced they are only incrementally improved. The one glaring exception to the rule is information technology where almost science fiction progress has prevailed.Personal computation, laptops, tablets, phones, video games, machine learning, the internet and cloud computing. (What about the human genome project? It has not translated to real gains yet.) Progress has become so isolated to information technology that it has become synonymous with technology itself.There is a sense in which information technology is a kind of super technology, its ability to work with large amounts of data and carry out what for humans would be impossibly precise numerical calculations nearly instantaneously means it has the ability to have a kind of multiplicative as opposed to merely additive affect on progress. To make this more concrete what I am saying is information technology is a tool that allows you to make better tools as opposed to a washing machine which will improve your life and productivity dramatically but will not help you build better washing machines or other types of technology.Blue Curve is Exponential: f(x) = exp(30x), The Red Curve is the S Curve in this case a Sigmoid: f(x) = 1/(1+exp(-30x))I cannot comment too heavily on the history but we can use the forge as an analogy, forges let you build better tools that in turn allow you to extract and refine higher quality ore leading again to better tools in a feedback loop, along the way the better tools also enable you to build more additive technologies such as larger more robust buildings. These kinds of super technologies will provide exponential growth for a time but they will reach saturation at a point, (so that they actually look more like an S curve, Sigmoid functions like the one shown at left are used to model other effects like population growth which naturally must saturate after a certain point) and there is evidence that this is already happening with information technology.People have a belief that information technology is the exception and unlike the forge we will not be required to fundamentally shift our mode of production to realise exponential growth once more. This belief in part seems to be based on the idea that genius engineers will sometime soon invent a form of intelligence greater than their own — a Strong AI. In futurism circles this is known as the singularity.Graph of f(x) = 1/xIn mathematics a singularity is a point at which a function is not well defined. It may converge to different values along different paths or go to infinity, etc (or as in the example at left do both, converge to positive and negative infinity at x=0).If Strong AI were to be invented something like this would occur and we would not be able to say anything definite about what happened next but most hypotheses are either utopian or dystopian — most are dystopian. (For futurists they always seem to be utopian).If you have done a bit of research on how modern deep neural networks are constructed you will be confident that such an eventuality will not be coming without another complete revolution in our approach to the technology. (For just one example I would point to ObjectNet which has managed to fool almost all the previous models that beat human performance on ImageNet).This is not to say that there are not remarkable advances— there are— they are just not of the singularity type. ML is doing certain tasks far better than humans but is going to need humans to help it do these things, it is not just going to do them on its own.On what people would consider the more realistic front Andrew McAfee and Eric Brynjolfsson are also wrong, they are too optimistic, machine learning has serious limitations. Some of the best engineers in the world have been working on the problem of creating autonomous vehicles using neural nets for nearly a decade. Tesla is years ahead of all the others and still seems fairly far away from level 5 autonomy (much better than human). McAfee is a bit cringe at a few points, in the book he sounds like one of those hydrogen car people. He talks about cyclopean LiDAR as the most important sensor, as Elon has said LiDAR is just a crutch and he is right, maverick iPhone jailbreaker and founder of comma.ai George Hotz agrees. If you think you need LiDAR for autonomous vehicles you must be an alien because humans drive without lasers all the time. LiDAR is less important than cameras and probably less important than radar. [2]McAfee and Brynjolfsson writing a little bit earlier in the development of social media were much more optimistic in that area too. In their analyses they use the time people spend on social media platforms to predict the economic value provided to users by said platforms, with the rationale that because the platforms are free it is very difficult to properly assess just how much our lives have been improved by social media in a dollar value. Of course these days it is common knowledge that such websites are attempting feverishly to maintain time on site. Time on site allows the social media giants to show its users advertisements and gain data on their behaviour, they do not care about providing a great service so much as getting you addicted. My argument is that we ought to be analysing who is getting the better deal here — we the people — or the social media platforms. [2]McAfee and Brynjolfsson are right a lot of the time though, for one innovation is almost everything. They are also right that innovations often come from those you least expect and that there are still plenty of accessible fruit, if we can revolutionise our thinking. Unfortunately they subscribe to recombining view of technology — that massive improvements are made not by brand new ideas but through shuffling old ones around, I will address this soon, it is wrong and right — a kind of half-truth because what actually happens is that there is a break-through and then a lot of recombination that follows but then you hit saturation (see the S-Curve again) and need a new breakthrough or shift in thinking to reveal the new opportunities. [2]Stephen Wolfram of Wolfram Alpha and Wolfram Mathematica fame describes his views on this subject, “I’ve been fortunate enough to live through some [paradigm shifts] myself, [I’m] even probably responsible for some. I think the main process that seems to happen is a methodological advance is made, that opens up some new area, there is a bunch of low hanging fruit to be picked in that area, lots of exciting stuff happens for 5 years, 10 years, maybe a little bit longer. That area of science gets big, it gets quite institutionalised, it slows down, there is 50 or 100 years of sort of stasis and then maybe there is some kind of methodological advance and it opens up again.” [3]People underestimated neural networks but that does not mean they are going to keep on going revolutionising everything. If you have tried training a net on your own computer you will understand the computational restraints involved. If the revolution is going to continue and computers are going to conquer tasks even more difficult than autonomous-driving we are going to need a massive breakthrough on the materials science front.The Moore’s Law SlowdownPeople understand exponentiality stfu.[7]: Ray Kurzweil (2005, updated for 2016). The singularity is near: When humans transcend biologyIt is now generally accepted that Moore’s law is over. This was inevitable given that the statement “thou shall not be exponential with respect to any physical dimension forever” is basically a law of physics — one it would be nice to overcome but a reality of our present situation nonetheless.Ironically the source for the graph at left is the futurist Ray Kurzweil’s book The Singularity is Near Clearly he missed the characteristic S shaped curve, growth is slowing.Intel delayed its 10nm architecture for years and it will likely delay its 7nm for longer. My personal knowledge of semiconductors is fairly weak but there are obvious physical constraints. The fundamental issue is you really cannot go beyond 7nm with silicon because your electrons will start tunneling into adjacent transistors. You may be able to switch from silicon to carbon but even still we are not going to see much beyond another 10 fold increase here and that is going to take a lot of time. [4] [5] [6]You can increase the number of transistors but my understanding is this causes other issues. Because of the time it takes for information to move around the chip (speed of electric transmission) you cannot simply scale up because this will force you to reduce the clock speed of the chip. Also trying to fit more transistors into a small area will generate heat and that will cause issues if you do not slow down the clock speed. [8]This is not to say progress has stopped it is just to say progress has slowed down a lot and there is not a lot of hope for making the leaps and bounds we made up until this point within the bounds of our current understanding of physics.Personal Computing:Somewhat controversially I would say on the personal computing front the only thing that has really improved the regular user’s experience from a hardware perspective in the last decade is the prevalence of SSDs which dramatically reduce boot times and increased ram which make laptop/tablets far more viable. Not really an awe inspiring technology improvement, (SSDs have improved read and write speeds dramatically but practically for personal computing after you go beyond a couple of gigabits/second, (few hundred megabytes per second), it does not make a noticeable difference). Of course the last decade coincides with far more bloated web-based javascript applications countering some of the benefits of increased ram.My goal here is not to convince you that information technology is not one of the most amazing if not the most amazing technology in human history — it is just to call into question the default assumption of unbridled optimism moving forward, progress won’t happen on its own, you! the reader! have to drive technological progress by inventing!What went wrong? Ideology and Determination Pt.1 The Silents and The BoomersThe Silent and Baby Boom Generations experienced a period of unrivaled innovation in their childhoods and early adulthood. The economy was booming, labour was a sellers market and companies could afford to pay. We have all heard stories of the kinds of miraculous things that happened during this period. My Grandfather who worked hard in school got a full scholarship and salary from BHP to attend University and work there just one day per week. When I was younger my father told me the story of him leaving school half way through year 11 and finding a job working for a mechanic almost instantly. This seems foreign today and for good reason.The BoomerSi Generations took progress for granted and thus became complacent. They did not know what was going to improve or how but they knew it would.They were as Peter Thiel puts it “indefinite optimists” and the consequence of indefinite optimism is the shift away from engineering to finance.“[The indefinite optimist] expects to profit from the future but sees no reason to design it concretely. Instead of working for years to build a new product indefinite optimists rearrange already invented ones. Bankers make money by rearranging the capital structures of already existing companies. Lawyers resolve disputes over old things or help other people structure their affairs. And private equity investors and management consultants don’t start new businesses they squeeze extra efficiency from old ones with incessant procedural optimisation. It’s no surprise these fields attract disproportionate numbers of high achieving Ivy League optionality chasers. What could be a more appropriate reward for two decades of resume building than a seemingly elite process oriented career that promises to keep options open…… the strange history of the baby boom produced a generation of indefinite optimists so used to effortless progress that they feel entitled to it. Whether you were born in 1945 or 1950 or 1955 things got better every year for the first 18 years of your life and it had nothing to do with you.” (Thiel, Zero to One, 2–06). [23][9]: ABS Statistics on Higher EducationI apologise for ABS’s wonky presentation in this table. As can be seen here the trend toward Society and Culture as well as Business and Administration degrees started much earlier. Whereas Engineering degrees halve from pre-1971 to 91. Even if we assume that the emerging field of computer science was stealing brains from Engineering and the Physical Sciences the total for those three still falls from 16.9% in pre-1971 to 12.4% by 1991.There is nothing wrong with rearranging structures to make them more efficient but efficiency caps out at 100%, if you want to see real improvement you have to grow the pie not the percentage of the pie you are utilizing.Which pie do you want? Because there is a trade-off, efficiency constrains and restricts and when you reach 90% plus efficiency and there is very little profit to gain from this method of incremental improvement you will have the big 4 accounting firms paying graduates pennies and trying to distract them from their terrible salary with discounted gym memberships and other gimmicks. As you approach 100% your system will also be highly prone to rent-seeking behaviour under claims of increasing efficiency. There are other more mathematical problems with efficiency we will come to later.After technological progress began to slow post 1970 income inequality was able to keep the highly successful boomers on an upward trajectory.Booms, Busts and BankersFrom the period 1920–1970 there were no real crashes outside of 1929 and The Great Depression. There were a couple of blips with Suez and the Kennedy assassination but these were geopolitical events and should be considered differently. The boom bust cycle has only really existed with the current magnitude since the 70s with the first bust being Black Monday, people would like to blame the crash on computers but if it was really just computers then the market would not have taken 2 whole years to recover, the crash revealed that something dysfunctional was going on. Though that being said Black Monday was nothing like the Dot-com Crash and the 2008 global financial crisis. One could have invested in an S&P 500 index when I was born and if they had used a buy and hold strategy would not have made any money until I was 12 years old. If they had instead been long volatility they would have had a great time during that period. There is almost no better time for me to be presenting this argument since Spitznagel’s Black Swan fund has just made a 4000% return thanks to coronavirus. [10] Renaissance Technologies’ Medallion fund performed well during the Dot-Com crash, The GFC and earlier this year during the Rona plunge. [11] Renaissance being famous of course for only hiring mathematicians, physicists and engineers. It is worth asking oneself what has so radically changed since 2012 that justifies the current position of the market, especially considering the situation with the virus.The Dot-Com crash and the GFC were entirely the making of the financial sector. They are the product of the nouveau científicos (the indefinite optimists). There is a kind of disease in finance that can allow oneself to be deluded into believing in fundamental analysis. If a company has had consistent returns for a long time that can give you very little information depending on the nature of the distribution and the nature of the distribution may not easily be determined from a small number of observations.Brief Aside on Stats (may want to skip if math makes you feel stupid):comparing convergence to mean as n increases for Power Law vs High Variance Gaussian, Source: Statistical Consequences of Fat Tails, N.N. Taleb, pp.26, Figure 3.5 [12]comparing convergence to mean as n increases for Fat tail LLN vs Gaussian LLN, Source: Statistical Consequences of Fat Tails, N.N. Taleb, pp.27, Figure 3.6 [13]The law of large numbers is a statement about the lim as N -> infinity not about large N (though as a physics student and a fan of Richard Feynman I appreciate the attempt to give it a concrete name). For distributions that have a large kurtosis such as power laws standard methods used on normal distributions are not helpful. Height is an example of an approximately normal distribution. No matter how many people we search for we are probably never going to find someone who is 4m tall — the probability is so close to zero. Therefore if we have a sample of 999 people the 1000th person is unlikely to shift the sample mean much at all. Wealth is an example of a power law [21], if you have 999 people the 1000th person may have a massive impact on the sample mean, if the 1000th person is Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos then the value of the sample mean will increase by many orders of magnitude. In power laws rare events have much more weighting (x * p(x) is much larger because x is much larger). The famous Pareto 80–20 rule is an example of a power-law. Many probabilistic functions in finance have a kurtosis larger than a normal distribution. I was lucky to recently come across a thinker that elucidates these issues clearly his name is Nassim Nicholas Taleb and we will return to him later.This means an education in finance or economics may actually have adverse affects on someone’s ability to think, reinforcing the idea that the man we discussed at the beginning of the essay, the one telling us that the we needed a degree to understand this more “complicated world”, was a charlatan.Even after the GFC people still have not learned. There was a group of people called XIV traders so called because they were shorting the VIX (A Volatility Index) this went great for a few years because there was relatively little volatility but that is the point — you cannot predict volatility, when the VIX spiked in 2018 they all lost their money, the market does not suffer fools gladly. [14]P.S. I do not believe I am at all committing the middleman minority fallacy, the financial sector is rent-seeking and deserving of our ire.Decentralised Education: Copy what works — The Info Tech SectorDropoutsThe tech sector — by far the most innovative — is known for not really caring about formal education. In fact Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison, Michael Dell, Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg all dropped out of University. Peter Thiel (Paypal Mafia Member and Co-Founder of Palantir) has actively tried to undermine the University Degree system by creating the Thiel Fellowship. Reid Hoffman (PayPal Mafia Member and Founder of LinkedIn) has advocated for a total upending of the College Degree. Elon Musk (Paypal Mafia, Founder Tesla & SpaceX, OpenAI, Neuralink) says he does not care about College degrees only ability.All the big tech companies are happy to hire those without formal education. They just give them interview problems to see how mathematically capable they are. One amazon interview question is to find the function representing a hanging electricity cable, answering the question in a satisfying way will require you to have some sound intuition and will push the boundaries of first year calculus knowledge (second order single-variable differential equation to solve). Some like the 12 men on a seesaw problem are more of the brain teaser type.As mentioned previously the most successful hedge funds often look for applicants with no prior knowledge of finance. That is they take an approach similar to the tech companies. Quantitative Trading firms often ask their applicants the kind of brain teaser questions the tech companies often do.Incentives and CompetitionsThe tech sector does more than just hire people though it actively encourages innovation and autodidacts through competitions called hackathons. Tech companies big an small hold hackathons with prizes ranging from large chunks of cash to experiences where winners receive tours of their facilities and the ability to talk to the engineers working on the cutting edge of the technology.Kaggle is a company founded in Melbourne that moved to Silicon Valley and raised significant cash from the likes of Max Levchin (PayPal Mafia) before being bought out by Google. Kaggle has openly accessible datasets for ML and data science autodidacts and holds competitions based on certain datasets and problems. In some of these competitions people who had no previous experience in machine learning outside of watching an online Stanford lecture series were able to produce better models than the best engineers in the industry.Readers should understand I am not just telling you these things for the fuck of it, maybe you should actually go check some of this shit out.Hackers: Richard Stallman, Linus Torvalds, Linux and the Open Source MovementThe Open-Source movement is another source of autodidactism encouraged by techies. It is a decentralised approach to programming with the principal that everyone has access to the source code which they are allowed to use (of course you should always credit) for their own projects. Because of this approach it allows rapid progress and avoids transactions costs. There have been many massively successful Open-Source projects.In the beginning software was essentially Open-Source, people would just pass around code, it was not until around 1980 that software began to become much more proprietary. Of course this ground the gears of many engineers and computer scientists at the time because it meant they could not alter the code for their desired application. The blame for this lies at the feet of some of the big tech firms, Microsoft was one of the companies responsible for the push to proprietary, this is how Gates developed his big bad caricature, there is of course a little bit of merit in this push for proprietary.Richard StallmanRichard Stallman loved the dynamism of the pre-proprietary age of software and was disheartened by how proprietary software was erecting barriers and preventing innovation. So in 1983 he founded the free software foundation. Stallman realised that if he created his own operating system then the decentralised fun could continue. So he created GNU which stands for ‘GNU Not Unix’ a funny way of saying it was like Unix but was not Unix because Unix was proprietary. GNU software is a free copyleft license, here is a description from their website:“To copyleft a program, we first state that it is copyrighted; then we add distribution terms, which are a legal instrument that gives everyone the rights to use, modify, and redistribute the program’s code, or any program derived from it, but only if the distribution terms are unchanged. Thus, the code and the freedoms become legally inseparable.” -gnu.org/copyleft [15]“wherever the software goes the freedom follows” — Stallman [16]“The crucial thing about GNU is that it is free software. Now free software refers not to price but to freedom so think of free speech, not free beer. The freedoms that I am talking about are the freedoms to make changes you want to or hire somebody else to make changes for you if you are using the software for your business, to redistribute copies to share with other people and to make improvements and publish them so that other people can get the benefit of them too. Now those are the freedoms that distinguish free software from non-free software. These are the freedoms that enable people to form a community.” — Stallman [16]So you have the right to download, redistribute and modify software with a copyleft license but then you too must make your modifications available under the same constraints. The actual license used is a copyleft license known as the GNU public license. If software is proprietary it is possible only one company has access to the source code, so they have a hidden monopoly on support, this is why for example microsoft has such terrible support compared to Linux. This framework created a positive set of incentives for a community of tinkerers to form and allowed what Wolfram described in the earlier quote as roughly ~ “the discipline becomes institutionalised” to be avoided.Many elements of GNU are still used today. Everyone who has taken an introductory course in C has probably used GCC (GNU Compiler Collection).Ironically enough very few on the mainstream or even radical left seem to mention Richard Stallman in fact I cannot remember an instance of him being cited by them. Despite Stallman and Chomsky both residing at MIT they did not meet until 2015, they did eventually meet though — something that is worth pointing out. This paragraph is basically just meant to shit on academic leftism and its inability to adopt practical approaches, as the free software movement was the closest thing you would get to successful anarcho-communism in recent history.Linus TorvaldsLinus Torvalds came to fill in the missing component of the new operating system in 1991. The GNU project had designed the peripheral technologies but the OS (operating system) still needed a kernel. Before the GNU project finished its kernal Torvalds came along with a kernel called Linux and if you are reading this on your phone and it’s an android you are running the Linux kernel right now. Torvalds did not develop the kernel for the GNU project but he had similar ideals about having an open-source approach. Linux then adopted the GNU peripherals and the GPL (GNU Public License) and a new open-source OS was born.The Linux OS is now the OS used for servers across the world. Linux has won the server market, thanks to Google’s Android OS (which is also open-source) it also dominates the mobile phone market (after the death of the windows phone the only smart phone not running a Linux based OS is the iPhone). The short story here is that Linux is an amazingly powerful technology but it was not created by any bureaucracy it is thanks to a decentralised approach with countless engineers involved.There were a few hiccups in realising a decentralised approach, Torvalds thought the current services available were holding development back. So he left the Linux project for a few months and came back with Git which was released on the 7th of April 2005. Git is a technology that enables more effective decentralised organisation and code management for large projects.In 2008 GitHub a code-repository based on Git was founded, on June 4th 2018 is was acquired by Microsoft for $7.5 Billion. Today GitHub or similar platforms are used by almost every programmer and tech company on the planet for their code repositories and projects. A new programmer new to Java such as myself may wish to create Pong as an introductory project, thanks to GitHub I have access to many others who have coded the game and can compare code making it much easier to learn.Why do we need Universities degrees again?If you think coding is an exception and most degrees could not be learned through an autodidactic approach you should pause for a minute and understand what you are saying.Good coding is highly technical and sub-disciplines like machine learning require reasonably complex mathematics relative to other things. Unless your degree is in the natural sciences or engineering there is absolutely no need to do your degree in person at a University. If your argument is about social or soft-skills for commerce these could be developed from experience in industry. As for the humanities and social sciences it is obvious it would be far easier to teadch them online than to teach coding online. As for the consumption good function of the University that could easily be served in a different setting, young people will find ways and reasons to party. If your argument is that you require the University to impose deadlines on you and it provides an incentive structure then we should be asking why we need to saddle people with the threat of tens of thousands of dollars of debt just to get them to complete their degrees and maybe if you need to be threatened like that you should not be taking the course in the first place.Well maybe the University makes you a good researcher? I would be highly sceptical of this seeing as for most undergraduate subjects with scope for research essays (arts) have predetermined readings and essay questions are mandated. Well maybe University… you see there is nothing really the University does for students they could not get from a variety of separate services that would do those jobs much better and for much less.Democratisation of information => Monopolisation of attentionThe natural consequence of exposure to the internet will be the obliteration of 90% of Universities (provided market forces are permitted to prevail of course). Take a look at sports or music, after they were exposed to mediums that allowed large numbers of people to view them at their convenience, television and the internet respectively, a very small number of athletes and performers captured most of the attention. People would rather watch the best of the best, than have an excessive abundance of just good, it makes sense after all people have a finite amount of time. The same trend prevails in Hollywood actors and unfortunately increasingly with CEOs and Politicians.Provided regulation does not get in the way then this too will extend itself to University degrees because there are massive efficiency gains. Why would you learn from some second rate lecturer who would prefer to be in the lab or doing research when you could learn your linguistics from Ivy League Professors like Noam Chomsky or John McWhorter (host of lexicon valley podcast, check it out), who are both great at articulating the core concepts and are at the forefront of the science. Imagine and I think it is possible — that someone was able to create a faithful recreation of all the Feynman lectures that would make redundant all the first and second year physics lecturers and clearly too the benefit of the students.In a world of free markets the undergraduate business will depart the University and that is the healthiest outcome in my view. We would prevent any further students in the United States from getting wrapped up in the Student Debt Crisis which far from increasing social mobility is likely to perpetuate inequalities. It is too obvious why has it not already happened?! Good question do not fret we shall return to answer this question but I hope at least the reader is beginning to see a theme emerge.The Last Step: Coming After Physics — 50 years of not so much?Disclaimer: A lot of what I am about to say does not apply to the Astrophysicists and the Condensed Matter people.What is a physicist?A physicist is someone who looks to see if current theory is closed over itself and reality under some sensible operation. This function cannot be well performed by a priesthood.Isaac NewtonCase 1: Isaac Newton was in every sense an outsider at Cambridge. Most of his greatest work was done when he was hiding away in his room at Trinity being an utter recluse or during the plague years when he returned home. Newton worked outside the establishment — he had to, he had a definite plan to tinker and find out the laws of the Universe. His work on optics and his later work as an investigator of monetary fraud proved that he had a very practical hands on mind, his head was not all in the clouds.James WattCase 2:James Watt was an outsider too. He earned his prestige through his inventions, most important of which was the massive improvement he made to the efficiency of the steam engine. Watt never received a University degree, he did an apprenticeship as a scientific instrument maker in London for about a year and then returned to Glasgow to start up a shop selling instruments to scientists. He distrusted publishing papers and preferred to pursue patents instead.Benjamin FranklinCase 3:Benjamin Franklin was another outsider. Franklin received the Copley Medal from the Royal Society and honourary degrees from Harvard and Yale but he never attended University. His inventions stretch far and wide and obviously he made many contributions to politics and was a great statesman, it is worth saying this was by no means evident from birth — Franklin was social climber of the highest order, the original American Dream.Michael FaradayCase 4: Michael Faraday too was an outsider. He came from nothing, he learned what he knew about the world from his job working in a printing house where he would read the sheets of paper as he assembled them into books. He managed to get a job at the Royal Society by impressing Humphry Davy. Einstein kept a picture of him on his wall, alongside Newton and Maxwell. Faraday is notorious for lacking any mathematical skill whatever, but as Rutherford put it,When we consider the magnitude and extent of his discoveries and their influence on the progress of science and of industry, there is no honour too great to pay to the memory of Faraday, one of the greatest scientific discoverers of all time.-RutherfordFaraday was the greatest tinkerer of all time. Among many other great inventions and ideas the electric motor stands out as it revolutionised not only our society but our understanding of the universe (remember this man had no formal education).Nikola TeslaCase 5:Nikola Tesla was an outsider. Tesla dropped out before finishing his degree. He built on the work of Faraday and constructed the first alternating current motor, generator and transmission system. If you are reading this online you are on a Tesla powered device, if you have a battery powered device it was charged by a Tesla grid. The work of Faraday and Tesla — outsiders — kicked off an engineering revolution that powered the growth from 1920–1970.You know whoCase 6:Einstein was exceptional and like these others he was not a big fan of University — he passed. In fact later in life he would leap at the opportunity to help set up the Institute for Advanced Studies where guess what — there was no teaching and they accepted no one with an undergrad degree! Some of his best work was done when he was at the patent office and there is a famous quote from his time there.“The origin of all technical achievements is the divine curiosity and the play instinct of the working and thinking researcher, as well as the constructive fantasy of the technical inventor.” -AE from time at patent office.“Scientists investigate that which already is; engineers create that which has never been.” — Albert EinsteinStopping here is arbitrary I could continue but I don’t want to bore you to death.SuperString Theory A Whole Lotta Nothin?In the last 50 years physics has become institutionalised. This coincides with very few engineers working on problems relating to theoretical physics. Supersymmetric particles were not observed at the right energy levels in the large hadron collider. How did we get here?In the last 50 years in theoretical physics there has been an entirely self-policing community. This lead to expert problems, peer-review does not help if you are not connected to the outside world in some way. In fact peer-review is a scam, it is a recent addition and is used to suppress new ideas, the right ideas will rise to the top, physics does not really need peer review.Ed Witten is the super genius that turned theoretical physicists into mathematicians. His merging of the various Superstring theories to many people seemed too good to be true and so a generation of progress was loss down this particular rabbit hole, there are some remarkable things about this theory — for example if it were correct it predicted a WIMP (weakly interacting massive particle) that would have accounted for dark matter.If I can stretch my argument to the Queen of all sciences being distorted and warped by the modern University then how much more do you want from me?! Huh? Do not worry the synthesis is coming soon.Ideology and Determination Pt 2, The Millennials — Definite PessimismMost economic fallacies derive from the tendency to assume that there is a fixed pie, that one party can gain only at the expense of another.- Milton FreedmanThe Millenials are definite pessimists they know the world is going to get worse and they know how it is going to get worse. Climate Change, Global Capitalist Exploitation, Big Corporations, Alienated Labour, Automation and Wealth Inequality. Lacking any creativity they see the government as the solution to everything. They like their Boomer parents believe in societal institutions but only the ones they agree with, the leftist media, the Universities, HR Departments. They hate their predicament so much that they have turned against society, with their postmodern philosophy they seek to seize control of institutions to get what they want, not what is good.I will refrain from going to deep on this subject because it deserves its own 10,000 word essay just to begin to list the fallacies and contradictions present in the ideology of the generation. For now I will suffice to show that it is impossible for Governments, Universities or Corporations to give them what they want.In summary humanity’s current course is unsustainable — this is what the millennials get right — but what they do not get is that you will never convince people to lower their standard of living and if everyone in the world wants the standard of living we have in the West with current technologies no amount of government intervention is going to make that work the only way out is innovation. You can prove this purely from the perspective of resources — and your paper/metal/no straws are not going to fix this.Taleb — Antifragility: Bigger is Badder and Smaller is SexierDamocles, The Phoenix and The Hydra:Antifragile is a word that has been introduced into the English language by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, as he could not find a word for the kind of phenomenon he was trying to describe, since there was no word for the kind of thing he was trying to describe in English or in several other languages. There is some intuition building required for this topic so I will introduce it in a similar way to how Taleb does in his book, with my own spin on it. [22]DamoclesThe story of Damocles comes down to us from Cicero in his Tusculanae Disputationes, the story takes place Sicily when it was under the rule of Dionysus II who Plato had a go at taming and training into a Philosopher King, he got himself imprisoned for his trouble.Damocles under the sword hung up by a horse’s hairDamocles got himself in trouble with Dionysus II by praising him and how happy he was a little too vigorously. Dionysus II was massively paranoid and so did not live a very happy life. To help Damocles realise how unhappy he was he had Damocles lie on a bed of gold embroided and wrought with high taste, he then ordered some good looking youths to wait on a table and give Damocles whatever he desired, etc etc. Damocles basically had all the luxuries he could possibly desire. Damocles thought this was pretty good, but into this arrangement Dionysus introduced a sword to hang down over Damocles head from above suspended by but a horse hair. The end of the story is interesting but it diverges from our interest in how we can use it as an analogy here. Damocles in this state has all he could desire and as long as he can forget about the sword he has a very stable and pleasant existence provided of course the hair does not snap. This is the incomplete analogy for fragility but serves to help build the intuition somewhat, Damocles life is highly subject to disorder.PhoenixThe Analogy for stability is the Phoenix. When a Phoenix dies it bursts into flames and it is reborn from the ashes. Whatever you do you remain static to disorder.HydraFinally the analogy for antifragility is the hydra. If you cut of the head of a hydra, then two more grow back. The hydra is not simply robust, resilient or stable it is antifragile. The Hydra gains from disorder, the more disorder the hydra is exposed to the stronger it becomes. We want the human society to be a hydra.Examples of real life antifragility:Mithridates of Pontus is a hell of a character I recommend looking up. Anywho for reasons we won’t go into here the man was one of the first to discover you could build up a tolerance to poison. Over a period of many years he slowly increased the dose such that if someone tried to poison him he would be able to survive. In this example the body is the antifragile sytem as it overcompensates — it does not simply resist the poison it overcompensates becoming capable of enduring larger doses.Another example is weightlifting, after a session of training the body overcompensates such that next time you lift you can lift more than you could lift before.Fasting is also an example where we see antifragile effects. There are many documented benefits of fasting and caloric restriction, so that afterward the body is actually healthier than prior to the fast.Temperature variation — saunas and cold showers — also seem to have beneficial effects.Many biological systems display the characteristics of antifragility. Antifragility is an essential element for any self-replicator if it is going to survive in a Universe where entropy is always driving things toward disorder. Stability is not good enough, if you aim for stability in a Universe where disorder prevails you will fail, but if you aim for anti-fragility you may get stability or even better.The innards of the beastsHow do you create an antifragile system?Let us look at the Elephant and the Mouse. Kleiber’s Law states that metabolic rate obeys a power law. If q is the metabolic rate then q ~ M^(3/4). This means it is better to bigger if you take a naive approach as you will be more efficient per unit mass (sublinear scaling). It turns out the circulatory, neural and respiratory systems also follow a quarter power law.Allegedly Kleiber’s Original PlotGeoffrey West Particle Physicist turned Biologist (see also Enquist and Brown) argues this is due to network existing in 3 dimensions and trying to fill the space leading to a fractal geometry and in a sense an attempt to stretch out into the 4th dimension leading to integer multiples of power 1/4.A clearer plot, it is log log to turn power law into linearIf you want to understand the idea here I recommend this 3Blue1Brown video on space-filling curves: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU0wScIj36oIf you want to go even a little deeper than that you should check out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB9n2gHsHN4West states several key principles that unite the biological systems he studies: All biological systems function by way of networks, which transport energy, matter or information.1: The network is space-filling (fractal geometry)2: Terminal Units Are Invariant (Capillaries in a blue whale ~ in size to capillaries in humans, for example, analogy is imagine if electrical plugs scaled with building size — it would not work, capillaries are servicing cells of similar size therefore they too must be of similar size)3: That over time biological organisms become optimized over the course of evolution[17] [18] [19] [20]Space filling plant vascular system in a leafSince biological systems tend to be antifragile with respect to many kinds of disorder we should seek to replicate these principles in our society at large but before we move onto humans we should say a little more about elephants.Mice vs ElephantsIf a meteor were to hit planet Earth mice have a decent chance of surviving whereas elephants do not. In fact it is believed that mammals survived the meteor that killed the dinosaurs because a small shrew like creature was able to survive. It is suspected this is because the meteor induced a nuclear winter and there was not sufficient food for megafauna to survive, it is worth noting in the medium term megafauna do perform better though because they can fast for extended duration but even though they are metabolically more efficient they still require a larger baseline energy consumption and so if resources are made more scarce then their populations will suffer or go extinct. There are also many more mice than elephants which trivially makes it more difficult to kill them all. Another advantage for mice is that they are immune to fall damage, you can throw a mouse out of a window and they will be fine this is because of the surface area to volume ratio, mice have much more surface area to distribute the mass of their insides over than elephants do, this will mean that elephants will explode if you drop them from high enough and mice will be fine. The surface area to mass ratio has consequences for terminal velocity meaning that elephants hit the ground much harder as well.While it is true that individual elephants are much more resilient to many forms of disorder in the short term than mice are, they are much more susceptible to fat-tailed risks or extreme events like climate change. Most of the major mega fauna died out at the end of the ice age, it is suspected that humans were partly responsible but for many it was because their baseline energy consumption was too high when the climate warmed many had an insufficient energy supply and went extinct, so their increased metabolic efficiency did not matter. So to have an antifragile population actually means distributing the risk of the population out to the individuals.Of Elephants and MenTo put it simply in the short-term there is a trade-off to being antifragile, you will lose efficiency. The nature of antifragility means that long term you will actually make more progress because your system will gain from disorder whereas the fragile efficient system will collapse. To overcome the disorder you will need a radical restructuring which will likely kick off an S-Curve growth spurt. This means if you become institutionalised you can be very good at what you do right now, in fact better than if you continued to innovate but after exposed to a certain form of disorder things will begin to break down, that can happen quickly through something catastrophic or slowly through decay and corruption.If you look at our society at present we are highly geared toward efficient fragile systems, for example constant M&As to increase efficiency at the cost of long term risk to society at large — because the entire industry could be lost, which of course cannot be stomached, we then have to bailout the corporation — thwarting the market which is telling us that the company/companies in question are too large.Keynesianism and the deployment of MMT is a disaster — the economy is in the worst state it has ever been in because we decided to bail out corporations that were fragile and which should have gone bust, (the banks and the big auto makers).Keynes lost the debate with Hayek by mistaking the symptom for the disease, a sudden lack of liquidity in the market does not just happen it is caused by something — in the case of the GFC it was caused by the financial sector by using quantitative easing in this scenario you are perpetuating a moral hazard. If we keep medicating the economy to suppress the symptoms while the disease continues to spread then eventually the dollar will collapse under the weight of its own delusion — I will leave this comment here because I am not sufficiently educated on macroeconomics but this seems so obvious I cannot imagine any theory that would convince me otherwise.We also see fragility in Just-In-Time manufacturing and supplying, if one element of the supply chain has a mishap entire production ceases until that issue is resolved. Half the things in this essay I had not even heard of before I just predicted it from the theory of antifragility — it is obvious that it should not work — google it and sure enough people are complaining about how Just-In-Time production broke down during the fat-tailed catastrophe of 2011 the Japanese Earthquake and Tsunami. The generality and simplicity of the theory is what makes antifragility so compelling.The implication of the trade-off between antifragility and short-term stability is little innovation and highly standardised and regular outcomes — I feel like I have to keep saying this in the short term!. This is what I have sought to illustrate with all the previous examples in this essay. Other industries that get subsidies or tax rebates for dubious reasons will have the same outcomes. Universities are one such institution that is allowed to exist despite it being incredibly fragile and deleterious to society. Universities now train people to become incompetent and incapable of dealing with the real world while dialing up their hubris. They are the organs of highly standardised outcomes — they are unlikely to produce revolutions in any technology if they do it is because the researcher succeeded despite them. The tax break is like being constantly bailed out relative to the rest of society and through regulatory frameworks (see TEQSA) they maintain their grips on degrees and thus accreditation, Universities are socialism!We know big is bad, that distributed networks display antifragility and centralised ones do not, simply because centralised systems centralise fat-tail risk.Finding a fix:[24]: Various different attractors, (Local minima to occupy). See Jim Rutt’s medium pieceFractal localism — The Political Solution — The 5th Attractor (Game B)In fractal localism, localities have power over their surroundings, states have power over issues that collectively concern their localities and countries have power over issues that collectively concern the states, 3 levels is arbitrary it is just that we have names for those 3 levels it could be 7 levels or 9 levels there will be diminishing returns though. If you want another example of bad governance because a nation level governing body thinks it knows everything look up NHS vs Scottish NHS (hint: they devolved the power to a lower level and it functions better).I could keep rattling on about this forever but I feel I have given sufficient examples of how things go wrong when you have large short term efficient fragile systems and how things can go amazingly well when you do not.So I will basically leave it at this, there are no positive rights at the federal level that is exceedingly stupid if there are they can certainly not be administered by a central authority, at best they can be overseen, to advocate for central authority is to enshrine fragility into the system from the get go. The further away you are from the terminal unit the more broad and inconsequential your policies should be for that terminal unit (whether it be the family or the individual).Government needs to get out of business too. No more bailouts, no tax breaks (one uniform logical tax system), no subsidies for any industry. It needs long term strategic planning an financing for very specific things. The federal level is for the military and foreign policy, the federal level should have very little to do with domestic policy outside of large infrastructure projects.On the side of corporations a lot of thought needs to go into rethinking the structure of the current market and publicly traded assets. People get crazy about changes, I do too because normally they are interventions that distort natural pressures but some of the systems in the economy we have accepted for default and without really asking the deep question of whether they serve the axioms of a free markets, systems that do not need to be modified.Ideology and Determination Pt 3 The Greatest Generation and the Zoomers or Bloomers?I hate people who complain all the time without presenting solutions. So this will be the solution to the ideology question.Very few people read past the first few pages of a book so you should always put the juicy stuff at the start. King James Genesis begins with God creating the world from undifferentiated nothing with the spoken word he willed it into existence and it was good. God created man in his image — and all this in the first chapter of genesis. In the time of the Greatest Generation the church was a much larger part of people’s life there was a belief that creation itself is good and noble. The universe is not morally relative not all combinations are morally equivalent and moving the universe towards some combinations is good. If one looks at the world this way one can be a definite optimist, God had a plan for creation and he executed it and it was good and he made humans in his image, which means that humans can create things that are good, (one should be careful not to go too far with this and actually become religious).The second thing that characterised the Greatest Generation was that they believed in their countries and their local communities. They had skin in the game. Their parents had lived through WW1, some of them did not know their fathers because they had died in the war. Many of them would later fight in WW2 themselves. They had shared experience of tragedy and were bound together by it. Politicians also had skin in the game, their children would go off to fight in the wars, Churchill wanted to have his skin in the game and did at several points. He planned on watching the D-day landings from HMS Belfast but King George VI persuaded him not to by threatening that he would go with Churchill.This is another idea of Taleb’s in fact he a whole book named after it. If we want to get back in the business of innovating and become prosperous once more then we need to create structures where people have Skin in the Game. Thiel’s advice for venture capitalists and entrepreneurs is that the CEO should always earn the least, that way he has the most skin in the game — the employees will know he believes in the success of the enterprise as his entire pay off will be from equity when the company succeeds.It was not until the second half of the 20th century that the protestant work ethic was torn down and America stopped being a single country and became two. The puritan belief in hard work and creating new things is what we need but all things in moderation. We should all try to be a little bit more Ben Franklin.P.S. I never got to mention that there were more startups in the US in the 1980s than there are today despite massive population increase.References:[1]: C.(2017), Australians pursuing higher education in record numbers.

Probability Distributions —A Primer,https://medium.com/@NMeyen/probability-distributions-a-primer-bedd58b436e5?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"Mathematics,Math,Statistics,Probability","As observed by scientists through the centuries, probability (and statistics) has been seen to underpin a lot of natural phenomena be it the distribution of heights of students in a classroom, to Born’s Rule for quantum systems (this was the reason for which Albert Einstein complained about God playing dice with the universe). Today probability and statistics taught at classrooms and undergraduate levels, ease the beginner to intuitively ‘grasp’ the concept of probability by usually introducing it as a mathematical concept which follows certain axioms , laying the foundations for more concepts such as random variables and probability distributions.Photo Courtesy : https://ih1.redbubble.net — Albert Einstein’s famous quote about God not playing diceWhen considering probability distribution functions (or probability mass functions, as they are known in the case of discrete variables) it is pretty interesting to note that there are many such distribution functions, which have been observed in nature and that it is not easy to keep track of them all when trying to figure out which distribution is applicable when. The purpose of this article is to list down a few of them and when they are applicable, but please note that the list is by no means exhaustive. There is also a cheat sheet at the end which highlights the relationships among the different distributions.Discrete UniformThe discrete uniform distribution is one of the more simpler distributions to understand in that each outcome is equiprobable and therefore symmetric as well. Take the example of throwing a die. Assuming a fair die the probability of landing a number from 1 to 6 is 1/6 and is equal for all possible outcomes.PoissonThe Poisson distribution is another discrete probability distribution which expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space if these events occur with a known constant mean rate and independently of the time since the last event. The Poisson distribution is typically used to measure physical events in specified intervals along dimensions such as distance, area or volume.BinomialThe Binomial distribution models the number of successes in a sequence of n independent events, each with a binary outcome, where each event in the sequence is independent of each other. This distribution can be considered as an extension of the Bernoulli distribution of one event to n independent events. The most commonly cited example of the Binomial distribution is the probability distribution of a multiple number of coin tosses.GeometricThe geometric distribution models the number of failures before the first success and similar assumptions for the binomial distribution holds under this model as well.HypergeometricThe Hypergeometric distribution is also similar to the Binomial distribution but differs in one key aspect in that while the Binomial distribution considers modeling successes with replacement in the case of the Hypergeometric distribution what is modeled is the number of successes without replacement. An example of the practical usage of the Hypergeometric distribution would be of the capture-and-recapture method in Ecology.UniformThe continuous uniform distribution is an example of a symmetric continuous probability distribution. The most common usage of the continuous uniform distribution is in how it is used as the base on which to generate pseudo-random numbers for other continuous probability distributions.NormalThe normal distribution is probably one of the most important distributions out there because of its relationship to the Central Limit Theorem. It states that, under some conditions, the average of many samples (observations) of a random variable with finite mean and variance is itself a random variable — whose distribution converges to a normal distribution as the number of samples increases. Some examples of where the normal distribution are used are for example in standardized testing.ExponentialThe exponential distribution is the probability distribution of the time between events in a Poisson point process, i.e., a process in which events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate. It is a special case of the gamma distribution.GammaThe Gamma distribution is a continuous probability distribution function with support on the interval 0 to infinity and is also widely used as a conjugate prior in Bayesian statistical applications.BetaThe Beta distribution is continuous probability distribution function with support on the interval 0 to 1 and is another widely used conjugate prior in Bayesian statistical applications.While the above highlights a few of the probability distributions out there as I mentioned earlier by no stretch of imagination is it exhaustive. Also if you are interested in checking out how these distributions are related to each other please check the image below from Statistical Inference — 2nd Edition by George Casella and Roger L.

Answering Gracie Cunningham’s Mathematics Questions,https://medium.com/@dgoldman0/answering-gracie-cunninghams-mathematics-questions-887144c7c19a?source=tag_archive---------4-----------------------,"Mathematics,Questions,History,Twitter,Tik Tok","Photo by Antoine Dautry on UnsplashRecently, a TikTok video by Gracie Cunningham went viral. She received a lot of negative attention, but also plenty of defense for her video. To be blunt, the questions in her first video were apathetic at best, and much of her claims were outright false.Part of the problem rests with the “education” system, but each individual also has a responsibility to seek out knowledge and better themselves. Luckily, after the viral response of her first video, Cunningham produced a second video that did ask some interesting questions.Questions and AnswersIn the second video, the questions were more honest, and they are worth answering. Apathy should be criticized, but true inquisitiveness should always be honored.Question #1: How did people know what they were looking for when they started theorizing about formulas?Technically, formulas as written today are a modern invention. The ancient Greeks described their mathematics in detailed sentences. Honestly, it was quite inefficient, so it’s great that modern algebra was eventually developed. The Greeks had to write everything out in very complicated ways.There is also something in mathematics called a theorem, which is a mathematical statement that can potentially be proven or disproven and which forms a major component of an area in mathematics. An example of a theorem is the Pythagorean Theorem.That being said, the question of how mathematicians develop or discover mathematical concepts is an interesting one. Often times, there’s a problem that the mathematician wishes to answer. There are also usually existing attempts to find these answers. Mathematicians use a combination of intuition and trial and error the develop new mathematics.Intuition and a lot of experience helps a lot. Often times a mathematician will gain a “feel” for how a system works, and they can start to develop theorems. For this reason, mathematics is as much an art as it is anything else.Question #2: Once they did find these formulas, how did they know that they were right?Proofs. Over many thousands of years, a complex system of proving statements in mathematics has been developed. These proofs start with basic axioms. These axioms are not proven. They are taken at face value as being true, usually because they fit some kind of common understanding about reality.For instance, the law of non-contradiction asserts that two statements which contradict each other cannot both be true. We have no way to prove this statement, but it would be a bizarre universe indeed if two contradictory mathematical statements could both actually be true, a topic that I mention in Ramblings on a Paraconsistent Reality.Admittedly, all our proofs do rely on the existence of some axioms that we take for granted. If those axioms are wrong, our proofs fail. There are also times when there are no proofs, but numerous attempts to find a counter example for a theorem, formula, etc fail, and so we assume that it’s correct.There are however plenty of open questions in mathematics to this day. Some of these questions have real world importance, including questions in computer science about computability and encryption.Question #3: Why is everyone being really mean to me on Twitter?I can’t answer why others criticized the original video. But I can explain my issue with it. The original video showed apathy, as I mentioned in the beginning of this article. There were also numerous false statements that were made. If the video had been created in a more serious way, and some effort was taken to actually seek answers, people likely would have been less critical. I know that I would have been more than happy to answer an honest question. Unfortunately, that’s not how things went down.I mentioned these issues in my reply to Zulie Rane’s article on the topic.The Greeks didn’t have technology? Uh right. Okay then… How about the Antikythera Mechanism? Admittedly, it was a later development, but there was plenty of technology. Also, a lot of the technology that we have today exists only because of the mathematics developed in the past.Speaking of technology and false statements that this person made, the ancient Greeks had plumbing. They had entire sewer systems.y = mx+b is a modern way to describe a line. Algebra as it exists today was not around during the time of the ancient GreeksWhile many of the ancient Greek scholars did study these topics for spiritual reasons, so to speak, the mathematics that Pythagoras* and many other mathematicians developed at the time were instrumental in civic engineering and other activities.Note that the “Pythagorean” theorem was actually first developed in China long before Pythagoras was bornWe live in an era where most of humanity’s knowledge is at our fingertips, both in unstructured and structured forms, including free Coursera courses. I absolutely blame the school system for failing to foster a love of learning, but much of the responsibility falls on the individual themselves, especially when they put themselves out there in such a public way. The original video showed a complete lack of interest in actually learning, while also expressing numerous false statements.Written byDaniel GoldmanI’m a polymath and a rōnin scholar.

History,https://medium.com/@chandramani05/grahams-number-b12863a866b7?source=tag_archive---------5-----------------------,"Numbers,Mathematics,Number Theory","Sometimes when we talk about big numbers, we talk about how many digits they have or write them in scientific notions involving some power of 10. A googol, for example, is 10¹⁰⁰ which has 101 digits. The largest known prime number has over 17 million digits. A googolplex is 10 raised to the googol power so it has approximately googol digits. It takes a while to write down 1 followed by 100 zeroes. But we can do it. But Graham’s number is different. I can’t tell you how many digits it has. I even can’t tell you how many digits it’s a number of digits has, or how many digits the number of digits of its number of digits it has. They are all too big.HistoryThe number was published in the 1980 Guinness Book of World Record after the popular Science writer Martin Gardner described it in the “Mathematical Games” Section of Scientific November in 1977 as “abound so vast that it holds the record for the largest specific positive integer ever to have been used in a published mathematical proof at the time of introduction. Many ‘scientists describe it probably “close enough” to infinity.How Large is Graham’s NumberGraham’s number is a number so unimaginably big that if were to fully comprehend it’s the size your brain will literally collapse into the black hole.10⁸: Number of Books ever published in Human History.10¹⁰: Years since the big bang and number of seconds since Jesus Christ Lived.10¹¹: Number of stars in the Milky Way.10¹⁷: The number of seconds since the Big Bang.10⁸⁰: Common Estimate for the number of atoms in the Universe.10¹⁰⁰: The NUmber of grain sands that could fit into the Universe.10¹²²: Number of Protons you could fit into the Universe.Now this is the part where Maths start getting involvedGraham's Number is connected to the following problem in Ramsey Theory: Connect each pair of Geometric Vertices of an n-dimensional hypercube to obtain a complete graph of 2n vertices. Color each of the edges of this graph either red or blue. What is the smallest value of n for which every such coloring contains at least one-single coloring contains at least one-single colored complete subgraph on four coplanar vertices?3↑3 = ³³ = 3x3x3 = 273↑↑3 = 7.6 trillion.3↑↑↑↑3 = G1 — This no is unimaginably big and can break any calculator in this world. This is already bigger than we can even comprehend3↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑3 = G2 3↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑3 = G33↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑3= G4Representation of Graham NimberAnd these numbers exponentially grow at an insane rate all the way up to G64. G64 is Graham’s Number. It's so big, the Universe does not contain enough stuff on which to write it’s digits. Any civilizations, computers; humans, or anything can’t store this enormous number. But it’s finite, it’s also a whole number and despite it being so mind-boggling huge we know it is divisible by 3 and ends in a 7. This is the beauty of Mathematics.Graham’s number is much larger than many other larger numbers such as Skewes’ number and Moser’s Number, both of which are in turn much larger than a googolplex. As with these, it is so large that the observable Universe is far too contain an ordinary digital representation of Graham’s Number, assuming that each digit occupies one Planck’s Volume (10^(-35) cm), possible the smallest measurable space. But even the number of digits in this digital representation of Graham’s Number would itself be a number so large that its digital representation can not be represented in the observable number. Nor even can the number of digit’s of that number- and so forth.Tower of Power of 3The thing that we love about Graham’s number is that this unimaginably large quantity isn’t some theoretical concept: it’s an exact number. We know it’s a whole number, in fact, it’s easy to see this number is multiple of three because of the way it’s easy to see this number is a multiple of three because of the way it is defined as a tower of powers of three. And mathematicians have learned a lot about the processes used to define Graham’s number, including the fact that once a power tower is tall enough the right-most decimal digits will eventually remain the same, no matter how many more levels you add to your towers of powers. Graham’s number may be too big to write, but we know it ends in seven.Its beauty of Mathematics that not only has the power to define the unimaginable but to also investigate it too.Written byChandramaniWandering and Wondering in the world of theoretical physics |Software Developer @Samsung | Insta @chandramani05Follow24 24 24 NumbersMathematicsNumber TheoryMore from ChandramaniFollowWandering and Wondering in the world of theoretical physics |Software Developer @Samsung | Insta @chandramani05More From MediumTeaching Summation Using Ruby’s Enumerable#reduce MethodAron FilbertThe Beauty of Mathematical SimplicityWaldo Otis in However, MathematicsLatent probabilistic modeling (Part 1)Adrien Biarnes in Analytics VidhyaCan you solve these 19th-century math problems?katherineluckEngineering TruismsScott McKean10 Mathematical Equations That Changed The WorldMaurizio Sluijmers in The StartupClocks and OscillatorsJames Thorniley in The StartupZero is nothing but a numberWaldo Otis in However, MathematicsAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Top Homeschool Math Curriculum for Students in Need,https://medium.com/dev-genius/top-homeschool-math-curriculum-for-students-in-need-cf6fde4b4822?source=tag_archive---------6-----------------------,"Homeschooling,Mathematics,Students,Education,Parenting","It comes as no surprise to see students struggling with Mathematics. To understand and perfect its complex topics, most students have to invest a lot of time and effort. But despite all their efforts, they still find the subject too difficult to tackle on their own. Statistics show that — Over 80% of students take longer to grasp mathematical concepts than any other subject. However, to help struggling students, homeschool math curriculum(s) have proven very useful in recent years.Its unique teaching textbooks come with step-by-step guidance and answers to numerous math lessons. And they help improve a kid’s thinking capability to understand on their own.How A Proper Homeschool Math Curriculum Helps Struggling Students?A quality homeschool math curriculum helps struggling students understand how math works. It contains all the key answers and directions to essential questions that students learn to apply on their own. Thus math concepts of your child start to grow from the beginning of the school year.These homeschool math programs educate students on those crucial formulas and use them in both their academic equations and real-life.Furthermore, such grade-level maths curriculums do not endorse spoon-feed learning to students. Instead, it helps improve a student’s math skills through reading, understanding, and self-applying those concepts in different equations. This helps foster in-depth learning, which students don’t forget.Most importantly, a quality homeschool math curriculum will feature lots of problem-solving examples, unique illustrations, and video lessons. Each of them will be easy to follow for students and help them excel in their academics.It’s no secret that every child comes with unique abilities. And the purpose of online homeschool mathematics curriculums is to equip and educate students thoroughly so that they thrive confidently.This brings to the all-important question — “Are you among those homeschooling moms searching for the best homeschool math curriculum(s)?”If so, then continue reading below!Top Homeschool Math Curriculum(s) For Mastery-Based Learning1.

The Viral Math Girl From TikTok Perfectly Encapsulates What It’s Like to Be Female Online,https://medium.com/better-marketing/the-viral-math-girl-from-tiktok-perfectly-encapsulates-what-its-like-to-be-female-online-f5bebbfb08a9?source=tag_archive---------7-----------------------,"Culture,Digital Culture,Equality,Social Media,Mathematics","Source: TikTokI was browsing Twitter, as I try to avoid doing too much these days, and I came across a viral video (12.1 million views) shared by @aleturner, saying it was the dumbest one she’d ever seen.I was intrigued. In it, a young blond woman applied makeup for work while discoursing freely on how the concept of mathematics came to be. She asked questions like, “who came up with this concept?” and “how would you start on the concept of algebra?”The initial reaction was one of mockery. People were quick to dismiss her and call her and her video “dumb.” Simply because she was young, blonde, and said “like” and “stuff” a lot, commentators determined that her questions were invalid and that the education system should have done a better job of explaining math to her.First of all, the questions she was asking were actually very good. Philosopher and math college professors themselves have said that her questions were valid, the subject of a great deal of discussion, and even have had entire college courses and documentaries created around themBut secondly, and more importantly, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with asking questions you don’t know the answers to. It’s not stupid to wonder about the things that make you curious — it’s just a sign that you want to learn. Whether or not the question is valid, I think it’s terrifying that people are so quick to jump on a sign of wanting to know more as a negative. How else do we learn?Why Do We Hate Teen Girls So Much?The flavor of hate Gracie Cunningham, accidental TikTok star, got was a very specific breed: the kind we display for One Direction fans, for Twilight stans, for pumpkin latte drinkers. The kind that only rears its head when a young woman expresses her opinions. I remember when I was a kid in school, I had a visceral fear of showing I liked “girly” things — pink, sparkles, selfies. Anything that was tied to female teendom was uncool. Likewise, the patterns of speech favored by young women are, typically just by association, deemed lesser. People who say “like” a lot are seen as more unintelligent, for example.“I’m imagining a very memorable dialect that I’m sure we’re all familiar with, oftentimes (and, perhaps, erroneously) associated with caucasian females who enjoy the taste of pumpkin-flavored coffee,” says Roland Kratt, on the subject of if saying “like” too much is a sign of lesser intelligence.The research backs me up: Women’s thoughts and contributions are more likely to be scorned, even when they’re just as valid as their male counterparts’.Gracie’s video encapsulates everything that’s wrong about how we view teen girls. She asked valid questions, that actual philosophy professors don’t have answers for, that entire movies have been created about. But her questions weren’t seen as deep or worthy of consideration. She was just a dumb teenage girl, putting on makeup and asking foolish questions.Ultimately, Gracie, aka Math Girl, had her comeuppance: She went viral (and her second video went viral, too) with most people in her corner. Despite the fact that the comment that rocketed her to temporary stardom was that the video was “the dumbest ever,” people got over the fact that she was a young girl on the internet.It showcases two problems, in my opinion. First, to be young and female and doing just about anything, whether it’s enjoying music, a book, a drink, or asking questions about things we don’t understand, is nearly universally hated. People think it’s OK to pile on horrible comments online for the slightest cause, and Gracie’s video is an example of that. What could these trolls gain by crapping on her and her ideas? What did they benefit? Nothing other than minimizing the opinion of a young woman.Secondly, it really underlines the problem we, as a society, have with the problem of perception. As soon as you ask a question, it’s a weakness to be exploited or mocked, instead of a totally valid way to express curiosity and potentially learn something new.It doesn’t have to be too deep — it was a one-minute TikTok video where a girl pontificated on the origins of math. I don’t think she wanted to be hailed as a mathematical and philosophical genius.But I’m glad Gracie is the internet’s new hero, and I’m glad she’s asking questions about math. It actually inspired me to do some reading on the topic, and as a result, I know more about Pythagoras’ theorem and the leading hypotheses on what causes the origin of math as we know it. I’ve come out on top, and hopefully, so has our viral TikTok Math Girl. I’m glad there was such a backlash to the original reception. And I hope more girls and women take this as encouragement to speak their own minds, too. The way we treat women online, mocking them for their interests or thoughts, has got to stop.Written byZulie RaneFull-time writer & cat mom.

We jumped directly to EP:04 — DIGITS as it was suggested by a friend. It’s about the numerical probability which can be applied to almost anything, CRAZY right.Let me give a quick gist on BENFORD’s law; What exactly it is:It is the frequency of numbers in any category is not evenly distributed. Ex: Number begins with digit-1 will be approx. 30% and 9 will be less than 5%. This series has explanation on various fields applying this theory and it is right.Check 👉🏼wiki for more information.Fake records, fraudulent cases,tax cheats, can be identified easily with this law — If the number doesn’t fit in the chart, there is a high probability that it is FAKE. OMG!!!My Mind right now 🤔, so if you are un-following or following or quitting/joining social media, is it because we are all connected, and the universe have to maintain the balance, so it gets adjusted in the BENFORD’s LAW. And we are signing in social media account because someone has left, maybe we are filling the gap.DON’T TELLL MEEEE!!!!!! 😱 This curiosity lead me to an EXPERIMENT. (The episode already shows how a women did a study on twitter data).So I tried this for one of my social media accounts- @crafttistory which I have started newly for sharing my Art & Crafts ideas and learning.I took the follower count as input. Look at the below chart, it has exactly around 30% of digit-1 and 20 % of digit -2.Benford’s LawMy reaction after seeing this — stunned, flabbergasted, muddled.ARE WE ALL CONNECTED???Written byBhamila Authithan""Live your life as if it is last day"" aka Fiona | Artist | Dancer | Software Engineer | Sports person | Travelaholic | Explorer |AmbivertFollow1 1 1 ScienceBenfords LawNetflixUniverseMathematicsMore from Bhamila AuthithanFollow""Live your life as if it is last day"" aka Fiona | Artist | Dancer | Software Engineer | Sports person | Travelaholic | Explorer |AmbivertMore From MediumWhy we urgently need to adapt democracy to changing timesEnrique Dans in Enrique DansSocial Media — An Invitation to AdventureJoseph Anderson in The StartupMemes and VirusesYohanes Theda in The StartupIs Canceling Even Worth It Anymore?Kristin Merrilees in The StartupConfessions Of A Teenage Tech AddictSarvasv Kulpati in Confessions Of A Teenage Tech AddictWhy Instagram Makes You, Me and Selena Gomez Feel BadKate Imbach in VantageThe Twitter ReckoningChristopher Pierznik in The Passion of Christopher PierznikFacebook to block ads on election day; but it won’t make a differencePolina Kroik in Digital DiplomacyAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Confronting the fear of Calculus,https://medium.com/@balajiv1909/confronting-the-fear-of-calculus-357316927a96?source=tag_archive---------9-----------------------,"Mathematics,Calculus,Engineering,Education,Science","Apart from exams, what terrifies students the most?The answer is mathematics in general and calculus in particular. There is hardly any topic that gets the wrath of students as much as calculus.Is the fear justified? Or is poor calculus just being accused wrongly? That, precisely is the point of this article. If you love playing with integrals and differential equations, congratulations! Newton and Leibniz are proud of you. Or, if you are one of those who think, “why I am doing all this?” every time you face calculus, then do read ahead.On the rudimentary level, Calculus is a branch of mathematics that studies change. It is also called ‘maths of change’. Hence, calculus finds its application in places where there is a change involved. Growth of bacteria in a sample, decline of coronavirus cases, speed of rocket as its fuel level decreases, you name it. Wherever there is a change, there is calculus.Unlike other branches of mathematics, calculus was born out of need. It was developed to analyse continuous physical phenomenon by discretizing into tiny (infinitesimal) parts. After his university was closed due to the plague, Newton developed and described the formal methods of calculus in his book Principia. Although Newton is credited with establishing the formal systems of calculus, its basic ideas were developed over the years by many great mathematicians. There is still a controversy whether it was Newton or Leibniz who first published his ideas on infinitesimal calculus, but let’s not get into that (this is a blog, not India TV)Techniques of calculus are used in wide variety of fields, especially in engineering and science. So, why has calculus been ostracized, cursed and hated by so many students? The reason has partly to do with the archaic Greeco-Latin symbols used for its representation.Photo by JESHOOTS.COM on UnsplashWith such a form, calculus makes for a bad first impression in students’ minds. It is the fatigue of seeing pages and pages of these obscure symbols that pushes people away from calculus. The symbols get weirder and weirder the more one progresses through single variate, integral, multivariate and vector calculus.Popular media has also stigmatized calculus. In movies or TV the brainy characters are often portrayed working with blackboards full of calculus symbols. Thus, when students are introduced to it for the first time, they are strongly prejudiced that this is rocket science and can’t be comprehended by mere mortals. (Interestingly, calculus is used in rocket science too!)For some students, not just calculus but mathematics as a whole is terrifying. Such notions stem from past prejudices and popular opinion. As a result students who were fascinated by science suddenly back out from studying it in higher secondary level as soon as they realize it involves a whole lot of math.In a sharp blow to our education system, students avoid or skip calculus, (or any other complex math for that matter) even in a math heavy field like engineering. Ironic, isn’t it? Majority of the students bypass the governing equations and focus only on the generated results. The curriculum and testing too doesn’t emphasize on applications derived from elementary equations and limits itself to certain pre-set ‘situations’ which can be tackled by memorizing the appropriate formula for the right situation. The result? Exercises in critical thinking and formulation of physical problems are reduced to mere mugging and plugging; Mugging up of formulae and plugging in appropriate numbers. This is not engineering, its arithmetic!For example, the Navier-Stokes equations are the backbone of fluid mechanics. These set of partial differential equations describe fluid flow. Any undergraduate course in fluid mechanics is incomplete without a thorough analysis of these equations. But, ask any engineer if he/she can remember, what the equations are or what they represent and you will get blank faces, awkward stares and possibly a change of topic. The TdS equations and Maxwell’s relations in thermodynamics, Heat conduction Partial differential equation and boundary layer theory are some examples of calculus based concepts which are generally ignored by students because they are complex, incomprehensible or outright boring. It’s only while studying abroad that they realize its significance and study hard to make up for lost ground that could have been covered in undergraduate level itself.All this staying away and avoiding (ghosting, as the millennials would prefer) has defeated the purpose with which those concepts were envisioned. The sole purpose of developing complex mathematical ideas (and the associated symbolism) was to simplify the study of natural phenomena. In essence, calculus or advanced math should make life easier, not difficult. Hence, they are to be embraced and applied, not feared of and run from. Proper understanding and subsequent application is the key to get going with calculus.Inspite of realizing the power of math, there will always be people who don’t like or are hesitant to learn such advanced topics. It’s not a bad thing though, as they will pay hefty salaries to scientists and engineers to do the heavy number crunching for them. A win-win situation. My advice to fellow engineers: Don’t avoid calculus, it is not something to be afraid of. Instead embrace it, you will discover newer ways to analyse real world problems and who knows, may even lead to a discovery. Newton’s example has shown that pandemics are after all an excellent time to make new breakthroughs in math, science and technology.Written byBalaji VEngineering Student⚙️ | Budding Writer✒️Follow1 1 1 MathematicsCalculusEngineeringEducationScienceMore from Balaji VFollowEngineering Student⚙️ | Budding Writer✒️More From MediumAVL Trees for the Win!Betsy BaileyDating GamesElias Fong in The StartupThe “Unreal” Math Of Chasing A BusJulia Fisher in The StartupGo is Pspace-hard | An analysisKendra SwansonBreaking Down the Massive 4-Team NBA Blockbuster TradeBrandon Anderson in SportsRaidThe birthday problem — An excursion into probabilitySri Balaji Gopinath in The StartupLinear Algebra 101 — Part 4Sho Nakagome in sho.jpOn Bernoulli NumbersMahesh Reddy in Cantor’s ParadiseAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
"<strong class=""cc"">Logic is a Disabling Tool</strong>",https://medium.com/illumination-curated/logic-is-a-disabling-tool-not-an-enabling-science-or-knowledge-5168a1cad514?source=tag_archive---------10-----------------------,"Philosophy,Philosophy Of Science,Mathematics,Logic,Truth","There is no evidence that logic supplies anything useful to our ability of reasoning.Image by Gerd Altmann from PixabayPreliminary Comments‘What is’ must be answered by us all for how it is being. A fact is what is. But how a fact is being can only be expressed as our interpretation or opinion. Science or knowledge should be based on the most realistic opinion of what It is that constitutes the ultimate Truth which is at the basis of our search for science or knowledge. Consequently, science is only science (knowledge is only knowledge) if it is based on a scientist’s realization of the ultimate Truth and is not just based on a pseudo-scientist’s imagined or fantasized ‘ultimate Truth’.The imagined or fantasized ‘ultimate Truth’ of traditional and modern pseudo-scientists as well as traditional and modern pseudo-philosophers is determinism. Determinism is the philosophical doctrine that we are not free to determine our choices, but that our ‘choices’ are all determined for us. According to a secular determinist, our choices are not predetermined for us. But, according to a religious determinist, all our choices are pre-determined for us, with the exception of our choice to accept our destiny by supposedly following the Creator’s Divine Plan for us or reject our destiny so that we are fated to perish by Creator’s ‘Divine’ Plan.Aristotle’s Philosophical FallacyTo promote his deterministic philosophy, Aristotle invented his disabling tool or ‘organon’ of logic. Aristotle believed logic was to be used to delineate the happenings which he supposed were deterministically or inevitably sequenced to occur as the ‘divine intellect’ or ‘unmoved mover’ of Nature had supposedly orchestrated these happenings to occur. In philosophy, such a sequence of inevitable happenings is known as ‘the slippery slope fallacy’ because there are no inevitable sequence of happenings. There are no inevitable sequence of happenings because either God uses Its Will, unintentionally, or we use God’s Will in tandem with God, unintentionally or intentionally, to intervene in a sequence of happenings so that the happenings in the sequence are changed.Photo by K. Mitch Hodge on UnsplashBecause of the slippery slope fallacy, it should be obvious to philosophers that mathematics is a highly suspect discipline and is not a science or knowledge because the logical equations and formulas of mathematics imply that the Universe is set upon an inevitable sequence of happenings. This is also why the search of theoretical physicists for the mathematical Theory of Everything (TOE) is doomed to failure because the Universe is not lawfully ordered in a logical sequence of happenings which must inevitably unfold. Despite the usefulness of applied mathematics, the mathematics of geometry, algebra, calculus, and statistics are idealities; therefore, even applied mathematics does not refer to realities as these realities actually are.Logic is not a Science, but is a Disabling ToolIronically, even Aristotle, who invented his disabling tool of logic, realized that logic was not a science, but was a tool for deluded investigators to use so that they could assert their philosophy that we are deterministically destined or fated. Of course, Aristotle did not think that either he or other investigators who were using logic were deluded. Aristotle did not realize that he was deluded because he did not realize that his belief in law and order, which was the basis of his logic, was delusional. Consequently, he did not realize that his belief in logic had to be delusional, too.The Delusional Basis of LogicThe word, ‘law’, as well as the word, ‘order’, are only nominal because these words have no real referents; therefore, the word, ‘logic’, is also only nominal because logic is the fantasized establishment of a set of laws for reasoning. We don’t need to use such a fantasized set of laws to govern our reasoning. This is obvious because we don’t use logos or reason to apply our disfaculty of intellect, cogitation, or logic to our reasoning; we use our disability of intellectualizing, cogitating, or ‘logicizing’ (a word coined by me) to apply our disfaculty of intellect, cogitation, or logic to our reasoning ability.There are no laws in Nature; there are only needs in God and us by which we are motivated to organize, not order, the natural phenomena of Heaven and the Universe. Neither God nor we have an ability to order natural phenomena because there are no laws which we could use to order these phenomena. Phenomena cannot be ordered by laws; phenomena can only be organized by God’s unintentional use of the branches of Its Will in these phenomena or by our unintentional or intentional use of the branches of God’s Will in tandem with God which exists in us and our phenomenal body so that we can organize the processes of our phenomenal body or let God organize this processing without our intervention.For example, we can intentionally organize the process of our breathing according to our needs by using the branches of God’s Will in tandem with God or we can intentionally or unintentionally let God use Its branches of Will to organize the process that is our breathing without our intervention because God has a need to strive for a wisdom which It can never fulfil. As a result, God’s need to strive for wisdom is Its motivation for maintaining the noumenal activities (the gods) whom It develops, the processes of all the physical phenomena composing the Universe which It evolves and grows, as well as the processes of all the energetical phenomena existing in the Phenomenon we call ‘Nature’ or ‘Energy’ which It also evolves and grows.Photo by Roman Mager on UnsplashBefore Aristotle invented his disabling tool of logic, natural pseudo-philosophers, like the Presocratics, and most pseudo-religionists, like the religious fanatics who opposed the sane religionists, only indulged in intellectualizing or cogitating without realizing that their intellectualizing or cogitating could also be referred to as ‘logicizing’. Despite his invention of logic, Aristotle did not realize that logicizing existed any more than his ancestors did because he did not know that logic did not come directly from logos or reason. Aristotle intellectualized, cogitated, or logicized that reasoning was logical, rather than that reasoning was reasonable; therefore, Aristotle did not realize that only the disability of logicizing existed, not the supposed ‘ability’ of logical reasoning, because Aristotle did not realize that phrase ‘logical reasoning’ is a contradiction in terms (an oxymoron).The natural pseudo-philosophers and the pseudo-religionists who existed before Aristotle’s era were unconsciously using logic as a tool to logicize (intellectualize). In other words, they were unconscious logicians. Aristotle consciously used logic which meant that he was a conscious logician; however he was unconscious of the fact that he was logicizing. Almost everyone in our modern world is unconscious of the fact that they are logicizing because they have swallowed Aristotle’s delusional belief in logic as a wholistic hypothesis without first digesting whether it merits our use of it.For example, our modern secular pseudo-scientists logicize according to their belief that the laws of Nature not only determine the processes of the world, but also determine our fate by the principle or law of automatism, while the pseudo-religionists of the world logicize according to their belief that the Creator creates laws by which to use his Will to create everything and everyone from Nothingness or Non-Existence. Ironically, secular pseudo-scientists and devout pseudo-religionists do not realize that there is no reasonable means by which laws could be used to activate anything.Pseudo-religionists do not realize that that the word, ‘Nothingness’, and its synonym, ‘Non-Existence’, do not have a real referent, while the word, ‘Space’ and Its synonym, ‘Existence’, have a real referent. The real referent of Space or Existence is the unbounded extent of Existing No-thingness (Existing Essence) which we call ‘God’. Pseudo-religionists do not realize that No-thingness is not Nothingness because they fail to understand that No-thingness Exists, while Nothingness fails to Exist which means that Nothingness only exists as a word in our imaginations and has no reality in absolute Reality. And because the Creator’s supposed ability to create is the ability to bring something into Existence from Nothingness, the ability to create is a delusional belief; therefore, the Creator is also a delusional belief.Aristotle used laws in a delusional attempt to control his reasoning. He failed to understand that we can only guide our way of being in absolute Reality, not control our way of being in It. As a result of his delusion, Aristotle cogitated the hypothesis that his logic was the controlling authority of his reasoning which could only mean that he cogitated he was controlled by the ‘divine intellect’ which he called ‘the unmoved mover’. Aristotle failed to realize that logos or reason only gives rise to the intelligent ability of reasoning, while the intellect, cogitation, or logic that we mistakenly invent with our logos or reason gives rise to our stupid disability of intellectualizing, cogitating, or logicizing.My Discovery of the Ultimate TruthAristotle also failed to realize that love was the divineness of the Divinity, not the disfaculty of intellect. Although the Divinity has the faculty of intelligence in which It uses Its Will to strive for wisdom, It cannot use the ability to intelligize in Its intelligence because It does not have this ability; therefore, It can never develop wisdom.But neither the Divinity nor the Divinity’s love are the ultimate Truth. And, of course, the philosophy of determinism does not express the ultimate Truth because the fantasized ‘ultimate Truth’ of determinism is absolute control.Photo by Christopher Laberinto on UnsplashI have discovered that the philosophy of libertarianism is best symbolized by the dolphin, rather than the Statue of Liberty, because the ultimate Truth is the freedom or liberty with which God expresses Its use of Will and with which we express our use of God’s Will in tandem with God. Freedom is the ultimate Truth because we must be at liberty to express our emotions, thoughtfully, reasonably, and responsibly, according to our own needs and sane or benevolent desires so that we enjoy our experiences, while we must also be at liberty to express our emotions, thoughtlessly, unreasonably, and irresponsibly, according to our insane or malevolent desires so that we experience suffering. Only by experiencing the consequences of our irresponsibility do we learn to be libertarians, rather than libertines.God is absolutely free because God’s actions cannot be restrained. God obviously has no wisdom in Its absolute freedom to act because a wise God would not use Its Will in Its infinite Universe to activate natural catastrophes which result in a god’s sensing of pains in her or his body, feeling of emotional hurts in her or his large uncondensed energy form, and intuiting of conflicts in her or his intelligence, mind, and ego.We have a need to freely reason, but we also experience the insane desire to determine our reasoning by applying logic to it so that it turns into logicizing, rather than remains reasoning. We also have a need to habilitate or enable our ability to improvisationally reason by improvisationally reasoning in relation to any reasoning which we have completed to ascertain whether we have committed any philosophical fallacies in our original reasoning. We do not need to ‘logically justify’ our claims with ‘critical thinking’; we only need to habilitate our claims with an improvisationally reasoned examination of our claim.We don’t have a need to criticize and justify our claims; we only have a need to analyze and examine our claims so that we are comfortable that our claim is not mistaken. There is no need to justify your claim to anyone, just as there is no need to justify your life to God, because God has no ability to know that you even exist. You see, even though God developed you, God has no ability to consciously know that It has developed you, anyone else, or anything.The Implications of My Ultimate Truth for the Organization of SocietyOur institutions of justice base their laws on either the authority of our pseudo-scientists’, who suppose that the Universe operates, automatically, according to laws which have supposedly always existed, or the authority of Creationists, whose doctrine of Creationism maintains that the Universe was created by the Creator who supposedly used and uses laws by which to govern his use of his Will to operate the Universe. Thus, our institutions of justice are not based on libertarianism; rather, they are based on determinism, despite all the hype of democratic countries that their countries are based on freedom.The opinion of the ‘authorities’ in our institutions of justice do not accord with my ultimate Truth of freedom because their interpretation of ‘what is’ (the facts) is based on their fear of taking accountability for how their belief in logic has interfered with their ability to reason. They do not want to give up their belief in authority because they do not understand how to cooperate, reasonably. This is why our justice systems develop criminals, rather than habilitate people so that they experience wellness.Even our institutions of habilitation are compromised because they exist in a society ruled by institutions of justice. When we learn to develop a society where there are no competitive authorities utilizing a statute of laws which they use to vengefully and unaccountably restrain us all, we will realize that we only need competitive cooperators using a structure of needs to free the accountable, while restraining or confining the unaccountable — without an attitude of vengeance. Then, we will all be free to express our emoting, thoughtfully, reasonably, and accountably, because everyone will realize that when we want to be condescending competitive authorities, rather than expert competitive cooperators, we will tend to express our emoting, thoughtlessly, unreasonably, and unaccountably.A free and sane society cannot be an authoritative communism any more than it can be an authoritative democracy. A free and sane society can only be a competitive cooperative in which there is a hierarchy of competitive cooperation, not a hierarchy of competitive authority. Such a competitive cooperative would be an anarchistic cooperative with a competitively cooperating administration, not a government with a competitively governing administration. There would be levels of accountability in such an anarchic competitive cooperative with the Prime Competitive Cooperator assuming the highest level of accountability. The Prime Competitive Cooperator would have the accountability of coordinating the administration responsible for keeping this competitive cooperative free and sane. Neither the Prime Competitive Cooperator nor any other citizens in the competitive cooperative’s administration would be politically motivated; rather, they would all be apolitically motivated, because politics are only necessary in an authoritative hierarchy.Although my ultimate Truth of freedom is only my opinion or bias, those of you who understand that to be reasonable is not to be logical and to be unreasonable is not to be illogical should realize why I am certain that my ultimate Truth of freedom really is the ultimate Truth, despite the success of logicians’ who have indoctrinated the intelligence of the unwary with their propaganda so that we only intellectually logicize, rather than intelligently reason.ILLUMINATION-CuratedILLUMINATION-Curated hosts outstanding stories of advanced writers covering 100+ topics.FollowPhilosophyPhilosophy Of ScienceMathematicsLogicTruthWritten byDaryl MowatFollowI write about philosophical subjects related to my profession of kinesiology.

Bayes’ Theorem,https://medium.com/@toprak.mhmt/bayes-theorem-89daf9f11769?source=tag_archive---------11-----------------------,"Bayes Theorem,Mathematics,Statistics,Data Science","Bayes theorem is an indispensable law of probability, allowing you to deductively quantify unknown probabilities. The theory rests upon conditional probability. Let’s take a look at it in practice.Breaking the formula apartBayes’ theorem is quite intuitive, decomposing the conditional probability of ‘A given B’ in terms of the probability that both events are true divided by the probability that B is true. Bayes theorem takes this natural idea a step further, expressing the probability that both events are true as a conditional probability multiplied by the condition itself.To recap:Bayes’ Theorem takes the definition of the conditional likelihood:and rewrites the 𝑃(𝐴∩𝐵)P(A∩B) as 𝑃(𝐵|𝐴)𝑃(𝐴)P(B|A)P(A), which makes perfect sense; the probability of B given A is true, multiplied by the probability that A is true, gives us the probability that both are true.Making this substitution, you have Bayes’ Theorem:A simple exampleLet’s take a simple theoretical example to demonstrate. Imagine there are two fish tanks at the local pet store. The small tank holds 10 Betta fish. The large tank has 200 goldfish and 35 Betta fish. Given that a fish is a Betta fish, what’s the probability it comes from the small tank?On the one hand, it seems that if you were to select a fish from the large tank, you’d probably end up with a goldfish. However, because these tanks are of such vastly different sizes, the probability that the fish came from the larger tank is actually more probable.Using Bayes’ theorem, you are looking to find the probability that the fish came from the small tank, given that it is a Betta fish:While concrete, this example fails to demonstrate the full power of Bayes’ theorem since you had all of the underlying information, so you don’t even need to use Bayes’ theorem. You could have simply looked at the number of Betta fish in the small tank versus the number of Betta fish overall: 10/45 giving you exactly the same result.An NLP exampleWith this simple example out of the way, let’s examine a more practical example from the field of Natural Language Processing.A common introductory example to Natural Language Processing or classification is detecting spam. While you may enjoy spam in a can, you probably don’t enjoy getting spam in your inbox. Bayes’ theorem can serve as a natural classification method in these scenarios. Assume that the word “offer” (as in Special Offer, We Have an Offer for You, or Don’t Miss This Offer!) occurs in 73% of the spam messages you receive. In comparison, only 10% of your desired mail contains the word “offer”. If 20% of the messages you receive are spam, and you receive another message with the word “offer”, what is the probability that it is spam?As you might have guessed, you can solve this using the Bayes’ theorem!First, set up the problem:As you can see, while spam has a much higher occurrence of the word “offer”, the presence of the word alone does not provide strong confidence that the message is spam. To provide more statistical power, you will eventually extend Bayes’ theorem to multiple observations simultaneously using the relative probabilities of multiple words.In this blog, you were introduced to the Bayes’ theorem, and saw how it can be used to quantify conditional probabilities.Written byMehmet ToprakData Scientist | Machine Learning Engineer | Data EngineerFollow49 49 49 Bayes TheoremMathematicsStatisticsData ScienceMore from Mehmet ToprakFollowData Scientist | Machine Learning Engineer | Data EngineerMore From MediumThe Next Step in Computer Vision: Convolutional Neural NetworksKarthik Mittal in The StartupHow I Learn Quantum ComputingChristophe Pere in The StartupWhat got published in 2019 in Healthcare ML research?Santosh Shevade in Data Driven InvestorMathematics Behind Logistic RegressionVinithavn in Analytics VidhyaUnderstanding Pascal VOC and COCO Annotations for Object DetectionPushkar Pushp in Towards AINatural Language ProcessingAshish PandeyProductionizing Machine Learning ModelsCharu Makhijani in The StartupDeep Learning-based Text Detection and Recognition In Research LabPriyank Jain in Connected Lab TechBlogAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
What is the height of the Table?,https://medium.com/dev-genius/what-is-the-height-of-the-table-75ce5cdd11a3?source=tag_archive---------12-----------------------,"Math Riddle,Puzzle,Math,Mathematics","hii friends this is Pritam here.Here is the question, that in both cases there are a cat and a rat but in the first case, this height is 34 cm, and in 2nd case, the height is 26 cm.now we have to find the height of the table.…………………………solution…………………………….Let the height of the cat is c cm and the height of that rat is r cm. and the height of this part is x cm and y cm for this part.From the 1sr case, the height of the table T will be x+r.And from 2nd case, the height of the table is c+y.Form the 1st case if you try to write the equation then it will be C+X=34 and for the 2nd case it will be R+Y= 26,Adding these two equations we get C+X+R+Y=34+26It implies C+Y+X+R=60Which is equal to T+T=60 as we already know the height of the table.Therefore 2T=60It means T=30Therefore the height of the table is 30 cm.You can see how easy the solution was; we just have added these two equations and have got the height of the table.so that’s it for today guys if you like this story then like it.

The Viral Math Girl From TikTok Perfectly Encapsulates What It’s Like to Be Female Online,https://medium.com/better-marketing/the-viral-math-girl-from-tiktok-perfectly-encapsulates-what-its-like-to-be-female-online-f5bebbfb08a9?source=tag_archive---------13-----------------------,"Culture,Digital Culture,Equality,Social Media,Mathematics","Source: TikTokI was browsing Twitter, as I try to avoid doing too much these days, and I came across a viral video (12.1 million views) shared by @aleturner, saying it was the dumbest one she’d ever seen.I was intrigued. In it, a young blond woman applied makeup for work while discoursing freely on how the concept of mathematics came to be. She asked questions like, “who came up with this concept?” and “how would you start on the concept of algebra?”The initial reaction was one of mockery. People were quick to dismiss her and call her and her video “dumb.” Simply because she was young, blonde, and said “like” and “stuff” a lot, commentators determined that her questions were invalid and that the education system should have done a better job of explaining math to her.First of all, the questions she was asking were actually very good. Philosopher and math college professors themselves have said that her questions were valid, the subject of a great deal of discussion, and even have had entire college courses and documentaries created around themBut secondly, and more importantly, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with asking questions you don’t know the answers to. It’s not stupid to wonder about the things that make you curious — it’s just a sign that you want to learn.

The Viral Math Girl From TikTok Perfectly Encapsulates What It’s Like to Be Female Online,https://medium.com/better-marketing/the-viral-math-girl-from-tiktok-perfectly-encapsulates-what-its-like-to-be-female-online-f5bebbfb08a9?source=tag_archive---------14-----------------------,"Culture,Digital Culture,Equality,Social Media,Mathematics","Source: TikTokI was browsing Twitter, as I try to avoid doing too much these days, and I came across a viral video (12.1 million views) shared by @aleturner, saying it was the dumbest one she’d ever seen.I was intrigued. In it, a young blond woman applied makeup for work while discoursing freely on how the concept of mathematics came to be. She asked questions like, “who came up with this concept?” and “how would you start on the concept of algebra?”The initial reaction was one of mockery. People were quick to dismiss her and call her and her video “dumb.” Simply because she was young, blonde, and said “like” and “stuff” a lot, commentators determined that her questions were invalid and that the education system should have done a better job of explaining math to her.First of all, the questions she was asking were actually very good. Philosopher and math college professors themselves have said that her questions were valid, the subject of a great deal of discussion, and even have had entire college courses and documentaries created around themBut secondly, and more importantly, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with asking questions you don’t know the answers to. It’s not stupid to wonder about the things that make you curious — it’s just a sign that you want to learn.

A Comprehensible Introduction To Mathematical Induction,https://medium.com/cantors-paradise/a-comprehensible-introduction-to-mathematical-induction-aef1a61eedcf?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Mathematics,Math,Education,Science,Philosophy","Math can actually be easy! Most of the time, the real problem is not that students aren’t smart enough, but that mathematical topics are taught in highly confusing ways. I have done a lot of math tutoring, and at some point I realized that once students see the bigger picture, things tend to fall into place almost automatically. So that’s how we’ll do it. Bigger picture first, math second, and hopefully some fun along the way. Once we get to the second part, the math will most likely no longer scare you. As for previous knowledge, it is only assumed that you know how to transform basic terms and equations. Alright, let’s get started then.The stunning discovery of Carl Friedrich GaussCarl Friedrich Gauss was a German mathematician and is widely regarded as one of the smartest and most influential mathematicians of all time. Born in 1777, he went to school at a time when students had to get by without calculators and other fancy stuff. There wasn’t much more than blackboards and chalk. The story goes that his teacher wanted to have some off-time and was looking for a way to keep his students busy for a while. So he told them to add up all natural numbers from 1 all the way up to 100. Back then, you could still get caned if you screwed up, so the teacher expected that his students would be busy for quite some time, giving him a chance to basically take a nap. After all, they had to carefully calculate the result of this simple yet cumbersome term by hand:1 + 2 + 3 … + 98 + 99 + 100That’s a whopping 99 additions. While the first ones are still easy, the difficulty keeps going up as the numbers keep getting larger. Your chances of not screwing up are quite low since it only takes one miscalculation out of 99 to get a wrong result. While everybody else started to do one calculation after another, Gauss just sat there for a few minutes and thought about the problem at hand. Then he simply wrote down the correct solution:5050Yes, that’s right. The correct solution is 5050, and Gauss simply wrote it down on his blackboard. He was the only one who came up with the correct answer. While his teacher initially thought he might have to give Gauss a thorough beating for being lazy, he eventually had to admit that Gauss was right. At this time Gauss may have been just six or seven years old. Well, the dude was a genius after all. Alright then, how exactly did he manage to do 99 additions in just a few minutes without writing down anything? Well, he actually didn’t.What Gauss really did was to recognize a simple pattern. He saw that the sum of the first and the last number equals 101. So does the sum of the second and second-last number. The same applies to the third and the third-last number. I guess by now you’re getting the picture.1 + 100 = 1012 + 99 = 1013 + 98 = 101..49 + 52 = 10150 + 51 = 101Once you see this pattern, the solution is quite simple. Since we have 100 numbers in total and we need two of them for each equation, we end up with a grand total of 50 equations, right?100 / 2 = 50Now we simply have 101 times 50 which, big surprise, is the result that little Gauss wrote down.101 * 50 = 5050Great, now we have learned about how smart Gauss already was at quite an early age. The story is certainly a nice one, but how on earth will it help us learn about mathematical induction? Don’t worry, we’ll get there soon.A slightly more abstract way to look at what Gauss discoveredMathematicians are a strange bunch of people. They are never happy nor satisfied, they always want to know more and more. So instead of going all nuts and bananas about having found such an amazing shortcut to add up all the natural numbers from 1 to 100, they tend to immediately ask the next question. They would really love to know if this only works for an upper limit of 100, or if we can use the very same approach for any upper limit of our choice. Mathematicians want to know if there’s a formula where we can simply put in the upper limit and then get the sum of all the natural numbers all the way up to the upper limit we chose.What mathematicians do in order to accomplish this is to substitute the upper limit of our specific case, right here that would be 100, with a letter. In math we call such a letter a variable. In our case, it stands for any natural number of our choice. Let’s pick “n” to represent this variable. Any other letter would work just the same. In fact, we could also use emojis instead of letters, it absolutely wouldn’t matter.Let’s take one more look at the final equation for adding up all natural numbers from 1 to 100.101 * 50 = 5050Our upper limit is 100 and we would now like to be able to pick any natural number for the upper limit, not just 100. What we need to do is to substitute 100 with our variable, but let’s first write the equation in a slightly different way. On the left side we will express both numbers, 101 and 50, by using our upper limit of 100.( 100 + 1 ) * ( 100 / 2 ) = 5050Now we can easily substitute 100 with the variable “n”.( n + 1 ) * ( n / 2 ) = “The sum of all natural number from 1 to n”Great job! Now we have a formula where we can simply pick any upper limit we want, substitute the variable “n” with this limit of our choice, and then we get the sum by simply calculating the result of the term! That’s one heck of an accomplishment. Let’s say somebody picked 1,000,000,000 as the upper limit. Calculating the sum by hand would take forever and not screwing up along the way would be virtually impossible. With our newly discovered formula, the necessary calculations always remain constant. One addition, one division and one multiplication, that’s all it will take no matter what upper limit we pick! Could be 10, could be 1,000,000. It doesn’t matter.Alright, let’s give it a try then. Let’s pick an upper limit of 4.1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10Now let’s use our cool formula instead.( 4 + 1 ) * ( 4 / 2 ) = 5 * 2 = 10Amazing, this really seems to work! One more try with an upper limit of 7.1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28( 7 + 1 ) * ( 7 / 2 ) = 8 * 3.5 = 28Great, this works as well! You may now go ahead and try some more upper limits if you want to. Chances are they’ll work just the same.Why we need some sort of proof techniqueMathematicians would now keep playing with this formula for a while. They want to see if they can find an example that doesn’t work. After many hours of playing around and not finding a single example that didn’t work, they come up with the educated guess that this formula works for any natural number we can possibly pick for “n”. Often times, 0 is also considered a natural number. This is the one upper limit we should rule out, because adding all natural numbers from 1 to 0 makes little sense. Picking 1 as the upper limit would be ok. We would only have one natural number and we actually need two of them to perform an addition, but simply using 0 as the second number will do the trick since adding 0 doesn’t change the final result.1 + 0 = 1Using the formula yields the same result.( 1 + 1 ) * ( 1 / 2 ) = 2 * 0.5 = 1So we are safe if we just rule out 0 as the upper limit. Alright, now here comes the part where we’ll eventually get to mathematical induction. The problem is that an educated guess isn’t going to cut it! It’s simply not how math works. Our intuition may tell us this formula should always work, but mathematics is about delivering hard proof. That’s a very important point. Mathematicians want to prove that the formula always works. That’s the beauty of mathematics. Every formula, every theorem has to be proven. Hard evidence is the very essence of math. Alright then, now on to the hard(er) part, let’s do some mathematical induction.Mathematical induction to the rescue!A formula such as ours is basically a statement about natural numbers. It tells us how to use a fancy shortcut in order to quickly get the sum of all natural numbers all the way up to an upper limit of our choice. When mathematicians first started trying to prove such formulas, they simply couldn’t quite figure out how to do it. Explicitly proving the formula for an upper limit of 1, then 2, then 3 and so on doesn’t get you anywhere. There is an infinite amount of natural numbers, so you can never say your job is done. What we need is some kind of trick, some insight that will help us reach our goal. Just like little Gauss found a hidden pattern and came up with his famous 5050, we now also need to find something that will get us far. Trying to figure out this trick all by yourself is almost impossible. I sure know I would never have found it on my own. Good thing is that’s not the goal. We’ll be perfectly fine with just comprehending what others have already discovered.Ok, let’s take a look at the small trick that’s called mathematical induction. It’s a lot like dominoes. We all have seen a long line of dominoes. Tipping over the very first one triggers a chain reaction, and all the other dominoes will drop one by one. What we have to do when performing the miracle of mathematical induction is to explicitly topple over the first domino of our chain, and then we need to show that this will cause all other dominoes to drop as well. As for the bigger picture, that’s absolutely all there is to know! Really, it is that simple.So let’s start doing some serious math then. Now that you know what we want to accomplish, it won’t be all that hard to follow along. Things simply tend to make a lot more sense once you know why they’re being done in the first place. First up is how to tip over the very first domino.Getting the first domino to fallGetting the first domino to fall is very simple. All it takes is to show that our formula works for the very first number it can be applied to. In our case, this is 1. Toppling over the first domino is called the base case in math. You might want to remember this term because chances are your teacher will ask you about it in a future test. Alright, that’s what the base case looks like.1 + 0 = 1( 1 + 1 ) * ( 1 / 2 ) = 2 * 0.5 = 1Thats all, base case done! What we have just shown is that our formula indeed works for the very first domino which happens to be 1. The first line explicitly calculates the sum from 1 to 1. Since we only have one number, but two numbers are needed in order to perform an addition, we simply choose 0 as the second number. The second line simply uses the formula we want to prove, but we substitute “n” with 1 and then show that the result of this term equals 1. The sum from 1 to 1 equals 1 and our formula gives us the same result. Great, now there is only one more thing left to do, and that’s the actual hard part. Well, not quite all that hard, but a bit harder than the base case.Showing that all the other dominoes will fall as wellShowing that toppling over the first one will eventually bring down all other dominoes as well is the tricky part, and we call it the induction step. It’s just another mathematical term for you to remember, but it’s not all that hard if you keep the domino picture in mind. Before I’ll show you the actual math behind the induction step, I’ll explain it to you without mathematical symbols. Again, math becomes way easier to follow along if you already know what all the equations are actually about.The one thing left to prove is that if the formula works for any arbitrary upper limit of our choice, then it also works for its successor. Going back to the dominoes, we simply want to show that if we already know that a certain domino has dropped, then the next one will drop as well. You haven’t seen the math for the induction step yet, but nonetheless you now already know how mathematical induction works. Really, that’s basically it! And if you happen to be halfway familiar with terms and equations, then the few lines of mathematical stuff at the very end won’t be much of a problem at all. It really isn’t all that much anyway.Alright, let’s just assume for a moment that we already did the math and we indeed managed to show that if our formula works for a certain upper limit, then the same formula also works for this upper limit’s successor. Let’s say somebody happens to come along and claims that for an upper limit of 4 our formula wouldn’t work. Of course, we could just use the formula directly and quickly prove the opposite. This would work just fine. However, the same person can now keep bothering us forever by always picking a new upper limit and challenging us to show that the formula works for it as well. Instead of using the formula over and over again, we can use our universally working proof instead.Now the line of argument goes as follows. Our formula would work for 4 if it worked for 3. We know this because the induction step proves that if it works for a certain number, then it also works for the next one. So if we knew it worked for 3, then we would also know it must work for 4, because 4 is the successor of 3. Now we simply continue in the same fashion. Our formula would work for 3 if it worked for 2. It would work for 2 if only it worked for 1. But wait, we already know it indeed does work for 1! Still remember our base case? There we explicitly delivered proof that our formula really works for 1. Great, now we can travel the road backwards. We now know it works for 1, so because of the induction step it also must work for the successor of 1 which happens to be 2. Now we know it works for 2, therefore it must work for 3 as well, and if it works for 3, then our formula also works for 4. Proof delivered, and not just for our arbitrary upper limit of 4. This line of argument obviously works for any upper limit we could possibly ever pick! We have shown that our formula works for all upper limits, except for 0 as mentioned earlier.Let’s do the missing little bit of mathAlright then, let’s do the actual math for the induction step to finish things up. We can simply assume that our formula already works for a certain upper limit, let’s call it “k”. We don’t want to use “n” again, because “n” is already used in the formula we want to prove. Let’s write S( k ) for the sum from 1 to k and S( k + 1 ) for the sum from 1 to k + 1. Introducing such abbreviations is very common in math and only serves the purpose of making equations shorter and therefore easier to read. We start out with the following simple equation.S( k +1 ) = S( k ) + ( k + 1 )This makes sense because it only says that the sum from 1 to k + 1 ist the same as the sum from 1 to k, with k + 1 added on top of it. Now let’s transform our original formula a little bit because it will make the rest of the proof somewhat simpler. Developing a feeling how to smartly transform terms and equations in order to get to a certain result quicker is a bit beyond the scope of this article, so I guess you just have to take my word for it.( n + 1 ) * ( n / 2 ) = n² / 2 + n / 2 = ( n² + n ) / 2Now, we can use our formula instead of S(k), because we assume that the formula already works for k.S( k+1 ) = ( k² + k ) / 2 + ( k+1 )Now we just transform the equation a bit. I won’t comment on the transformations, because this would make this article last forever and I initially assumed some basic knowledge about that stuff. I have to make some assumptions at some point, right? Anyhow, here we go.S( k+1 ) = ( k² + k ) / 2 + ( k+1 ) = ( k² + k + 2k +2 ) / 2= ( k² + 2k +1 + ( k +1 ) ) / 2= ( ( k + 1 )² + ( k + 1 ) ) / 2The last transformation is simply an application of the first binomial formula. Ok, I ended up making one comment about the transformations, but that’s the only one I’ll make. Just take a look at the last line. It’s our transformed initial formula! Let’s take another quick look at this transformed formula.( n² + n ) / 2Now, just substitute n with k + 1 and you end up with the last line of the induction step.( ( k + 1 )² + ( k + 1 ) ) / 2Great job, that’s all the math there is to it. We have managed to prove the induction step by starting out with an obvious equation, then using our assumption, and finally transforming the equation until we ended up with a final result which showed that the sum from 1 to k +1 is indeed what our formula suggests it should be. Base case plus induction step is now sufficient proof that our formula works for all natural upper limits. The base case makes the first domino drop, the induction step shows that all the other ones will eventually drop as well.Often times, people get a little bit confused why exactly we can simply assume things. How can we assume that the formula already works for a certain “k”? The answer is that there is absolutely nothing wrong with doing this. In fact, every mathematical proof makes assumptions and then some new knowledge is derived from them. Usually, these assumptions are theorems or formulas that have already been proven. In our proof, we had already shown in the base case that such a “k” definitely exists, so assuming this later on in the induction step is perfectly alright.Great job sticking with me all the way to the end! I hope you have gained a basic understanding of what mathematical induction is all about. If you had some trouble with the actual math part at the very end, then please make sure to first learn more about how to properly deal with basic terms and equations. Then just read the last part again and you should be able to follow along just fine. If not, please use the comments section to ask a question. I’ll get back to you as soon as possible.Cantor’s ParadiseMedium’s #1 Math Publication!Follow174 2 MathematicsMathEducationSciencePhilosophy174 claps174 claps2 responsesWritten byCryptoDudeFollowProfessional software developer, hobby mathematician and crypto enthusiast.FollowCantor’s ParadiseFollowMedium’s #1 Math PublicationFollowWritten byCryptoDudeFollowProfessional software developer, hobby mathematician and crypto enthusiast.Cantor’s ParadiseFollowMedium’s #1 Math PublicationMore From MediumLeading Digits and Benford’s LawJoaquin de Castro in Cantor’s ParadiseScience’s Significant Stats ProblemNautilus in Nautilus MagazineThe power of beautyGiovanni Organtini in CARRE4The Math Problems from Good Will Hunting, w/ solutionsJørgen Veisdal in Cantor’s ParadiseDivide and Conquer AlgorithmsJames Le in Cracking The Data Science InterviewDivision should be divided‽John JordanCalculate the square root without using square rootEliran TurgemanCounting the Number of Diagonals of N-sided PolygonAbrar Shariar in The StartupLearn more.Medium is an open platform where 170 million readers come to find insightful and dynamic thinking."
Calculating Vector P-Norms — Linear Algebra for Data Science -IV,https://towardsdatascience.com/calculating-vector-p-norms-linear-algebra-for-data-science-iv-400511cffcf0?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Machine Learning,Data Science,Python,Mathematics,AI","In the Linear Algebra Series, to give you a quick recap, we’ve learned what are vectors, matrices & tensors, how to calculate dot product to solve systems of linear equations, and what are identity and inverse matrices.Continuing the series, the next very important topic is Vector Norms.So,What are Vector Norms?Vector Norms are any functions that map a vector to a positive value which is the magnitude of the vector or the length of the vector. Now, there are different functions that offer us different ways to calculate vector lengths.That’s okay but why are we studying this and what does this vector length represent…?Why learn about Norms??Norms are a very important concept in machine learning and deep learning that is generally used to calculate the error in the predictions of an ML/DL model.The length of the vector usually represents the error between the prediction and the actual observation(label).We often need to calculate the length or magnitude of vectors to be either used directly as a regularization method in ML or as part of broader vector or matrix operations.So, what sort of functions are these?Characteristics of Norm functionsNorms are any functions that are characterized by the following properties:Norms return non-negative values because it’s the magnitude or length of a vector which can’t be negative.Norms are 0 if and only if the vector is a zero vector.Norms follow the triangle inequality i.e. the norm of the sum of two(or more) vectors is less than or equal to the sum of the norms the individual vectors. It simply states that geometrically, the shortest path between any two points is a line.Represented by the equation:∥a+b∥≤∥a∥+∥b∥ where a and b are two vectors and the vertical bars ∥ generally denote the norm.The norm of a vector multiplied by a scalar is equal to the absolute value of this scalar multiplied by the norm of the vector.Representing equation: ∥k⋅x∥=|k|⋅∥x∥Steps to calculate P-normsThe calculation of a P-norm is based on the central formula:∥x∥ₚ=(∑ᵢ|xᵢ|ᵖ)¹/ᵖHere is a quick 4-step process to get the p-norm of a vectorGet the absolute value of each element of the vector.Raise these absolute values to a power p.Calculate the sum of all these raised absolute values.Get the pₜₕ root or raise the power to 1/p on the result of the previous step.Now, based on the value of P in the formula, we get different types of Norms. Let’s discuss these one-by-one:L⁰ NormPutting p = 0 in the formula will get us the L⁰ norm.Anything raised to the power 0 will return 1 except 0. L⁰ is not really a norm because it doesn’t exhibit characteristic #4(described above). Multiplying a constant will give us that number itself.L¹ NormPutting p = 1 gets us L¹ norm. Essentially, the formula would be calculating the sum of the absolute values of the vector.Formula: |x|₁=(∑ᵢ |xᵢ|)This is used to calculate the Mean Absolute Error.Python CodeWe can get the L¹ norm using the linear algebra module of the Numpy package which offers a norm() method. By default, the norm function is set to calculate the L2 norm but we can pass the value of p as the argument. So, for L¹ norm, we’ll pass 1 to it:from numpy import linalg#creating a vectora = np.array([1,2,3])#calculating L¹ normlinalg.norm(a, 1)##output: 6.0L² NormPutting p = 2 gets us L² norm. The formula would be calculating the square root of the sum of the squares of the values of the vector.Also known as the Euclidean norm. This is a widely used norm in Machine learning which is used to calculate the root mean squared error.∥x∥₂ = (∑ᵢ xᵢ²)¹/²So, for a vector u, L² Norm would become:Python CodeAgain, using the same norm function, we can calculate the L² Norm:norm(a) # or you can pass 2 like this: norm(a,2)## output: 3.7416573867739413Squared L² Norm∑ᵢ|xᵢ|²The squared L2 norm is simply the L2 norm but without the square root. Squaring the L2 norm calculated above will give us the L2 norm.It is convenient because it removes the square root and we end up with the simple sum of every squared value of the vector.The squared Euclidean norm is widely used in machine learning partly because it can be calculated with the vector operation xᵀx.Python CodeLet’s verify this in python code:x = np.array([[1], [3], [5], [7]])euclideanNorm = x.T.dot(x)## output: array([[84]])np.linalg.norm(x)**2##ouput: 84.0The Max NormThis is the L∞ norm which simply returns the absolute value of the greatest element of the vector.Formula becomes:‖x‖∞=maxᵢ|xᵢ|Python CodeLet’s verify this in python code, we’ll simply need to pass infinity to the norm function:x = np.array([[1], [3], [5], [7]])norm(x, np.inf)##output: 7.0You can play around with all the python codes here:Google ColaboratoryCalculating Normscolab.research.google.comGraphical VisualisationsLet’s try to analyze the plots graphically. I’ve used the same formula in 2 dimensions(x,y) and the 3rd dimension represents the norm itself.You can check out this surface plotter which I used to get these plots.L¹ NormCreated using https://academo.org/demos/3d-surface-plotter/More like planes attached to each other. X and Y are the parameters here.L² Normhttps://academo.org/demos/3d-surface-plotter/Squared L² Normhttps://academo.org/demos/3d-surface-plotter/The squared L2 norm and L2 norm look similar but there is an important difference here with respect to the steepness of the plot near the zero mark(in the middle blue region). The square L2 norm doesn’t differentiate well between zero and other smaller values. Thus this uncovers one problem with its use.SummaryIn this tutorial, we looked at different ways to calculate vector lengths or magnitudes, called the vector norms.Specifically, we learned how to:calculate the L1 norm which is calculated as the sum of the absolute values of the vector.calculate the L2 norm that is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squared vector values.calculate the max norm which is calculated as the maximum vector values.Data Science with HarshitWith this channel, I am planning to roll out a couple of series covering the entire data science space.

Exploring Fibonacci Formula in Python,https://levelup.gitconnected.com/an-exploration-of-fibonacci-in-python-ac4e7df40d55?source=tag_archive---------2-----------------------,"Mathematics,Python,Programming,Software Engineering,Fibonacci","Let’s explore many different methods and techniques for calculating the Fibonacci Series using Python.The Fibonacci Series is beautiful, fascinating, mysterious! The series is defined as follows: every number is the sum of the two preceding ones. Simple:0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...Calculating Fibonacci IterativelyThe simplest way to calculate a Fibonacci number (n) is simply to start at the beginning and work forwards, iteratively. This solution calculates all previous values, giving it an exponential running time — larger numbers take increasingly longer to calculate.Calculating Fibonacci RecursivelyThe recursive approach to finding Fibonacci numbers is sometimes used as a teaching aid in computer science classes. You can see here that the function calls itself on line 14 — making it recursive.This method works backwards from the starting position until it reaches either 1 or 0. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of all previous recursions.Recursion works because the computer keeps track of where we are using a memory construct known as stack memory. This is limited! Trying to find large Fibonacci numbers would exhaust the stack space.Also: the recursive algorithm suffers from the same time complexity problem as the iterative algorithm — it must calculate all of the values.Using Memoization for Efficient RecursionThe previous recursive function is called repeatedly for some values of i. Instead of recalculating this value, we can use a technique known as memoization.Memoization is simply taking note, or a memorandum, of the previous calculated output values. Then we return the memo instead of re-calculating the value.Python supports memoization very nicely if we use a decorator function. The decorator wraps the algorithm, and intercepts all calls and all return values. By intercepting the calls and the return values, we can store them in a local cache — and in future use the cached answers.We can now apply the memo decorator to our function fibonacci_wrapped and see a very large speed improvement. Unfortunately, recursion limits still apply.Python has a built-in memoization decorator, the least recently used cache lru_cache:@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)We could save ourselves the trouble of writing our own (inefficient!) memoization decorator, and instead use the @functools.lru_cache. Don’t forget to import functools if you want to use this.Using Matrix Multiplication to Calculate Fibonacci NumbersThe previous examples all suffered from the same problem: all preceding values in the sequence needed to be calculated. We can avoid this inefficiency by using matrix multiplication to directly compute the sequence’s value without calculating the predecessors.You can read more about matrix multiplication here:Matrix multiplicationIn mathematics, more specifically linear algebra, matrix multiplication is a binary operation that produces a matrix…en.wikipedia.orgBecause the Fibonacci sequence is linear and predictable, it can be efficiently calculated using linear algebra.This formula requires a constant amount of memory space to complete, and takes linearly longer as the value of n increases.Using the Golden Ratio to Calculate Fibonacci NumbersThis method is included for the sake of completeness!Golden ratioIn mathematics, two quantities are in the golden ratio if their ratio is the same as the ratio of their sum to the…en.wikipedia.orgThe Fibonacci Sequence represents the golden ration perfectly, so we can use Binet’s formula to calculate it:You can see that I’m cheating here. If the sequence number we’re searching for is higher than 71, this function silently cheats and instead uses the matrix multiplication method.The Binet formula is precise algebra. However, computers must use an imprecise representation of floating-point numbers. As the values of n increase, the rounding errors also accumulate.Using Bit Operations to Calculate FibonacciIn an early article, I described some common formulae for performing bit arithmetic on integers. My long-time subscribers may have been wondering why, but now all is revealed!It is important to have an understanding of binary arithmetic before we explore the following ways of calculating Fibonacci numbers.6 Pythonic Bit Manipulation RecipesSome reusable python recipes for manipulating bits to perform fast arithmetic.levelup.gitconnected.comThe Lucas SequenceIn this treatment of Fibonacci numbers, I’d like to also show the Lucas Sequence. Like Fibonacci, Lucas numbers are the sum of their two predecessors — they just begin at a different place:2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, 123, 199, ....The Lucas numbers are therefore very closely related to Fibonacci numbers:Lucas and Fibonacci Numbers are relatedLet’s work with this with n=6 .F(n-1) = F(5) = 3F(n+1) = F(7) = 8F(n-1) + F(n+1) = (3 + 8) = 11L(6) = 11Calculating Fibonacci Numbers with the Djikstra FormulaEdsgar Djikstra was perhaps the most brilliant theoretical computer science in modern history. He proposed an algorithm which uses the powers of the Lucas numbers to derive the related Fibonacci number.Really quite brilliant. Here is the full algorithm:The function fibonacci_djikstra recognisably uses the relationship between Lucas numbers and Fibonacci numbers I showed earlier: L(n) = F(n-1) + F(n+1).It goes a step further, and uses the Lucas power function to exploit a part of Binet’s formula — see the integer 5 in there, and do you recognise that from the Golden Ration discussion?For a more in-depth discussion of Djikstra’s algorithm, feel free to refer to this information.Karatsuba Fast MultiplicationFollowing on from our discussion of binary arithmetic, there is one really interesting way to calculate very large products — Karatsuba multiplication.According to Wikipedia, the Karatsuba algorithm was the first multiplication algorithm asymptotically faster than the quadratic “grade school” algorithm, it offers a speedup of 17.75 times versus the traditional quadratic formula for sufficiently large values.We’ll use this algorithm in our next and final formula for calculating Fibonacci numbers!Recursive Fast Doubling to Calculate FibonacciThe following fast doubling formula uses four tools explained earlier: recursion, memoization, binary arithmetic and Karatsuba multiplication. You can guess why I chose to put this formula last!This formula is very fast. It calculates Fibonacci to the 80'000 place in microseconds on my MacBook Pro.I’ll explain how this works using the iterative variant, next.Iterative Fast Doubling to Calculate FibonacciWe can easily change the forms of an algorithm: from recursive to iterative or iterative to recursive. See how the following, iterative version of the previous differs:It contains two loops. The first successively halves the sequence number we’re looking for. The second successively doubles it on the way back up. The iterative version is obviously slower but avoids overflowing the stack.This algorithm uses an important property identified by number theorists: the “halving property”. It also vastly simplifies the matrix multiplication method by exploiting the formula:There are a lot of squares being calculated, which is where the Karatsuba multiplication is useful.Timing ResultsI thought you might be interested in the timing results. I decided to compare the matrix multiplication algorithm, the fast doubling algorithm, and the Djikstra algorithm. It’s pretty clear that the golden ratio, and the naive iterative and recursive algorithms will be slower.Here is the code to collect the timing data:And here is a graph of the timing results:I hope you enjoyed this article!

What Can You Do With a Math Degree?,https://medium.com/@waldootis/what-can-you-do-with-a-math-degree-52fc47dfccf6?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"Mathematics,Education,Careers,Science,Future","Space Frontiers | Source: LifeIf you know mathematics, you could do anything that you want. The better you are in mathematics, the further you can go with it. It’s really satisfying to understand something that nobody has understood before finally. There’s always going to be a need for people with mathematics. It’s very fundamental. Mathematics underlies a lot of what we do in the world and what we understand about the world around us.Mathematics is a type of language, just like being good at English and grammar. In a lot of cases, I think that math is really ugly, but actually, it is enjoyable, useful, and beyond that, it is just fantastic. We can make a lot of difference in this world if we study mathematics. It gives us the basis to do all kinds of new things to make all kinds of discoveries and make an impact in the lives of our family, friends, and the other people we have always wanted to help.If you have studied mathematics for eight years, your whole life is going to change. The critical thing in eight years is what doors are open for your career. When you’re done with your degree, you get your pick of jobs. Many companies want math majors, and you can choose where you want to go who you want to work for.Mathematics is the foundation of all of the different sciences, and knowing that allows us to choose what we want to do because the door will always be open. These are the some of the job opportunities you can choose: Economist, foreign exchange trader, cryptanalyst, video game developer, risk analyst, quantitative analyst statistician, database administrator, policy analyst, actuary, operations research analyst, epidemiologist, investment banker, pension fund manager, petroleum analyst, market research analyst, physicist, policy analyst, attorney, computer scientist, computational biologist, biophysicist, systems analyst, etc.You can become a programmer, build bridges, or make new drugs. One of my mathematician friends takes data that shows drug concentrations in patients and tumor volumes. Then he takes that data and tries to figure out the model that fits the data to use that model to optimize the drug-disease.Another friend of mine has worked in many different areas, such as homeland security, stockpile stewardship, cybersecurity, and algorithmic research. She currently works at Google on Google Analytics. Google is all about large-scale data and processing. It’s tough to take a complex problem and think about solving it or even simplifying it unless you have that background and the training mathematics.You could go to Wall Street and make millions of dollars analyzing financial stock trades. Or you could work on nuclear weapons research and try to assess probabilities that our nuclear stockpile will be safe. Furthermore, you could work on disease control and try to eradicate diseases using mathematical models.A recent study of the 15 most lucrative careers for college grads showed that all 15 of them had one thing in common: mathematics. If you want to choose any of those jobs, you have to understand mathematics. To make a difference in the world somehow, it feels like the more that you know, the better. And especially the more mathematics you know, you think better.So if you do like mathematics, you’re in luck because there will be more and more demand in the future. It doesn’t matter what your interests are. The thing is you get the major in mathematics, then enter the job that you want to have in the future no matter what it is. Even if you are going to major in piano but try to double major in mathematics. Why? Because mathematics teaches us how to think. It opens a lot of doors.Photo by Samuel Zeller on UnsplashYes, mathematics is challenging. I do not think there’s any mathematician out there that do not find math hard. At some point, mathematics will be a difficult challenge for everyone. But the thing is math is also exciting. And so it compels us to get over the hardness and try to figure out new things. It would be best if you never shied away from difficult challenges. I think that mathematics is one of those things that you can grind it out. It’s worth doing. It’s something that I’ve never heard anyone say, “I wish I did not take so much math.” Do not be shy! Thinking mathematics is only for people who are super smart bothers people. The mathematics is accessible to everybody.So if you are frustrated, hang in there, one day, you might end up loving what you’re doing, and it’s all thanks to mathematics. Mathematics makes us feel good when we do it. There’s a particular part of our brain that gets happy when we do the math. Some people like to solve Sudoku, and some people want to do crossword puzzles; mathematics is just more of that but better.People that are good at mathematics get a job where they have to think like a mathematician. They use their critical thinking. Those jobs are where they get to interact with people and make a difference in the world. One of those jobs where instead of punching in and punching out and saying my eight hours is over today, it’s something that they look forward to going to work in the morning. They get excited on the way, and they cannot wait to tackle today’s problem. That’s the kind of job they want to go to. They are paid better than the ones that are harder to go to.Who would not want to be paid well and have something enjoyed doing?

A Simple Mathematical Model of Privilege,https://medium.com/@ethanmwalker/a-simple-mathematical-model-of-privilege-fcf5b7b9eec8?source=tag_archive---------4-----------------------,"Mathematics,Privilege,Data,Wealth,Success","The question of what privilege is and how it effects outcomes in our society is weighty. Answers to this question can influence how we view ourselves and our accomplishments, how we view others, and the decisions we make as we influence change in the world. Do we view the successful as hard working and deserving of wealth, or as the lucky few that got a break? Do we view the poor as lazy and unproductive, or as underprivileged and unfortunate? Do we define ourselves by our accomplishments or by our character? These fundamental questions about outlook are shaped by how we believe the world conforms to the ideal of “you get what you work for.”Issues of privilege are baked into our society, but before we can find answers, we must build understanding. Understanding privilege and its effects is the first step to creating true equality.What is PrivilegeIn this exploration we will define privilege as the things that are out of our control which contribute to our success. These are things such as the country we were born in, the wealth that we were born into, the opportunities that our parents have provided us. Many of these things fundamentally change the opportunities and outcomes we can expect in our lives. Good schools in childhood lead to good universities which lead to good jobs. Yet we did nothing to choose where we went to high school, or whether or not our parents could afford tutors. In many ways, it is difficult to extract those factors of privilege from the hard work that we have put in. In many ways, the privileged of the world are standing on the shoulders of giants.However, we, as mathematicians, can avoid the complications of determining what is privilege and what is not, by simply saying that there must exist some measure of privilege. Though we have no idea how we could find this measure of privilege, let us assume that each person is somewhere between 0% and 100% privileged. We make this assumption so that we can examine the effects of abstract privilege and gain concrete intuition. This assumption does not posit that I, nor any person, could empirically determine exactly how privileged any single person is, but it allows us to examine the effects of privilege, such as they are.I would like to be very clear that this measure of privilege does not relate in any way to how hard working a person is. Someone can be extremely privileged and work hard; they can also be privileged and lazy. Yet this privilege does find its way into being consequential, regardless of the character of the person. Hence, the second measure we will examine is not “qualification” but work ethic.We do this because there are many situations where privilege increases the qualification of a person for a certain position or accolade. The child of a wealthy business owner may get opportunities to work in the office for example. This experience is meaningful on a résumé or application as a qualification, yet this child got that opportunity because of privilege. Again, this does not mean that the child didn’t work hard when given the opportunity by their parent, but the opportunity was not the result of their work ethic, yet contributes to their qualifications.In many ways, work ethic is the measure rather uninfluenced by privilege, and I hope that the distinction between these two measures is meaningful.Getting Into the Ivy LeagueNow that we understand the two measures we want to examine, we can begin with our first example. In this example we will examine imagined students applying to Harvard. For each student we will generate a random number between 0 and 1 to represent their work ethic, and another number between 0 and 1 to represent their privilege. We then create a score, based on how much we imagine privilege matters in society. If we suppose that privilege determines, say, 10% of why a person gets into Harvard, then we follow this formula: .1*privilege + .9*work ethic = score. This score is then used to determine if the student “gets in” to Harvard.It’s important to note we are not assuming the registrar is looking at a student’s work ethic and privilege and then determining if they get in or not. The effects of privilege are baked into society and together with work ethic, determine a student’s qualification for being admitted.Since we cannot know how much privilege actually factors into why a person gets accepted into Harvard, we will run many simulations with different values for that factor, which we will call bias. For each value of bias, we will examine the mean work ethic and privilege of the students that were accepted. We will also compare the group that was accepted because of their score with the group that would have been accepted if only work ethic mattered. Because privilege has some effect, there must surely be people that would not have been admitted had they not been privileged. This does not mean that these people are not hard workers, but it does mean that they were accepted because of privilege.The Class of PrivilegeIn order to be confident in the results I ran 1,000 simulations at each bias value, and for smooth curves I chose 100 different values of bias. In each simulation I created 33,824 students, each with a random work ethic and privilege value. I chose this number because that is the number of people that applied to enter the Harvard class of 2024. Of those 33,824 applicants only 1,085 were accepted, so in our simulation we will look at the top 1,085 students based on score [1].In the figure below we see the mean work ethic and mean privilege of the accepted applicants for each value of bias between 0 and .6. I was surprised to see that between 0 and .2, a small change in bias results in a large change in mean privilege. Meaning that even if privilege matters very little, it will still result in a high standard of privilege for those that get in.Even if we are generous, and assume that privilege only explains 20% of why someone got into Harvard, the applicants that get in are still very privileged. With this assumption they are, on average, above the 80th percentile for privilege. It is also important to note that the accepted students are all very hard working, much more than average, around the 95th percentile, yet they are, nonetheless very privileged.In the image below we see just how much privilege matters. The curve follows a similar shape to the mean privilege curve above, but represents something very different. As I explained earlier, we are comparing the people that got in because of their score with those that would have been admitted if only work ethic mattered. This curve gives the percentage of accepted applicants that would not have been admitted if only work ethic mattered.Refining The PoolYet we know that the students applying to Harvard are not just random students. Those that apply to Harvard are among the best students that have graduated from high school. So because of our assumption our perspective is limited; we are ignoring the fact that these students have already proven themselves against another larger group. But how can we know the work ethic and privilege of the students that have applied, given this wider view?One way to approximate the distribution is to modify the simulation. Let consider all the students that graduated high school in 2019. This gives us a pool of 3.7 million students, each with a work ethic and privilege value [2]. We can’t be certain that only the top 33,824 best students applied, but we might assume that the students that applied were all above the 90th percentile. Since there are 370,000 students above the 90th percentile, we will then choose 33,824 students randomly from that group. These randomly chosen students will be the applicants, and from that group we will select the 1,085 best scoring students as those admitted into Harvard.The goal of this procedure is to simulate the appropriate distribution of work ethic and privilege of the applicants to Harvard, so that we can better understand the effects of privilege on who gets admitted into Harvard. Again, for every value of bias I ran the simulation 1,000 times.As we can see, and should have expected, the effects of privilege are accentuated when we take into account the privilege of those that even apply to Harvard. The mean privilege of those admitted is very high, even for extraordinarily small values of bias. This of course doesn’t invalidate the hard work of those that got in, because the mean work ethic is also high, even for large values of bias, but we do see that high levels of privilege become common, or rather necessary, in situations like this.This story is especially strong when we see the percentage of people that got in because of privilege. Even for unrealistically low values of bias, almost all the candidates would not have been admitted if privilege didn’t play a role. It’s important to note that in this case, we are not just comparing the admitted group to the applicant group, we are comparing the admitted group to the entire high school graduate group. There are ostensibly many people that do not apply because of a lack of privilege.For example, the Harvard application fee is $75, and there could be many students that are very hard working, but not privileged enough to afford that fee. Maybe the $50 SAT fee too much, or maybe they could afford it once, but couldn’t afford to take it as many times as needed to get the score that reflects their best work. There could be students the just needed the push of a tutor to shine in school or gain full understanding, but their parents couldn’t afford it. Suffice it to say, there are many people who could have the work ethic to get in, if that were the only qualification, but because there are other limiting factors privilege becomes consequential.This example may convince us that privilege is much more meaningful in determining the success of a person than we would have originally expected. Especially if privilege could explain more the 50% of why someone is successful, and people on the top are still extremely hard working.The Great and Privileged Among UsThe world is a competitive place, and in a world that is somewhat unwilling to spread its resources evenly, that competition creates an inflated need of privilege to achieve success. For example we might look at all the people that get an MBA with goals to become a CEO. There are about 1,792,000 people with an MBA in the US [3]. If we assume that a little more than 5% of those people generally have the goal of becoming the CEO of a Fortune 500 company we have 100,000 people competing for 500 positions. It is in cases like these where privilege becomes necessary, even in an ideal society where privilege matters very little.I ran 100,000 simulations with the assumption that privilege determines only 5% of why someone becomes a CEO. Even with that generous assumption, I found that on average almost all of the 500 CEOs , 99.8%, would not have become a CEO had they not been privileged.Remember, I am not saying that we can be certain 99% of all Fortune 500 CEOS are only CEOs because of privilege, nor am I saying that none of them work hard. In fact all of the candidates that became CEO had very high work ethic scores. This application simply gives us an intuition for understanding how much privilege can factor into outcomes in society. Even if we can be convinced to believe that privilege has almost no influence in success, we still find that those that are successful are often successful because of privilege.The Wider WorldIf we use our score as a measure of the percentile of success we can apply the intuition we’ve gained in the Harvard and CEO examples to the wider world. We can now apply this analysis to any aspect of life on which we measure success. Ideally, what we have learned in these simplified examples will prepare us to grapple with the complexity and nuance we will encounter in the real world. We must take care in how we implement policies. We must do the work to understand the intersections of privilege, and what we can do to help the underprivileged succeed and to truly make the world a better more equal place.Works Cited[1] https://www.toptieradmissions.com/resources/college-admissions-statistics/harvard-university-acceptance-rates/[2] https://nces.ed.gov/blogs/nces/post/back-to-school-by-the-numbers-2019-20-school-year[3] https://www.vox.com/2014/5/20/5734816/masters-degrees-are-as-common-now-as-bachelors-degrees-were-in-the-60sFootnoteThis is inspired by a Veritasium video that explores more of the social consequences of privilege.

This paper is about Univariate Linear Regression(ULR) which is the simplest version of LR.The paper contains following topics:The basics of datasets in Machine Learning;What is Univariate Linear Regression?How to represent the algorithm(hypothesis), Graphs of functions;Cost function (Loss function);Gradient Descent.The basics of datasets in Machine LearningIn ML problems, beforehand some data is provided to build the model upon. The datasets contain of rows and columns. Each row represents an example, while every column corresponds to a feature.Then the data is divided into two parts — training and test sets. With percent, training set contains approximately 75%, while test set has 25% of total data. Training set is used to build the model. After model return success percent over about 90–95% on training set, it is tested with test set. Result with test set is considered more valid, because data in test set is absolutely new to the model.What is Univariate Linear Regression?In Machine Learning problems, the complexity of algorithm depends on the provided data. When LR is used to build the ML model, if the number of features in training set is one, it is called Univariate LR, if the number is higher than one, it is called Multivariate LR. To learn Linear Regression, it is a good idea to start with Univariate Linear Regression, as it simpler and better to create first intuition about the algorithm.Hypothesis, graphsTo get intuitions about the algorithm I will try to explain it with an example. The example is a set of data on Employee Satisfaction and Salary level.Figure 1. Raw datasetAs it is seen from the picture, there is linear dependence between two variables. Here Employee Salary is a “X value”, and Employee Satisfaction Rating is a “Y value”. In this particular case there is only one variable, so Univariate Linear Regression can be used in order to solve this problem.In the following picture you will see three different lines.Figure 2. 3 lines on the datasetThis is already implemented ULR example, but we have three solutions and we need to choose only one of them. Visually we can see that Line 2 is the best one among them, because it fits the data better than both Line 1 and Line 3. This is rather easier decision to make and most of the problems will be harder than that. The following paragraphs are about how to make these decisions precisely with the help of mathematical solutions and equations.Now let’s see how to represent the solution of Linear Regression Models (lines) mathematically:Here,hθ(x) — the answer of the hypothesisθ0 and θ1 — parameters we have to calculate to fit the line to the datax — the point from the datasetThis is exactly same as the equation of line — y = mx + b. As the solution of Univariate Linear Regression is a line, equation of line is used to represent the hypothesis(solution).Let’s look at an example. For instance, there is a point in the provided training set — (x = 1.9; y = 1.9) and the hypothesis of h(x) = -1.3 + 2x. When this hypothesis is applied to the point, we get the answer of approximately 2.5.After the answer is got, it should be compared with y value (1.9 in the example) to check how well the equation works. In this particular example there is difference of 0.6 between real value — y, and the hypothesis. So for this particular case 0.6 is a big difference and it means we need to improve the hypothesis in order to fit it to the dataset better.But here comes the question — how can the value of h(x) be manipulated to make it as possible as close to y? In order to answer the question, let’s analyze the equation. There are three parameters — θ0, θ1, and x. X is from the dataset, so it cannot be changed (in example the pair is (1.9; 1.9), and if you get h(x) = 2.5, you cannot change the point to (1.9; 2.5)). So we left with only two parameters (θ0 and θ1) to optimize the equation. In optimization two functions — Cost function and Gradient descent, play important roles, Cost function to find how well the hypothesis fit the data, Gradient descent to improve the solution.Cost function (Loss function)In the examples above, we did some comparisons in order to determine whether the line is fit to the data or not. In the first one, it was just a choice between three lines, in the second, a simple subtraction. But how will we evaluate models for complicated datasets? It is when Cost function comes to aid. In a simple definition, Cost function evaluates how well the model (line in case of LR) fits to the training set. There are various versions of Cost function, but we will use the one below for ULR:Here,m — number of examples in training set;h — answer of hypothesis;y — y values of points in the dataset.The optimization level of the model is related with the value of Cost function. The smaller the value is, the better the model is. Why? The answer is simple — Cost is equal to the sum of the squared differences between value of the hypothesis and y. If all the points were on the line, there will not be any difference and answer would be zero. To put it another way, if the points were far away from the line, the answer would be very large number. To sum up, the aim is to make it as small as possible.So, from this point, we will try to minimize the value of the Cost function.Gradient DescentIn order to get proper intuition about Gradient Descent algorithm let’s first look at some graphs.This is dependence graph of Cost function from theta. As mentioned above, the optimal solution is when the value of Cost function is minimum. In Univariate Linear Regression the graph of Cost function is always parabola and the solution is the minima.Gradient Descent is the algorithm such that it finds the minima:Here,α — learning rate;The equation may seem a little bit confusing, so let’s go over step by step.What is this symbol — ‘:=’?Firstly, it is not same as ‘=’. ‘:=’ means “to update the left side value”, here it is not possible to use ‘=’ mathematically, because a number cannot be equal to subtraction of itself and something else (zero is an exception in this case).2. What is ‘j’?‘j’ is related to the number of features in the dataset. In Univariate Linear Regression there is only one feature and j is equal to 2. ‘j’ = number of features + 1.3. What is ‘alpha’?‘alpha’ is learning rate. Its value is usually between 0.001 and 0.1 and it is a positive number. If it is high the algorithm may ‘jump’ over the minima and diverge from solution. If it is low the convergence will be slow. In most cases several instances of ‘alpha’ is tired and the best one is picked.4. The term of partial derivative.Cost function mentioned above:Cost function with definition of h(x) substituted:Derivative of Cost function:5. Why is derivative used and sing before alpha is negative?The answer of the derivative is the slope. The example graphs below show why derivate is so useful to find the minima.In the first graph above, the slope — derivative is positive. As is seen, the interception point of line and parabola should move towards left in order to reach optima. For that, the X value(theta) should decrease. Now let’s remember the equation of the Gradient descent — alpha is positive, derivative is positive (for this example) and the sign in front is negative. Overall the value is negative and theta will be decreased.In the second example, the slope — derivative is negative. As is seen, the interception point of line and parabola should move towards right in order to reach optima. For that, the X value(theta) should increase. Now let’s remember the equation of the Gradient descent — alpha is positive, derivative is negative (for this example) and the sign in front is negative. Overall the value is positive and theta will be increased.The coming section will be about Multivariate Linear Regression.Thank you.Analytics VidhyaAnalytics Vidhya is a community of Analytics and Data…Follow1 Sign up for Data Science Blogathon: Win Lucrative Prizes!By Analytics VidhyaLaunching the Second Data Science Blogathon – An Unmissable Chance to Write and Win Prizesprizes worth INR 30,000+! Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

The Bridge and Lantern Riddle,https://medium.com/@sarpajian/the-bridge-and-lantern-riddle-a4533e053b68?source=tag_archive---------6-----------------------,"Riddle,Math,Mathematics,Bridge,Lantern","My 16-year-old son came home from his second day of school and challenged me with this math riddle, which he learned in class. He stumped me, which scared me on many levels, especially since I used to pride myself on being pretty good at these.This riddle, it turns out, is fairly well known and has appeared in Popular Mechanics and even a TedEd animation.Here it is for you to solve on your own. Stumped like I was? Scroll all the way down for the solution.The RiddleFour people are trying to cross a bridge. They all need to get across the bridge within 17 minutes, and they each travel across the bridge at different speeds:Person A only needs 1 minute to cross the bridge.Person B needs 2 minutes to cross the bridge.Person C needs 5 minutes to cross the bridge.Person D is pretty slow and requires a full 10 minutes to cross the bridge.And there are a few additional challenges to consider.The bridge can only hold two people at a time.It’s dark and dangerous on the bridge. To safely cross, they must use a single shared lantern to light the way. The lantern must be used at all times while crossing the bridge in either direction.Can you figure out the right sequence? It’s more challenging than it sounds and requires you to consider a series of trips that might seem counter-intuitive at first.It’s a good lesson that the fastest and most efficient way to get something done isn’t always the most direct or obvious path.Read below for the full solution.SolutionTo get everyone across the bridge in 17 minutes, the group needs to travel in five segments. The non-obvious part of the solution is that Persons A and B each need to make two full trips across the bridge and back again.Person A and Person B cross the bridge (2 minute trip, 2 minutes cumulative).Person A returns alone (1 minute trip, 3 minutes cumulative).Person C and D cross the bridge (10 minute trip, 13 minutes cumulative).Person B returns alone (2 minutes, 15 minutes cumulative).Person A and Person B cross the bridge together again (2 minutes, 17 minutes cumulative).Written byScott ArpajianLifelong dreamer and downloader.

Probability and Statistics 7 | Acceptance Rejection Method,https://medium.com/adamedelwiess/probability-and-statistics-7-acceptance-rejection-method-c375f36d9045?source=tag_archive---------7-----------------------,"Mathematics,Rejection Sample,Statistics,Algorithms","Acceptance Rejection Method(1) Recall: Computable Inverse CDFFor the method of inverse transforms, one of the things that we should recall is that we needed a computable inverse of some cumulative distribution function.(2) A question to Think About: What if there’s no easily inverse of the given CDF of the target random variable?We can use the acceptance-rejection method in order to deal with these kinds of problems. So basically, the acceptance rejection method is a method that we used when the CDF or the inverse of CDF is not possible to access.(3) Auxiliary random variableAn auxiliary random variable is been chosen ideally so that it is easy for us to simulate random numbers. For example, you can use the method of inverse transforms because there is a computable inverse.(4) The Context for Acceptance Rejection MethodTarget a random variable X and its PDF fAuxiliary random variable Y and its PDF gGenerate a random tuple (x, y) under the space of g. Then there can be two results, the first will be this dot is created between f and g, and another is that this dot is underneath both f and g. For example,Then, compute f(x) and compare it with y. If f(x) < y, we reject this dot. Else if f(x) > y, we accept this dot.(5) The Definition of RealizationThe realization of a random variable is an observed value, which is the value we actually observed form that random variable.(5) The Acceptance Rejection Method AlgorithmSimulate a realization u of random variable U ~ Unif(0, 1)Independently, simulate a realization y from Y, the auxiliary random variable with PDF gthen we can have,If u < f(y)/Mg(y), then accept u as a realization of random variable X; if not then reject u and back to the first stepNote that the constant M is usually chosen as the largest value attained by f(x)/g(x) over the support set A of random variable X and random variable Y. It is the same meaning of M is the supremum (least upper bound) of f(x)/g(x).The only condition for this algorithm to be true is that the probability of Y ≤ y given U ≤ f(Y)/Mg(Y) is the same as F(y). It is written as,So we have to prove this.(6) The Proof of the Acceptance Rejection MethodSuppose we define the event A and B asby,then we have,the random variable Y has a density g, and suppose the CDF of random variable Y is G, by definition we can derive,It is also that,then,then,then,then,so we can have,there is also,so that,then,then,then,then,thus,SereneFieldIgnite fervor in Serene Field.Follow3 MathematicsRejection SampleStatisticsAlgorithms3 claps3 clapsWritten byAdam EdelweissFollowKnowledge is power, especially when it‘s shared.

Showcasing Kotlin with Complex Numbers and Polynomials — Part I,https://medium.com/software-science/showcasing-kotlin-with-complex-numbers-e62417442081?source=tag_archive---------8-----------------------,"Kotlin,Programming,Mathematics,Science,Data Science","When I first encountered Kotlin, I was excited that it was completely inter-operable with Java and it supported operator overloading. Operator overloading is essential in making a language more palatable to a programmer implementing mathematical operations.Consider for example, this simple equation in JavaEven such a small equation looks awkward and confusing. What we really want to say, and see is:My first impulse was to write a library for complex arithmetic in Kotlin and in the process of doing so, I discovered other cool Kotlin features, like extensions, destructuring, and infix notation, which I can exploit to write complex arithmetic expressions almost as if I were writing them on paper.There are of course already abundant complex libraries in all languages. My objective was not to re-invent the wheel, but to make the writing of arithmetic operations intuitively obvious. The following snippets of code are equivalent:Complex c = new Complex(1, -1).times(new Complex(0, 2).minus(new Complex(1, 0)));--------------------------------------------------------------------val c = (1-i)*(2*i-1)but the second is much easier to read.Operator OverloadingThe first step is to define the Complex class and overload the arithmetic operators.That’s a good start. Now I can write expression such as this:It’s not quite perfect yet. The Complex constructor is a bit awkward. Also, whereas we can write expressions like c1*2 and c1*3.5 we cannot write 2*c1 and 3.5*c1, since Complex knows how to multiply itself with Number, but not vice versa.What we really like to have is something like this: val c1 = 2.0–3.1*iExtension FunctionsFirst, let’s make Kotlin understand what i means¹. This is simple. We can introduce the global (well, package-specific) declaration:val i = Complex(0.0, 1.0)Now we need to make expression like this make sense: c1 = 2*c2.That’s where Kotlin’s extension functions come in handy. These allow you to define functions on a pre-existing class without actually extending the class. For example, if I want a function isEven() on BigInteger, I can do it like this:fun BigInteger.isEven() : Boolean {    return this.toInt() % 2 == 0}or even more compactly:fun BigInteger.isEven() = this.toInt() % 2 == 0We can also extend operators:Now we are cooking. Instead of declaring a complex number withval c = Complex(1, 0.5)I can write it out asval c = 1.0 + 0.5 * iand I can defined arithmetic expressions that look pretty natural:val c1 = PI * ival c2 = (2 - 5*i)/ c1Destructuring and InfixTo get the real and imaginary parts of a complex number c, I can just say c.real and c.img or use Kotlin’s destructuring capability to get them in a pair:val (x, y) = Complex(1, 2)assertEquals(1.0, x)assertEquals(2.0, y)Defining the standard functions for complex numbers, such as exponential, trig, hyperbolic, et cetera, is pretty straightforward. I had some trouble finding a natural way to denote powers. Most languages, including Kotlin, do not support superscripts, so we can’t have c². The next best thing, c^ 2, is also not possible. However, I was able to use Kotlin’s infix notation to come up with thatval cSquare = c to 2Here is the implementationNote that I used an optimization for integer powers to compute it in log(n) time instead of linear.In the second part of this article, I will describe how I used the same concepts to implement arithmetic operations for complex polynomials.The complete code for this project can be found in the github repository.¹ Mathematicians and Physicists use i to denote the imaginary unit. Engineers use j because to them i can only stand for electric current. Physicists use j for current. I chose to use i because I want to reserve j and k for implementing Quaternions.Software ScienceMath + Data + Computer Science = Sotware ScienceFollow10 KotlinProgrammingMathematicsScienceData Science10 claps10 clapsWritten byDimitri PapaioannouFollowFollowSoftware ScienceFollowMusings on Math, Data Science, and Sotware EngineeringFollowWritten byDimitri PapaioannouFollowSoftware ScienceFollowMusings on Math, Data Science, and Sotware EngineeringMore From MediumGraphQL for the Beginner PythonistasVasileios Anagnostopoulos in The StartupWhat is a Polyglot Programmer — And Why You Should Become OnePaul AzorinWriting your first Apache Pulsar Function in KotlinPierre-Yves LebecqBasic Python Tutorial | Python For Data ScienceNosin Ibna Mahbub in Dev GeniusPragmatic Performance Tuning For DjangoJames Broad8 Must-Use CSS Tools For Web DevelopersMahdhi Rezvi in Better ProgrammingExplore REST APIs with cURLErik EngheimProcessing Multipart/Form-Data using API Gateway and a Java Lambda Proxy for storage in S3Jeremy Glesner in The StartupLearn more.Medium is an open platform where 170 million readers come to find insightful and dynamic thinking."
The Arrow of Time [1]: What Thermodynamics Doesn’t Tell You,https://medium.com/@tim.lou/the-arrow-of-time-1-what-thermodynamics-doesnt-tell-you-6fa579fb1a53?source=tag_archive---------9-----------------------,"Physics,Science,Statistics,Mathematics,Philosophy","The irreversibility of time is ubiquitous, but it’s not so obvious why that has to be the case (Photo by Aron Visuals)“An inch of time is an inch of gold”: The transience of time has been known since time immemorial. Unlike trekking across an open plain or diving into the ocean’s depths, one can neither explore around nor remain stationary in time. With every tick of the clock, we are faced with the relentless advancement of time.Time’s irreversibility seems contradictory: Einstein’s theory of Relativity unified space and time, and the laws of physics are (approximately) the same in all directions (including forward and backward in time). Yet, our Universe seems to have picked out a unique direction — the arrow of time. Where does this special direction come from?One of the most popular explanations comes from thermodynamics, where the concept of entropy is introduced. The direction of time is aligned with entropy’s increase. This supposedly explains why time is special — it is the unique direction that is picked out by the increase of entropy.Yet, there is something unsettling about this explanation: It seems like we can just explain away the arrow of time by this magical quantity called entropy, without any reference to fundamental physics. The reasoning seems incomplete as well; why does entropy have to increase in the first place?Indeed, I’d argue that the entropic explanation is not much of an explanation at all. Instead, thermodynamics merely rephrases the original question.Let’s examine what thermodynamics tells us.Thermodynamics: An Effective ApproximationThermodynamics has one essential assumption:Thermodynamics approximates a system using random processes and statistics.Thermodynamics approximates dynamics of physical systems as random rolling of dice (by Riho Kroll)To understand how this works, let’s go through an example. Take a standard 6-sided die. Rolling the die yields six outcomes each with 1/6 probability. Now, if I were to divide these six numbers into two categories, let’s say:Lucky numbers: 5, 6Unlucky numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4then a die-roll will be more likely to yield an unlucky number than a lucky number. We can quantify how “lucky” or “unlucky” a category is by counting the number of possibilities (2 vs. 4). The number of possibilities (or its logarithm) is captured by the concept of entropy — there is some level of subjectivity in its definition (I have written another article that offers more insights on this idea).Going back to the physics analogy, the die represents a physical system. The system is assumed to change rapidly and randomly such that each measurement of the system is approximated by a roll of the die. Each side of the die represents a state, and each category corresponds to a set of macroscopic physical quantities. The categories of lucky numbers can be referred to as low entropy states, and the categories of unlucky numbers as high entropy states.Thermodynamics tells us how to count the number of states for a particular category. Each category is characterized by physical properties such as temperature, magnetization, different phases of matter, different amounts of pressure in a gas, and so on.The Arrow of Time: A Thermodynamic ExplanationSo why does entropy have to increase? Well, since a measurement is akin to rolling the die once, the result is more likely to be a high-entropy state (e.g., unlucky numbers). In particular, if the number of sides of the die is increasing as time goes on, then gradually the entropy of the system (defined by the entropy of the category that it is in) will always tend to increase. In other words:An increase in entropy is equivalent to the shift from a lucky roll to an unlucky rollSo in this view, the increase of entropy is critically dependent on the fact that our system was previously in a low-entropy state, so that there is room to move to a higher-entropy state! Otherwise, the system wouldn’t change in the first place.At this point, it is clear that the entropic explanation is rather contrived. Why does the system have a lower entropy in the first place (why do we get progressively less lucky rolls over time)? Generally, this happens because the system initially had some extra restrictions, preventing it from exploring the full range of possible states. In other words:The number of explorable states for the system was smaller in the beginning than in the end.Entropy’s increase is then ultimately tied to the (apparent) gradual increase of the number of explorable states. Of course, all of this discussion will be vacuous if we cannot explain how non-random physical processes can be approximated by random ones. In the end, a complete explanation for the arrow of time needs to go beyond thermodynamics.Epilogue: Looking BeyondTo complete the thermodynamic explanation, we must answer two more questions:How is it that the dynamics of a physical system can be approximated by random processes?Why does the number of states available for exploration get smaller as we travel further back in time?The answers to these questions lie beyond thermodynamics. It turns out that there are two key issues at play:Complex dynamics explains how processes are seemingly randomThe initial conditions of the universe (near the Big Bang) are ultimately responsible for the seemingly smaller number of explorable states at the beginning of timeI’ll dedicate separate articles to each of these topics in the future.

Lets (De)Code The Birthday Paradox!,https://medium.com/@himangshushekharjha/lets-de-code-the-birthday-paradox-9741d2f8b09b?source=tag_archive---------10-----------------------,"Computer Science,Mathematics,Algorithms,Development,Research","Okay, so even before starting to read the paragraph,what comes to our mind by seeing the title is what could be the meaning of “Birthday Paradox” .So, let me tell you a story of what happened recently. I was sitting in a seminar hall, that occupy around 70 people, filling a feedback form regarding the seminar. Having filled the necessary details, I gazed on the form of the person sitting just next to me. Coincidentally, we were sharing the same date of birth. Ignoring the year of birth, as almost all the people in the hall were of my age, the important thing was that our birthday clashed.This gave me a reason to ponder how many such people in the hall shared a birthday with me. So, I tried to find an answer to some of the questions related to the fact.Q.1) How many people must have been there to make it sure (100% probability) that atleast two people share the same birthday?Ans) 367? If you are thinking that, you are absolutely correct. The reason for 367 is that there are 366 days in an year(considering birthdays on 29th Feb as well) and even if every 366 people have birthdays on different day of the year, it is guaranteed that the 367th person will have a birthday that clashes with atleast one person out of the 366 people. Mathematically, one can prove this using the Pigeonhole principle.Q.2) So, what would have been the probability that atleast two people share the same birthday in a hall containing 70 people where I was seated?Ans) 99.9%. Not Astonished Yet? Isn't it intriguing to figure out that it takes more 297 people (367–70 ) to make the event 100%?So, I hope now we have enough of motivation to derive these probabilities.Lets Start DecodingGoal : To get a generalized formula that relates the probability of getting atleast two people having the same birthday with the number of people required to get that probability.So, lets start by answering what is the probability that atleast two people among n have the same birthday?let p = probability that atleast two people share the same birthday, and, p’ = probability that NO people share the same birthday.Certainly , p = 1 — p’Now, Lets calculate p’.Calculating the probability when no one has the same birthdayCould also be written as :This will be used in the next step (Eq-1).Explanation :The first person could have his/her birthday any-day, so, his/her probability — 365/365. (Possible days = 365–0).The second person can have his/her birthday any-day except the day in which the first person was born 364/365. (Possible days = 365–1).The third person can have birthday on any of the remaining 363 days, so 363/365. (Possible days = 365–2).Finally the last person can have birthday on the remaining 365-(n-1) days. Thus ,the probability, (365-(n-1))/365.Now that we have calculated p’, it make us one step closer to our goal.Now, Lets Approximate the expression we got :Using Taylor Series,First order approximation of e^x :-Eq-2For (t+1)’th person, the probability of having a birthday would be :p(t) = (1-(t/365)). (So, For 3rd person : p(2) = 1–2/365 = 363/365)So, to get something of the form p(t) lets put x = -(t/365) in Eq-2 , we get:Eq- 3Woah… Now What? We just have to use Eq-3 and solve Eq-1 for obtaining p .So, by replacing everything of the form 1-(t/365) to e^(-t/365) in the Eq-1, we get p’ as :Using p = 1 — p’ ,Now , n(n-1) = n² (approx). Putting this, p becomes :Probability that atleast 2 people share their birthday in a hall containing n peopleHurray, we finally did what we wanted. So, now given the number of people, we can tell the probability that two people share their birthday.Now let’s also answer the reverse of the above question by simply taking loge(natural log) both side:Lets Start CodingGreat!! So, that was the Birthday Paradox!!Significance To Computer ScienceLets make use of the above code and give p = 0.999 as the argument to the function. The number of people required for this probability is just 72.

A Stochastic Estimation of Pi in Python,https://medium.com/explorations-in-python/a-stochastic-estimation-of-pi-in-python-767eb227d2f?source=tag_archive---------11-----------------------,"Python,Python Programming,Pi,Stochastics,Mathematics","Image: PixabayThe graphic below shows a square with sides of length 2 containing a circle with a radius of 1. The area of the square is 4 and the area of the circle is 3.141592654 (sound familiar?!). The ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the square is 0.785398163 which is π / 4.A while ago I wrote an article on estimating pi using various formulae, and in this post I will use the circle-within-a-square ratio illustrated above to run a stochastic simulation in Python to estimate a value of π.StochasticsThe word stochastic comes from the Greek meaning “to aim at a target”, but in general modern usage refers to simulations using random variables.Such simulations are widely used in many fields from economics to meteorology, including many areas which fall into the category of artificial intelligence and machine learning. The general principle behind stochastics is that it is impossible to accurately capture and model complex systems with vast numbers of data points, but using appropriate random data we can model a simulated system which, by the “law of averages” will closely match the real world. If it does not then the model and/or method of generating random values can be tweaked.For this project I will combine the “aim at a target” and “simulation using random variables” meanings of stochastic to simulate firing a large number of arrows at the square in the graphic above. If we keep a count of the proportion of arrows which land in the circle this should be somewhere in the region of 0.785398163. When our virtual quiver is empty we can multiply the ratio we end up with by 4 to get an estimation of π.This is not of course the best way of estimating pi and using it to do so is frankly overkill. However, it does give a simple introduction into the principle of using random variables in a simulation.The ProjectThe project consists of the following files which you can clone or download from the Github repository.stochasticpi.pymain.pyLet’s first look at stochasticpi.py.At the top of the file we import random and math, and then within start we first set up a few variables, all initialized to 0. We then enter a loop from 0 to the number of iterations.Firing an arrow is simulated by setting x and y to random values between -1 and 1. (This assumes the centre of the square is 0,0.) We then call a separate function to check if the arrow hit the circle; if so circle_hits is incremented. We then update the estimate of pi. At the end of the loop we check if the current iteration is a multiple of the output interval; if so we print the estimate arrived at so far. This process slows everything down a lot so if you are just interested in the end result you could remove it as well as the output_interval argument. If you do then you will only need to calculate pi_estimate once at the end.The process of checking whether an arrow has hit the circle is carried out by a separate function called _in_unit_circle. This uses the old “square on the hypotenuse is equal to…”, the values of x and y being “the other two sides” and the line from the centre of the circle to x, y being the hypotenuse. If the hypotenuse is <= 1 then the point is inside the circle, otherwise it is outside.That’s stochasticpi.py finished so let’s write a main function to try it out.Just a single line in main to call the start function, so run the program with this command:python3.8 main.pyThe output is:Every run will be different and in this run I only got 3dp of accuracy despite using a million arrows. However, the purpose of this post was to demonstrate a technique rather than develop a practical solution.Explorations in PythonExplorations and experiments in PythonFollow2 PythonPython ProgrammingPiStochasticsMathematics2 claps2 clapsWritten byChris WebbFollowI am a software engineer based in London and I write articles on JavaScript, Python, C and other programming topics.FollowExplorations in PythonFollowPractical and useful projects and tutorials in the Python programming languageFollowWritten byChris WebbFollowI am a software engineer based in London and I write articles on JavaScript, Python, C and other programming topics.Explorations in PythonFollowPractical and useful projects and tutorials in the Python programming languageMore From MediumAdapting Ubuntu for the Automotive: quick boot and power-loss resilienceFrancesco MontefoschiSkiptracing: Automated Hook ResolutionSam Lerner in The StartupForget Boilerplate, Use Repository Templates!Liliana Nuño Silva in Better ProgrammingHost your Flutter Project as a REST APIRody DavisA New Way of Dispatching Actions With Ngxs for AngularAlessia Amitrano in Better ProgrammingIncrease GlusterFS volume size in KubernetesAymen Lamara in WeScaleFace Morphing — A Step-by-step Tutorial with CodeAzmarie WangTutorial on How to Merge Django ORM with SQLAlchemy for Easier Data AnalysisDjango Stars in HackerNoon.comLearn more.Medium is an open platform where 170 million readers come to find insightful and dynamic thinking."

"The Beauty of Bayesian Optimization, Explained in Simple Terms",https://towardsdatascience.com/the-beauty-of-bayesian-optimization-explained-in-simple-terms-81f3ee13b10f?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Data Science,Mathematics,Statistics,Machine Learning,Artificial Intelligence","Here’s a function: f(x). It’s expensive to calculate, not necessarily an analytic expression, and you don’t know its derivative.Your task: find the global minima.This is, for sure, a difficult task, one more difficult than other optimization problems within machine learning. Gradient descent, for one, has access to a function’s derivatives and takes advantage of mathematical shortcuts for faster expression evaluation.Alternatively, in some optimization scenarios the function is cheap to evaluate. If we can get hundreds of results for variants of an input x in a few seconds, a simple grid search can be employed with good results.Or, an entire host of non-conventional non-gradient optimization methods can be used, like particle swarming or simulated annealing.Unfortunately, the current task doesn’t have these luxuries. We are limited in our optimization by several fronts, notably:It’s expensive to calculate. Ideally we would be able to query the function enough to essentially replicate it, but our optimization method must work with a limited sampling of inputs.The derivative is unknown. There’s a reason why gradient descent and its flavors still remain the most popular methods for deep learning, and sometimes, in other machine learning algorithms. Knowing the derivative gives the optimizer a sense of direction — we don’t have this.We need to find the global minima, which is a difficult task even for a sophisticated method like gradient descent. Our model somehow will need a mechanism to avoid getting caught in local minima.The solution: Bayesian optimization, which provides an elegant framework for approaching problems that resemble the scenario described to find the global minimum in the smallest number of steps.Let’s construct a hypothetical example of function c(x), or the cost of a model given some input x. Of course, what the function looks like will be hidden from the optimizer; this is the true shape of c(x). This is known in the lingo as the ‘objective function’.Bayesian optimization approaches this task through a method known as surrogate optimization. For context, a surrogate mother is a women who agrees to bear a child for another person — in that context, a surrogate function is an approximation of the objective function.The surrogate function is formed based on sampled points.Based on the surrogate function, we can identify which points are promising minima. We decide to sample more from these promising regions and update the surrogate function accordingly.Each iteration, we continue to look at the current surrogate function, learn more about areas of interest by sampling, and update the function. Note that the surrogate function will be mathematically expressed in a way that is significantly cheaper to evaluate (e.g. y=x to be a an approximation for a more costly function, y=arcsin((1-cos²x)/sin x) within a certain range).After a certain number of iterations, we’re destined to arrive at a global minima, unless the function’s shape is very bizarre (in that it has large and wild up-and-down swings) at which a better question than optimization should be asked: what’s wrong with your data?Take a moment to marvel at the beauty of this approach. It doesn’t make any assumptions about the function (except that it is optimizable in the first place), doesn’t require information about derivatives, and is able to use common-sense reasoning through the ingenious use of a continually updated approximation function. The expensive evaluation of our original objective function is not a problem at all.This is a surrogate-based approach towards optimization. So what makes it Bayesian, exactly?The essence of Bayesian statistics and modelling is the updating of a prior (previous) belief in light of new information to produce an updated posterior (‘after’) belief. This is exactly what surrogate optimization in this case does, so it can be best represented through Bayesian systems, formulas, and ideas.Let’s take a closer look at the surrogate function, which are usually represented by Gaussian Processes, which can be thought of as a dice roll that returns functions fitted to given data points (e.g. sin, log) instead of numbers 1 to 6. The process returns several functions, which have probabilities attached to them.Left: Several Gaussian process-generated functions for four data points. Right: The functions aggregated. Source: Oscar Knagg, image free to share.This article by Oscar Knagg gives good intuition on how GPs work.There’s a good reason why Gaussian Processes, and not some other curve-fitting method, is used to model the surrogate function: it is Bayesian in nature. A GP is a probability distribution, like a distribution of end results of an event (e.g. 1/2 chance of a coin flip), but over all possible functions.For instance, we may define the current set of data points as being 40% representable by function a(x), 10% by function b(x), etc. By representing the surrogate function as a probability distribution, it can be updated with new information through inherently probabilistic Bayesian processes. Perhaps when new information is introduced, the data is only 20% representable by function a(x). These changes are governed by Bayesian formulas.This would be difficult or even impossible to do with, say, a polynomial regression fit to new data points.The surrogate function — represented as a probability distribution, the prior — is updated with an ‘acquisition function’. This function is responsible for driving the proposition of new points to test, in an exploration and exploitation trade-off:Exploitation seeks to sample where the surrogate model predicts a good objective. This is taking advantage of known promising spots. However, if we have already explored a certain region enough, continually exploiting known information will yield little gain.Exploration seeks to sample in locations where the uncertainty is high. This ensures that no major region of the space is left unexplored — the global minima may happen to lie there.An acquisition function that encourages too much exploitation and too little exploration will lead to the model to reside only a minima it finds first (usually local — ‘going only where there is light’). An acquisition function that encourages the opposite will not stay in a minima, local or global, in the first place. Yielding good results in a delicate balance.The acquisition function, which we’ll denote a(x), must consider both exploitation and exploration. Common acquisition functions include expected improvement and maximum probability of improvement, all of which measure the probability a specific input may pay off in the future, given information about the prior (the Gaussian process).Let’s put the pieces together. Bayesian optimization can be performed as such:Initialize a Gaussian Process ‘surrogate function’ prior distribution.Choose several data points x such that the acquisition function a(x) operating on the current prior distribution is maximized.Evaluate the data points x in the objective cost function c(x) and obtain the results, y.Update the Gaussian Process prior distribution with the new data to produce a posterior (which will become the prior in the next step).Repeat steps 2–5 for several iterations.Interpret the current Gaussian Process distribution (which is very cheap to do) to find the global minima.Bayesian optimization is all about putting probabilistic ideas behind the idea of surrogate optimization. The combination of these two idea creates a powerful system with many applications, from pharmaceutical product development to autonomous vehicles.Most commonly in machine learning, however, Bayesian optimization is used for hyperparameter optimization. For instance, if we’re training a gradient boosting classifier, there are dozens of parameters, from the learning rate to the maximum depth to the minimum impurity split value. In this case, x represents the hyperparameters of the model, and c(x) represents the performance of the model, given hyperparameters x.The primary motivation for using Bayesian optimization is in scenarios where it is very expensive to evaluate the output. Firstly, an entire ensemble of trees needs to be built with the parameters, and secondly, they need to run through several predictions, which are expensive for ensembles.Arguably, neural network evaluation of the loss for a given set of parameters is faster: simply repeated matrix multiplication, which is very fast, especially on specialized hardware. This is one of the reasons gradient descent is used, which makes repeated queries to understand where it is going.In summary:Surrogate optimization uses a surrogate, or approximation, function to estimate the objective function through sampling.Bayesian optimization puts surrogate optimization in a probabilistic framework by representing surrogate functions as probability distributions, which can be updated in light of new information.Acquisition functions are used to evaluate the probability that exploring a certain point in space will yield a ‘good’ return given what is currently known from the prior, balancing exploration & exploitation.Use Bayesian optimization primarily when the objective function is expensive to evaluate, commonly used in hyperparameter tuning.

I recently came across this brilliant statement from him:A crucial difference between English and math curricula is that in English the books come first and the curriculum is then based on these, whereas in math, the curriculum comes first and then the books are based on that. In the first case, the books are essentially artistic; in the second case, the art is lost.Do these words resonate with you as they do with me?In British Columbia, the students headed to post-secondary mathematics take precalculus. The pre irks me. Twelve years of maths study and still in the pre stage. As if calculus is the real math.I would love to teach a high school maths class where I have full rein of the curriculum. When the students arrive, they see this on the board:That is my precalculus curriculum. Over the next several weeks, the students learn the notation. They learn about infinite series and partial sums. They learn the factorization of polynomials. Rational expressions. Trigonometry and the unit circle. Even complex numbers. These are all standards in a precalculus education.You may recognize the above as the famous Basel Problem. The curriculum I describe is necessary to understand Euler’s solution. The students finish the course with something to show for it. They are able to articulate a famous proof.Most importantly, the students get to play. They get to struggle with problems. They brainstorm together at the whiteboard.

Mathematical Induction: A Gentle Introduction,https://medium.com/mathadam/mathematical-induction-a-gentle-introduction-8290f6127447?source=tag_archive---------2-----------------------,"Math,Mathematics,Mathematics Education,Programming,Proofs","In a previous article, we used mathematical induction to prove the Binomial Theorem. That’s a lot to chew on if you are setting out to learn the technique. To see induction in action, we’ll apply it to a much simpler theorem.Then, to really chew on the implications of this proof technique, check out the Points to Ponder at the end of the article.You may have seen this before:Equation 1: A trick for summing the first n positive integers.The sum of the first n positive integers is equal to half the product of the numbers n and n+1.Not only may you be aware of this theorem, you may already know some charming demonstrations of its veracity. Releasing mathematical induction on this creature is like using a bazooka to kill a mosquito.But that’s the point. We want to focus on the inductive technique. And we can do that best with a less complicated example.The Base CaseIf you’re like me, the trivial example of n=1 is at once painful and satisfying. You could try the same for n=2, n=3 and so forth. Does it ever not work?InductionSuppose our observation holds for some general positive integer, k. This is our inductive hypothesis. Can we show that it must then hold for k+1? Proving this implication is our inductive step.The inductive hypothesis is the almost the same as the inductive step. In the latter, k is replace with k+1.We can add k+1 to both sides of the hypothesis statement:If the hypothesis is true, this statement must be true. Let’s expand the right-hand side:This is a quadratic. Factor out that pesky ½ to leave us with integer coefficients. Then factor the quadratic.But this is just the right-hand side of our inductive step. Thus, the inductive step follows directly from the inductive hypothesis.ConclusionWe’ve shown that if our theorem is true for some integer, k, then it has to be true the following integer, k+1. But it is true for the integer 1. So it must be true for 1+1. But if it’s true for 2, then it’s true for 2+1. And so forth.We haven’t demonstrated anything earth-shattering here. But we were able to focus on the whole process of induction.For practise, try this proof technique on a less obvious theorem:The sum of the cubes is equal to the square of the sums. Try this out. Is it always true?Point to PonderIf you are unable to complete the inductive step, does that prove that the theorem being tested is false? What if you show that the inductive step doesn’t follow from the hypothesis?MathAdamRavings of a quarantined mathematician.Follow6 Sign up for Ravings of a Quarantined MathematicianBy MathAdamA monthly-or-so-ish overview of recent mathy/fizzixy articles published by MathAdam.  Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

Solving Sudoku With AI or Quantum?,https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/solving-sudoku-with-ai-or-quantum-3421f5af7b54?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"Artificial Intelligence,Quantum Computing,Machine Learning,Mathematics,Quantum Physics","A little bit of history before diving deeper:Photo by John Morgan on Unsplash“History is called the mother of all subjects”, said Marc Bloch. So, let’s talk about how the famous Sudoku even came into existence. The story dates back to the late 19th Century and it originated from France. Le Siecle, a French daily published a 9x9 puzzle that required arithmetic calculations to solve rather than logic and had double-digit numbers instead of 1-to-9 with similar game properties like Sudoku where the digits across rows, columns, and diagonals if added, will result in the same number. In 1979 a retired architect and puzzler named Howard Garns is believed to be the creator behind the modern Sudoku which was first published by Dell Magazines in the name of Number Place. The puzzle was first published in the name Sudoku in 1986 by a Japanese puzzle company named Nikoli.Framing the Problems in solving a Sudoku:Sudoku is a real-world example of a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) as the variable set, domain set and the set of constraints are all finite. We must enter numbers ranging from 1–9 in a 9x9 table in such a manner that the numbers in every row, column, and in every 3x3 sub-table contains each number exactly once. There exists another variation of Sudoku too, which is Diagonal Sudoku with an extra set of constraints stating in each of the table diagonals each number must exactly be featured once. As we know about the constraint satisfaction domain the optimal solution must satisfy all the constraints or more specifically it should abide by the rules of the game. The optimal solution will satisfy all the constraints in the set thus will solve the puzzle.Computationally the constraints of solving a n x n sudoku can be solved in nondeterministic polynomial time (NP) as the constraints can be solved with some very specific brute-force algorithms and the validity of the set of solutions can be tested in polynomial time too where the inputs to the problem are associated with a set of solutions of polynomial length. A completely solved Sudoku is an example of a Latin Square (n x n array filled with n different symbols, as described by Euler). The Sudoku problem can be thought of as a graph coloring problem where we need to color the graph using only 9 colors and the exposed letters can be thought of as a partial color.Satisfying Constraints with Artificially Intelligent set of Algorithms:The founding principles of Computational Sciences stand on the ability to satisfy certain constraints with the help of logic. In the scenario of solving sudoku, we must train the solver to look for some specific match-winning patterns besides the basic rules. So, the thing is the system is not just following the rules blindly it is also taking some decisions keeping in mind its near and long-term effects. These patterns are called Heuristics. Similar to expert players who happen to know about some tips and tricks of the game, knowing only the basic rules doesn’t make them an expert in the game. So, while we develop the algorithms and solve our problems we must keep in mind the useful heuristics which we should also include in our program to make it smarter and more useful when it comes to winning.For our Sudoku Solver, we will take input the sequence of 81 numbers as a string and will represent unsolved numbers with ‘.’(period). To solve the problem we are going to do is replace the ‘.’ with all the probable numbers which can be placed into that cell.According to the constraints of the Sudoku, we cannot use a single digit more than once in a row, column, or in a 3x3 sub-square in the vicinity of any cell. In the case of Diagonal Sudoku, we must also take into consideration the same constraint. We start by replacing the period with all possible numbers from 1 to 9. We do this programmatically by using the following grid_values function.Assigning all possible values initially at all the unsolved cells.As we have now replaced the unsolved cells with all possible numbers from 1 to 9, we know from the basic rules of the Sudoku that we cannot use a number twice if it has already been used across that row, column and within the 3x3 sub-square of that cell. So, let us eliminate them if we encounter them at the unsolved grids which we have filled with all possible numbers initially. So let us take a look at how we can eliminate those irrelevant numbers from the unsolved cells using the eliminate python method.So, while satisfying these constraints we sometimes come across some cells where only a single digit can be placed, no other digit becomes viable for that specific cell except that digit. We fill in these at the very first of all. With their proper solution. We call this Only Choice, the easiest heuristic to solve a cell of a sudoku grid.In our journey so far around Constraint Satisfaction, there might come a situation where there will be two unsolved cells in a unit (considering row, column, and 3x3 sub-square) where only two specific remaining numbers can be assigned. So, these two numbers can be effectively removed from the possible numbers on other cells in the same unit. This heuristic is called the Naked Twins. The algorithm implementation specifically makes a deep copy of the grid values and checks for the naked twins' feasibility that is whether there are exactly two unsolved cells which can accept only two specific values and if it does it goes ahead and removes those two values from other cells in the same unit. We implement it programmatically by using the naked_twins function as written below:We now try to reduce the puzzle as much as possible by repeatedly applying these three constraint satisfaction algorithms and checking if it is stuck and cannot reduce any further. We do this programmatically by using the reduce_puzzle function. What we do is we call the previous three function inside a for loop and terminate it when the number of solved cells in both the input and the output sequence of the grid values are the same, which means that it cannot be reduced any further by only the constraint satisfaction algorithms alone.If the sudoku grid is still not solved with the constraint satisfaction problem, a partial solution will get to the output where a few of the cells will still be assigned to certain possible values. In these circumstances what we do is we use a search tree to search for the optimal set of digits in those places. We use Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm to traverse through the search tree. So basically with DFS we create up a few instances with the same grid and try out different possible assignments for each of the yet-unsolved cells. We recursively call for the CSP algorithms to reduce the grid based on the search results. We implement it programmatically as below:We use the display sudoku function to display the input string sequence as a two-dimensional 9x9 Sudoku grid:To solve a Sudoku Sequence we call the above functions like the following:The output looks like the following, where the set of algorithms have been successful in calculating the answer.Completely Solved Diagonal Sudoku.The Quantum Approach to Solving Sudoku as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem:We will now try to solve a simple Sudoku Grid with Quantum Simulated Annealing. First things first, what is the simulated annealing? The idea is for optimization problems like this we use some sub-optimal heuristics and obtain the optimal set of heuristics to obtain the optimal solution. We have used here the DWave AQC Model (Adiabetic Quantum Computing) to sample out the optimal solution which satisfies the constraints discussed earlier.Using the DWave Kerberos Hybrid Sampler:We are in this example working with the hybrid solver provided with DWave. It finds out the optimal set of heuristics by running a parallel tabu search. It’s a hybrid solver as it uses both quantum and the classical properties of computation underneath. It is also a decomposition sampler that uses an asynchronous workflow while processing. It’s included in the Ocean SDK package of the DWave Systems. To get started with the development locally make sure you have Python 3.5+ installed on your system and issue the following command.python -m pip install --upgrade pippip install dwave-ocean-sdkUsing Binary Quadratic Models (BQM) for the calculations:We cannot frame the constraints directly ready to be fed to the Quantum Computers, we need an intermediate representation for it to be getting fed. That’s why we will use BQM, fortunately, DWave Ocean SDK already provides a tool called combinations which can be used to frame Constraint Satisfaction Problems into BQMs. Firstly Binary Quadratic Models as the name itself suggests is a system of the equation which is quadratic and is expressed in Binary. Due to higher complexities in calculations, Quantum computers use these to significantly speed up the development process. So, back in the game we were we have decided to use the combinations tool from dimod which is going to return a Binary Quadratic Model which is minimized for each of the k-combinations of its input and internal variables.We start by importing necessary packages from the dwave-ocean-sdk and do some sanity check before actually reading into the Sudoku Grid.We now go ahead and create up the Binary Quadratic Models using combinations tools from all the available variable combinations of the Sudoku Grid’s rows, columns, and sub-square indices.So, that is it. We have successfully implemented two intelligent solutions one of which uses classical Computation and uses Artificially Intelligent Heuristic, really powerful, and can solve even diagonal sudoku grids. The second one uses an Asynchronous hybrid heuristic sampler which also happens to use state of the art Simulated Annealing of the Adiabatic Quantum Computing model to perform a conversion of the Constraint satisfaction problem to a Binary Quadratic Model to perform sampling over it and thereby obtaining the optimal solution.I am earnestly grateful to you for your time.“Even the greatest fool can accomplish a task if it were after his or her heart. But the intelligent ones are those who can convert every work into one that suits their taste.” — Swami Vivekananda.Towards AIThe Best of Tech, Science, and Engineering.Follow243 Sign up for Towards AI NewsletterBy Towards AITowards AI publishes the best of tech, science, and engineering.

Read this blog before you think you know divisibility completely !,https://medium.com/@kowshikchilamkurthy/read-this-blog-before-you-think-you-know-divisibility-completely-6f7d5bf8d21c?source=tag_archive---------4-----------------------,"Math,Mathematics,Numbers,Number Theory","Photo by Markus Spiske on UnsplashThe intention to write this blog is not to dwell too much upon the theories. I don’t plan to confuse reader’s minds providing useless proofs to obvious things. My main motivation is to put these amazing concepts the way I’d like to teach my young-self.Introductionlet me quickly discuss divisibility and GCD(greatest common divisor) and also introduce few notations here:Divisibility: An integer b is divisible by a integer a, not zero, if there is an integer x such that b=ax, and we write a|b.GCD: The greatest common divisor (gcd) of two or more integers, which are not all zero, is the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers.For two integers a, b, the greatest common divisor of a and b is denoted (a,b)What GCD Hide From You ?I will introduce the concept which I liked the most about GCD. Believe me, you might not believe that these concepts are truly generalised till you see a proper mathematical proof ( which I will provide 😉).Wait! but it can just be another coincidence right?Not really what you just saw is truly generalised and magnificent result.Greatest common divisor of b and c is the least positive value of bx+cy where x,y range all over integers.ProofLets carryout the proof in two steps. In the first step, we prove that the least positive number l that obtained from b𝔁+ c𝒚 ∀ 𝔁,𝒚 ɛ𝐼 is divisible by b,c. In the second step we prove that l is GCD of b,c i.e l = (b,c)Step 1. l|b and l|cStep 2. l = (b,c)ObservationsSome Extraordinary Outcomes of the Result !1. (a, b ) = ( a, b+a𝔁) for any integer 𝔁2. GCD (n! + 1 , (n+1)!+1) = 1Few Examples !ConclusionUnderstanding numbers has always been a perpetual pursuit for not just mathematicians but also for many eager minds. This blog is just an selfless and decent attempt to shed some light on the most original concepts in everyday topic like divisibility. The concepts which are introduced to the readers in this blog are generalised and provable, but there many concepts which are waiting to get discovered.Suggestions are most welcome.

But there was not zero and its applications.Brahmi lipi was used widely to write Sanskrit slokas in ancient India. If you see number system in the Brahmi lipi. Here it is…There were number system in existence much before in all civilisations including India. But there was not zero and its applications.Now, if you want to write 9 in brahmi number you have to write the symbol of ten in ten digit and the symbol of one in unit digit.Here is the number system and it’s representation in Sarada Lipi. (Zero was added in this because it Sarada Lipi was developed in 3rd century.) Similar for Devanagari script which is popularly used to write Hindi and Sanskrit.Aryabhatta invented zero that means he thought that some number like zero exists and one can represent Ten as Symbol of one as ten digit and Symbol of zero as unit digit. This was firstly added in Bakhshali Manuscript and then it was added in other Lipis.Brahmagupta also deserves some credit for invention of zero. Later on Sridharacharya invented the operations of zero in India in 8th century.He clearly mentioned the properties of Zero.“If zero is added to any number, the sum is the same number; if zero is subtracted from any number, the number remains unchanged; if zero is multiplied by any number, the product is zero”.So, the conclusion is the zero was invented later than number system. The number system was existed much before and zero was not part of number system then.Written byPooja KomakulaUndergraduate (coding) | Writer | Web Developer | Passionate Learner |FollowMathematicsHinduismIndiaKnowledgeHistoryMore from Pooja KomakulaFollowUndergraduate (coding) | Writer | Web Developer | Passionate Learner |More From MediumThe Geometric Chaos, Sierpinski TriangleWaldo Otis in However, MathematicsExplaining the Josephus AlgorithmRobert R.F.

Thoughts about flux,https://medium.com/@fnap/thoughts-about-flux-2505073cca6d?source=tag_archive---------6-----------------------,"Physics,Mathematics,Flux,Integral Calculus","Born with mathematicians but accepted with love by physics, the concept of flux is something that really staggered me when i was first introduced in my late calculus classes. Besides being angry about not knowing how to solve integrals and many algebraic manipulations that made me think twice if i really should be studying engineering, these classes created on me a authentic interest in the flux idea; i don’t know why, i was just fascinated by it and whenever it came up again in further exercises or topics it always made my eyes shine.Ok, but, what actually is the flux? Well, i love to start it simple so, imagine this: You are married, and everytime you and your partner have dinner, both of you discuss about who should wash the dishes. Because you are a lovely husband/wife you say: “go on honey, i can take this, i have a plan”. You get your plates, goes to the sink and opens the tap as wide as possible so the water comes fast and in a huge amount. All you have to do is put your plates in the waterpath and voilà, the dishes are clean and you barely touched any waste. The plan goes well until when the month ends and your water bill gets way more expensive than usual! Why is that? Well, because of the flux!!!The flux is the amount of *something* that goes through any surface, in this specific case, the water going through the tap hole, which is a circle, or any other format if you have a fancy tap, mines are circles. Easy right? But let me show you with a beautiful drawing:Flux of water through the tap.The first situation is a low flux situation, where you openned the tap just a little bit. The second one is a normal situation and the last one is what happens if someone has a fancy plan like yours. A lot more of water comes through that tap hole and that is why your bill is so expansiveç oh you’re so naive, aren’t you?This conclusion is trivial and sort of intuitive, right? If you put a bucket bellow it, the more water goes through the tap hole the more you will have after a certain period of time, this is determined by this relation on the left and is easy to deduce, but let’s try to think about it from another point of view. Let’s get that same circle area from the tap where the water passes through and divide it in small subsections. Now we have that hole circle area defined by lots of lots small squares. But one might say: “What about the borders? We can’t fit squares around there”, and you’re right my friend; doesn’t matter how may small little squares you have in this circle, you will never reach the entire area because in the borders you can’t have perfect squares. Unless you have infinite squares, that’s right. In mathematics this abstraction is used to calculate, amogst other things, areas in term of small pieces, like squares, this concept is called integralization!To do it, a lot of steps needs to be taken, but to make it simple, i will divide the requirements in only two:The direction of the flux relative to the surfaceIn our example, the water comes straight from the top with a 90 degree angle relative to the circle surface, so the water that comes in is exactly the water that comes out given a period of time. But, to use a mathematical rule we can’t only depend on straight sharp angles, we need to generalize it for any angle that the water(or anything else we want to measure) comes, that’s why we need a normal vector (n), which can be interpreted as a baseline from where the flux(j) can vary upon. Then we can compare how close is the flux vector relative to the normal vector, and it will aways be proportional to cosθ.Generalization of the flux in the circle.2. Sum of the flux in all infinite squaresHaving the flux vector j, we need to consider infinite vectors, one for each little square inside the circle. Each one of them represents the individual flux of the infinitesimal squares, adding them all up will give us the total flux of the circle area. That can be matematically discribed as:Sum of all flux vectors in all infinitesimal squares.ConclusionThis expression determined above can be a little strange if you missed your calculus classes (or if you are from a different field of study 😛) but it represents a lot of concepts in math and even in physics like current, eletric field, heat transfer, etc. It makes easy a lot of calculations that otherwise would be bothersome and difficult. Not only through math expressions but the flux intuitive concept is something that occurs often and visualizing it may open your mind to inner perspectives about the world around us.Written byFelipe NunesFollowPhysicsMathematicsFluxIntegral CalculusMore from Felipe NunesFollowMore From MediumValid Perfect Square: An Application of Binary Search AlgorithmMukitul Islam Ratul in The StartupTen is the Holiest NumberSteven Rosa in Cantor’s ParadiseMath behind Naive-Bayes SimplifiedArun PoochelvanIs correlation distance a metric?Alireza Modirshanechi in The StartupWhat Do You Expect the Mean to be equal to?Richard MeiHow They Estimated the Distance to The MoonWojciech Wieczorek in Cantor’s ParadiseGraphing Erdős and BaconMichael Carlisle in Cantor’s ParadiseHow to Be Happy (According to 300-Year-Old Maths)Sam Enright in The StartupAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Book Review: The Math(s) Fix — Part 1 of 2,https://medium.com/@ziadmbaroudi/book-review-the-math-s-fix-part-1-of-2-c822a4c137d6?source=tag_archive---------7-----------------------,"Mathematics,Math,Mathematics Education,Curriculum","The Math(s) Fix is Conrad Wolfram’s case for teaching mathematics with the assumption that computers exist! To be clear from the beginning, Wolfram is not advocating that we solve the same problems but with a greater reliance on computers and calculators. He wants us to recognise that computers have revolutionised the discipline of mathematics and that we need to reflect this change in our curricula.Do we need a new subject?Throughout the book, Wolfram makes the case for a “computer-based core computational subject”. This would be a new, compulsory, mathematics subject. Today’s curricula are stuck in the past. They emphasise computation: Long division, solving of quadratic equations and integral calculations by hand. We may use calculators to carry out these operations on occasion but the curriculum is built around these skills.In the real world, computers carry out these, um, computations! This doesn’t mean that computers have replaced mathematicians. This means that the role of a mathematician is no longer what it used to be.Anyone for a course in photography?Wolfram says that, until recently, a course in photography would have to include film processing. In fact, it would start with the essential skill of loading a film into the camera. Digital photography has shown us that this skill was incidental to the technology of the day, not something essential to the art itself.Similarly, what we continue to consider as the essence of mathematics is a collection of skills that were appropriate before the advent of the digital computer.Our author is afraid that the subject of mathematics, unless updated, will go the way of latin in British schools!Why make it compulsory?Wolfram takes great pain to justify the compulsory nature of mathematics. Apart from its applicability to new jobs, citizens who lack an understanding of algorithms or of the basics of data science, such as the difference between correlation and causation, will be disenfranchised in modern society.The problem in one paragraphThe following paragraph, while perhaps a little badly written, summarises what is wrong with today’s mathematics curricula. Note that I do endorse this diagnosis:The mechanics of inverting matrices, but not the use of machine learning. Sketching graphs of functions, but not the ability to construct models from observations of the real world. Calculation of statistics by hand, but not the filtering of large datasets to extract relevant information to process (p. 119).The process to rule them all!Sorry, I couldn’t help it. Wolfram proposes a 4-part process for computational thinking:I will summarise my understanding of each of these 4 steps with an emphasis on the second and fourth, only because they may be the least obvious ones.DefineReal-world problems are open-ended in their very nature. The student needs to be trained in defining the question they want to answer precisely and to consider any constraints on their solution.Abstract (to computable form)Translate the problem into a language conducive to computational solutions. While Wolfram does not specify such a language at this stage of his book, I would think that he had something like “pseudocode” in mind. Pseudocode is a way of writing algorithms so that they can then be implemented in various programming languages.The abstraction should address the general case of the problem rather than one specific instance of it.In today’s maths, the students calculates the highest common factor, HCF (or greatest common divisor, GCD) of two specific integers, say 18 and 48. If we required a higher level of abstraction, the student would write an algorithm that is capable of finding the HCF of any two integers.ComputeIn this step, you actually find the answer to the question you specified in step 1. This step should be done by computer!InterpretThis is where you ask yourself a question like: “Does the answer make sense in this context?” If you teach mathematics, you may agree that this is a necessary but often neglected question. I have seen students satisfied after discounting an item by 15% and obtaining a price that is less than half of the original one!Similarly, if you have just calculated the correlation between two variables, you may want to ask: “What does this tell me about the relationship between them?”ConclusionI do believe that Conrad Wolfram makes a good point about the need for a new maths curriculum. There is much in the first half of the book that I wish I had room to summarise here. The main point is that the book is intended as “an education blueprint for the AI age.” For this reason, I hope that many maths teachers and school leaders take a look at it.In the next instalment, I will talk more about the proposed new curriculum, what the author has termed a computer-based computational subject. I have a few disagreements with him on that part of the book, while still sharing his overarching view.Originally published at http://www.ramblingteacher.com on September 12, 2020.Written byZiad M BaroudiI am a Maths and Digital Technologies teacher in Melbourne, Australia.FollowMathematicsMathMathematics EducationCurriculumMore from Ziad M BaroudiFollowI am a Maths and Digital Technologies teacher in Melbourne, Australia.More From MediumRandom mental math tricks (Part 2): Special MultiplicationsTyson WuHelp Engineers Grasp Statistics by Writing CodeCourse Hero in The StartupModeling Linear Population Growth with Matrices.DDSimms in The StartupThe Fundamental Theorem of CalculusMaths and Musings in Cantor’s ParadiseThis Word Problem Shows That Words Are a Problem, Not MathKwame Afriyie Osei-TutuPolynomials — Division by Vision with Remainders (Part B)Greg OliverMeet Our Writers — Francesco Di LalloCantor’s Paradise Team in Cantor’s ParadiseExploring the geometric ratios in Rick’s paradoxJoaquin de Castro in Cantor’s ParadiseAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Understanding Euclid: A Simplified Approach to Mathematical Thinking,https://medium.com/however-mathematics/understanding-euclid-a-simplified-approach-to-mathematical-thinking-625010bec030?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Mathematics,Geometry,Education,Logic,Philosophy","A series of of ongoing illustrations inspired by the Elements of Euclid by Chris ThompsonI remember that my mathematical education has started with numbers. First, my father, then later, my elementary teacher, taught me how to count as my elementary math education. However, 2400 years ago, everything was utterly different, and kids were taught geometry first.Before Jesus, geometry was more important than numbers. For instance, when the founder of the first institution of higher education in the Western world, Plato, came back to Athens, he decided to found the “Academy” where it would be the intellectual center of the world (Wikipedia, “Plato”). For that purpose, instead of taking a nonrefundable application fee, he engraved “ΑΓΕΩΜΕΤΡΗΤΟΣ ΜΗΔΕΙΣ ΕΙΣΙΤΩ” (Translated from Greek as “Let no man ignorant of geometry enter here”) at the door of his academy to eliminate those who were opposed. Plato’s idea of the ideal world had a strong connection with beauty and intelligence, which were both well taught in mathematics. Later, a young man, Euclid of Alexandria, entered that door and became a mathematician and philosopher, and wrote a geometry book, The Elements, which went on to be the most famous textbook of all time and the most widely printed text after the Holy Bible and the Holy Quran (History of Information, “Euclid’s Elements”).The Elements was so influential because it contained a comprehensive collection of important works in mathematics up until Euclid’s time (College of Education, “Eudoxus’ Influence on Euclid’s Elements”). Most of Euclid’s ideas came as revelations and laid the foundation for Euclidean Geometry. These ideas became the core of the teaching and understanding of geometry from over two thousand years up until today. For a long time, you were not viewed as educated if you had not read The Elements. Even today, when you read The Elements, it contains modern theories that remain relevant even today, which makes it extraordinary.Oliver Byrne: The First Six Books of the Elements of EuclidEuclid lived about 300 years before Christ. He was an adept example for those interested in mathematics. After his death, his ideas and published works that he produced became a converging point for genius minds. Learned persons were going to read his books to discover the power of their intellect even if they weren’t mathematicians.For instance, more than 2,000 years after it was first written, Abraham Lincoln was reading Euclid’s Elements by lamplight to enhance his reasoning after everyone had gone to bed at the dormitory (Wikipedia, “Euclid’s Elements”). When he became president, he was still reading the same book to deduce its logic and give the right political decision while he was governing America.Similarly, novelist and philosopher Fyodor Dostoyevsky mentioned Euclid in his book, The Brothers Karamazov[highlighted below]:The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, pg. 203And a century after that, one of the greatest minds of all time, Albert Einstein, gave an even stronger endorsement to Euclid and his book in his essay On The Method of Theoretical Physics [highlighted below]:Contributions to Science by Albert Einstein, pg. 271 Source: University of PittsburghIn Bertrand Russell (1872–1970) words, an elite philosopher of our time, we find a clear and concise assessment of Euclid: “Euclid’s Elements is certainly one of the greatest books ever written and one of the perfect monuments of the Greek intellect.” He also says in his autobiography: “At the age of eleven, I began Euclid, with my brother as my tutor. This was one of the great events of my life, as dazzling as first love. I had not imagined that there was anything so delicious in the world.”History of Western Philosophy by Bertrand Russell, pg.228, | The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell: 1872–1914, pg. 36Euclid was different from other people. We know almost nothing about his personal life, family, and non-mathematics curiosity; however, the one thing that we do know was that he was one of the most respected teachers of his time in the city of Alexandria. While others were working to afford food and shelter, Euclid was dealing with abstract ideas. He wasn’t interested in building and creating cities as much as he was in mathematical concepts. He realized that society was changing, and people needed a logical way of thinking to rule cities. That’s why this era saw a surge in theoretical ideas of mathematics.He was a wandering man who freed himself from trivial problems, who discovered the truths that we can confirm today with satellite photographs, as he was sitting by the sea pondering the questions about the world we live in. He started his journey with nothing but a straightedge and a compass. These were the only tools that Euclid used for the whole of The Elements. First, he used his tools to draw two points and a line, from which he derived lots more exciting stuff for us to learn from. If we define mathematics as an intellectual journey, Euclid’s ideas are definitely the first steps. The view from Euclid’s window was a revolution that would be extended into space.Indeed, in Euclid’s eyes, mathematics was so crucial because it is purely truth-oriented, and it has the beauty of art and value of abstract thought. His mathematical approach still stands as a perfect model of reasoning. He did something special that had not been done before. We may say his works were the beginning of the consideration of mathematics as an analytic deductive subject. He taught us a valuable lesson; that when we feel something intuitively is true, we need to prove that it is always true for everyone. He showed us the power of proof and a logical path that help us find universal truths. He turned mathematics into a subject that proves things with a hundred percent certainty and can be applied in diverse situations.When you read Euclid’s Elements, you will notice that Euclid’s mathematical approach is unique and straightforward. He starts with basic assumptions such as if this is true, then this must be true, or if this is wrong, then the opposite of it has to be true. Then he either proves or disproves his assumptions, and concludes by writing the results as a theorem. What is important here is that Euclid chose to go for universality. He didn’t find temporary solutions for specific issues. He made a remarkable change and made the solutions universally applicable.Let’s take a look at Euclid’s proof about prime numbers. There’s nothing particularly striking about prime numbers other than the fact that there are infinitely many of them. We are not 100% sure but have reason to believe that Euclid was the first human to prove there are infinitely many primes. His proof was also, most probably, the first proof ever in mathematics. However, it is essential to mention that Euclid never explicitly wrote, “there are infinitely many primes”; instead, he wrote: “prime numbers are more than any assigned multitude of prime numbers” (Clark University Mathematics, “Proposition 20”). The reason for this strange wording was since the idea of infinity was different than it was today and was a developing concept. [Translate from book IX]I’m sure you’ve all come across prime numbers. Before giving Euclid’s unique proof, we should talk about prime numbers a little because the definitions are important parts of understanding mathematics. So, what is a prime number?Definition: A prime number is a whole number bigger than one that’s divisible only by 1 and itself.The number 1 is an exception to this rule. Although 1 satisfies all the conditions to be prime, we don’t assume that it is a prime number for a good reason. It is because mathematicians need to make practical definitions. If one is considered a prime number, you encounter a problem when you apply a prime factorization for any number. For instance, if you do prime factorization for 15, you need to write:18=2x3x3x1x1x1x1x1x1x1x1x1x1x1x1x1x1x1… .I think this is a good enough reason to say one is not prime.The first prime numbers.When Euclid discovered these intriguing numbers, he researched them and decided to reveal some mysteries. To begin with, he wrote the first few prime numbers on a parchment paper. For the sake of example, let’s say he wrote up to 100. Then he started looking for patterns because all mathematicians are interested in patterns. For instance, he saw that 2 is the only even prime number because all other even numbers larger than two were divisible by 2. Likewise, 3 was a prime number, but multiples of 3 couldn’t be prime because he could divide them by 3.Then he asked himself: “If I continue writing, will I ever stop?” He hoped to have infinitely many prime numbers because otherwise, life would be tedious for him or any other mathematician after him. It was a very challenging question because he had to painstakingly check each number to see whether it was prime or not. There were no computers to do the calculations for him. Yes, it is quite easy to calculate whether 13 is prime or not, but each digit would take days or weeks after a certain point. Even if we had the chance to donate the most powerful computer in the world to Euclid’s institution, it still wouldn’t be enough to quell his curiosity. The computer could find a vast prime number, but we yet wouldn’t know whether that’s the biggest prime number. So, asking a computer to find big primes for us will never resolve the question of the biggest prime number.Euclid had found numerous truths just by using the mathematics of his time. Since believing something was not enough to convince people, he had to look for perfect certainty one more time. Only then could Euclid could approach a mathematical way to do it. He just needed a brilliant idea and ended up with an elegant proof. That’s why he defined a theorem at first.Theorem: Prime numbers are more than any assigned multitude of prime numbers.he proof was of great significance to Euclid because his theorem needed to be sound. He planned to use a thought experiment, which is a mathematical technique called proof by contradiction. First, he imagined that he lived in a parallel universe where there are finitely many prime numbers. Thus, he could write them on a list. It might be a very long list, but prime numbers are finite in his universe. He didn’t know the largest prime exactly, so he called it “p.” He got a huge piece of paper and wrote all the primes in the world. His list started from 2, 3, 5, 7 to up to “p,” which is [theoretically] the largest prime number. Euclid then came up with a fantastic idea: “I will multiply all those numbers together and add 1”.He didn’t know what that number was, but it was a product of all the primes in his new world plus 1. He already knew that that number had to have a prime factor because every number bigger than 1 has to have a prime factor. [The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic] There remains the possibility that this number was itself prime.The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic: Every integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes in an essentially unique way.In other words, they are the building blocks from which all numbers are made. Teachers like to say, ""Primes are the atoms of mathematics.""So, Euclid needed to check. Could that prime factor be 2? The answer was no because that number was two times some other number plus 1. So it had to leave the remainder 1. Could that prime factor be 3? The answer was no again because that number is three times some other numbers plus 1, and it leaves a remainder of 1. Could that prime factor be 5? No, because that number is five times some other numbers plus 1, it leaves a remainder of 1. For each prime, the same thing was going to happen.Euclid’s act of genius made his new number always indivisible by any of the primes on his list. Euclid’s number still left a remainder of 1 when he divided by any of the prime numbers he found. However, that number had to have a prime factor, as mentioned earlier. Thus, his logical argument reached an absurdity that this cannot happen. There was a contradiction in his parallel universe that cannot exist- there must be infinitely many primes.What Euclid did a long ago was so beautiful because our finite mind could reach infinity with this approach. He expanded our horizons of knowledge. As I said above earlier, the view from Euclid’s window was a revolution that would be extended into space. For us, the possibilities of expanding the mathematical frontier should be thrilling.However, MathematicsLife is good for only two things, discovering mathematics…Follow424 1 MathematicsGeometryEducationLogicPhilosophy424 claps424 claps1 responseWritten byAliFollowMath Teacher.

Matrix Multiplication and the Ingenious Strassen’s Algorithm,https://medium.com/cantors-paradise/matrix-multiplication-and-the-ingenious-strassens-algorithm-cd1a439030e0?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Algorithms,Mathematics,Discrete Mathematics,Education,Science","IntroductionSuppose that you have two real n x n matrices A and B, and you want to compute the n x n matrix C = AB that is the product of A and B. By definition, if we denote by a(i,j) the element of matrix A that is in the i-th row and j-th column, and, similarly for B and C, we have that the element c(i,j) of C is equal toIt is natural to ask now about the time needed to compute matrix C. By observing the above definition, one can immediately come up with the following straightforward algorithm, which we describe in pseudo-code.INPUT: n x n matrices A and BOUTPUT: the n x n product matrix C = ABfor i = 1,...,n:    for j = 1,...,n:        c(i,j) = 0;        for t = 1,...,n:            c(i,j) = c(i,j) + a(i,t) b(t,j);return C;If we assume, for simplicity, that additions, multiplications and memory access take constant time, then it is easy to see that the above algorithm does roughly n³ steps, as we have 3 for-loops, each one nested inside the others. In other words, its time complexity is Θ(n³).The above discussion already shows that there exist polynomial-time algorithms for computing the product of two matrices. Nevertheless, given that the product of matrices is an operation that occurs very often in practice, one might ask about whether there are faster algorithms that compute the product.To this day, pinpointing the exact time complexity of Matrix Multiplication is one of the major open questions of Theoretical Computer Science.Volker Strassen in 2009. [Source: Wikipedia]In this article, we will discuss the first algorithm that broke the O(n³) barrier. Named after its creator, Volker Strassen, Strassen’s algorithm, which appeared in 1969, uses the Divide-And-Conquer technique in a very clever way that results in an improved running time.Strassen’s algorithmTo simplify the exposition, we will assume throughout that n = 2ᵏ for some positive integer number k. We note that this is without loss of generality, as we can always add extra all-zero lines and rows (padding) in the matrices A and B, such that the value of n is an integer power of 2, and moreover this new value of n is within a factor of 2 (i.e., within a constant factor) from the original value of n. In other words, this does not cause significant blow-up in the input size.As a warm-up, we first devise a Divide-And-Conquer algorithm for Matrix Multiplication whose running time is still Θ(n³). The ideas contained in this algorithm will prove useful for presenting Strassen’s algorithm.So, let’s start by writing the matrices A, B and C as block matrices, as follows.The dimension of each of the sub-matrices in the above block decomposition is (n/2) x (n/2); this is why assuming that n is a power of 2 is convenient.It is now easy to see that the following equations hold.The above equations suggest a very simple recursive algorithm. We can recursively call our algorithm to compute all 8 products of matrices of size (n/2) x (n/2) that appear in the four equations, and then, in time O(n²), we can add everything together and compute the final matrix C. The running time T(n) of such a recursive algorithm satisfiesT(n) = 8 T(n/2) + O(n²).By applying the Master Theorem, we conclude that the running time of this recursive algorithm is T(n) = O(n³). Thus, no progress was made.Having the above as a starting point, Strassen then tried to reduce the number of recursive calls made. And he succeeded! He managed to reduce the number of recursive calls from 8 to 7. Thus, he ended up with a recursive algorithm whose running time S(n) satisfiesS(n) = 7 S(n/2) + O(n²).The Master Theorem now implies thatStrassen’s trickStrassen made the following observation. He defined the following matricesThese matrices might look like they came out of the blue, but some reverse engineering and playing around with the expressions defining the 4 blocks of C, along with Strassen’s ingenuity, led to these definitions. A crucial observation is that each of the matrices M₁, …, M₇ can be computed with exactly one recursive call, as the remaining operations are additions. Thus, it already seems that 7 recursive calls might be enough. To finish his proof, Strassen then showed that the following equations hold.It is easy to verify the above equations; here we will only verify that the second equation is true, and the rest is left as an exercise to the reader.Note that there is a constant number of matrix additions that we need to do, and so the total number of steps besides the recursive calls O(n²). Thus, we indeed get that the total running time S(n) satisfiesS(n) = 7 S(n/2) + O(n²).We are done!ConclusionStrassen’s algorithm was a major breakthrough and was the starting point of a long line of research that is still ongoing to this day. The big open question is whether there exists a Matrix Multiplication algorithm with running time O(n²). Since the input and output have size n², this is clearly a lower bound, and one cannot hope to go lower than that. Given the significance of the problem, the constant in the exponent of the best (optimal) Matrix Multiplication algorithm is denoted as ω. From the discussion in this article, we already have that2 ≤ ω ≤ 2.8074.In fact, the current state-of-the-art algorithm for Matrix Multiplication by Francois Le Gall shows thatω < 2.3729.A nice graph that shows this beautiful line of research that Strassen started is given below.The improvements in ω during the last 5 decades.

A Fascinating Prisoner’s Puzzle,https://medium.com/cantors-paradise/a-fascinating-prisoners-puzzle-be874032f43e?source=tag_archive---------2-----------------------,"Mathematics,Puzzle,Education,Programming,Chess","Diagram 1: A Chess Board where a key is placed in a secret compartment in one square. For the purposes of this article, we’ll be assuming the 3rd column of the 2nd row.IntroductionThis article flows out of a video conversation between the YouTubers and mathematicians Grant Sanderson and Matt Parker (references below) and an email conversation between myself and a friend of mine: Peter Gaffney as we explored our own solutions to this beguiling puzzle.Exploring different approaches to this seemingly impossible problem reveals some interesting connections between various branches of mathematics including logic, set theory, multidimensional vector spaces and even category theory.Outline of the PuzzleYou and a fellow prisoner are imprisoned in a dungeon and are facing execution. As is usual in these problems, the prison warden has both a love of recreational mathematics and an unusual amount of judicial latitude when it comes to deciding your fate. They want to give you and your cellmate a chance of freedom but don’t want to make it too easy for you.They have a chessboard where each square is covered by a coin — either heads or tails. Moreover it’s a special chess board with a hidden compartment in each square. A single one of these squares contains a symbolic key to the jail and freedom for you and your cell companion. You will know which square contains the key and your fellow prisoner has to guess.The rules are as follows:(1) You and your cellmate can discuss how to encode a message using the chessboard but the prison warden can hear and understand everything that you say.(2) Once you have decided on a system, your companion leaves the room.(3) You observe the prison warden hiding the key in one square and then arranging the 64 coins as heads or tails however they deem fit — presumably trying to frustrate your system.(4) You then turn over exactly one coin on the chess board and leave the room.(5) Your companion re-enters the room, without having any opportunity to see or communicate with you. He observes the chessboard and the arrangement of coins and points to the square where he believes the key and freedom reside.(6) Nothing sneaky is allowed on pain of immediate death i.e. This is a pure logic problem- there is no meta game. Paper and Pencil, calculator and plenty of time are available to you and your cellmate if necessary.In order to make our diagrams easier to understand, we’ll use dark and light counters to represent heads and tails and limit ourselves to a 4 x 4 chessboard with 2⁴=16 squares. However everything we discover will apply equally well to a standard chess board with 2⁶=64 squares or even far larger chessboards provided the total number of squares is a power of two.Diagram 2: The chessboard from Diagram 1, now covered in counters after the secret compartment has been closedSome Properties of the ProblemThe prisoner warden gets to set all the coins on the board and we only get to flip one to convey our message- a tiny signal in all that noise. At first glance this seems completely impossible but let’s start by understanding what is relevant in our puzzle and what we can discard. Then we’ll see if we can start with a simpler version of the problem.For starters, the geometry of the chessboard is irrelevant, because we are not dealing with chess moves or anything else that would make the relationship of squares to each other important. The squares could all be in a row, in a four dimensional 2x2x2x2 hypercube or any other configuration. Additionally the order of squares doesn't matter as long as we keep track.In some sense, the chessboard must encode the 4 bits of information required to specify the row and column of the key square. Given that the prison warden will have chosen a configuration either at random or maliciously, some or all the bits encoded may be wrong. So it must be possible to choose a coin to flip (represented here by the counter changing color) that will fix the wrong bits without impacting the correct ones. In the case where the chessboard already encodes 4 correct bits, there must be at least one square that has no effect on the 4 bits when its coin is flipped.A single square chess board (1 = 2⁰) has no information to transfer because the key can only be in that square. The first non trivial case is two squares (2 = 2¹). We will start with this and generalize using 4 distinct approaches to get to a solution.Diagram 3: The simplest non trivial case of 2 squares.Fell free to take a pause before continuing. It’s a fun problem that is very rewarding to mull over.Let’s start by solving the two square case which, based on the hints above, is relatively simple. We need one square that does nothing when we flip its coin (aka change its counter )- let’s choose the one on the left. This means that the right square needs to encode the location of the key. Let’s choose light for left and dark for right. When the warden has finished with the board, if the right-hand coin indicates the incorrect square for the key, we flip it. However if it is already correct, we flip the left-hand coin which has no effect on our key location message.Now we’re ready to scale up to bigger boards and consider various approaches. These approaches can be read separately if you want to dip in and out of this article.Approach A: HypercubeLet’s imagine our squares to be arranged into a 2x2x2x2 tesseract — a 4 dimensional hypercube of side length 2.If we consider each dimension separately, we will have 4 separate pairs of squares and we already know how to solve a single pair of squares. However we do have an issue as we no longer have single coins for each square. Each square has behind it a collection of 2³=8 coins, one for every possible combination of the other dimensions. Somehow we need to be able to aggregate all these to produce a single virtual “coin” on the right representing that dimension. A single coin is an odd number which suggests the possibility that we regard the virtual “coin” as dark if there is an odd number of dark coins in this collection of 8 and light otherwise- this is often called parity. To make this clearer, let’s temporarily drop to 2 dimensions and show the parity coins that are aggregated from a collection of two coins in this case, as shown in Diagram 4.Diagram 4: A 2x2 chessboard with the parity “coins” worked out.We can change from odd to even for our dimension or visa versa by flipping either of the 2 coins. Even nicer, the dimensions are of course independent. There is a coin for every single combination of dimension coordinates. So we can work out the coordinate of the coin to flip (left or right) separately for each dimension. If the current parity coin for a dimension Dₓ does not indicate the location of the key in that dimension, we can change the parity by flipping a coin that is on the right for that dimension: Dₓ=R. If the parity already indicates the location of the key in that dimension, then we flip a coin on the left: Dₓ=L. When we have done this for all available dimensions, we will have unique coordinates for the coin to flip.So we have a way to solve a 2x2 square or indeed our 2x2x2x2 hypercube. But how to we map the chessboard squares onto this hypercube? One approach is to drop down to a single dimension first, as in Diagram 5.Diagram 5: Making a chessboard one dimensionalWe can then use the algorithm that many programming languages use for implementing a multi-dimensional array in a linear address space. This involves a form of recursive nesting which should be fairly obvious from Diagram 6.Diagram 6: Allocating a multi-dimensional array as a line.Putting all this together, we get the labeling shown in Diagram 7.Diagram 7: 4 Dimensional Labeling for our chessboard with the location of the key markedNow we can produce the virtual coins for each dimension Dₓ by working out the parity of each collection of 8 coins where Dₓ=R as shown in Diagram 8.Diagram 8: Calculating the parity for each dimension in the hypercubeThe board currently codes for the position: D₀=R, D₁=L, D₂=R, D₃=R. We want it to code for the position: D₀=L, D₁=R, D₂=R, D₃=L. D₀, D₁ and D₃ are incorrect. We indicate a change with R and can leave the parity of a dimension alone with L so we can fix the position encoded by the board by flipping the coin at D₀=R, D₁=R, D₂=L, D₃=R.Approach B: BinaryLet’s consider our board again but label our rows and columns. Instead of using the usual letters and decimal numbers, we label both with a pair of binary digits (bits) in Diagram 9. This highlights that we need to somehow encode the position of our key (in the third column of the second row) as 0110.Diagram 9: One possible configuration of “coins”.With our two square chessboard, we can label the first square 0 and the second square 1 but how do we extend this to larger chessboards? We can number pairs of squares 0 and 1 and then do the same for pairs of pairs and so on as in Diagram 10.Diagram 10: Labeling the squares on our chessboardAnd yes, we’ve just reinvented binary counting meaning that each of the squares on our chessboard can be labelled by a 4 digit binary number as in Diagram 11.Diagram 11: Labeling each square with a binary number.Because the width of the chessboard is an even binary number: 4=2², this gives us a simple pattern when we consider the squares that have one in various positions. If we use Blue for bit 0 or D₀, Red is bit 1 or D₁, Green is bit 2 or D₂ and Yellow is bit 3 or D₃ we can more easily see how the chessboard is divided into bands as shown in Diagram 12.Diagram 12: Bands on the chessboard corresponding to locations with different bits set to 1In a sense this is the result of collapsing our 4D tesseract into 2D. Two of the dimensions represented by the pink and yellow bands have maintained their left right symmetry. The other two dimensions have had their symmetry broken by folding. We assigned binary numbers to each square on the chessboard but another way of looking at these numbers is as bit vectors: that is the coordinates of a coin location in a 4 dimensional vector space as in Equation 1.Equation 1: A bit vector as a linear combination of basis vectorsAs with all vector spaces, a general vector here is a linear combination of the independent basis vectors. However the scaling factors are all either 0 or 1 which implies that each basis vector is part of the linear combination or it is not. In effect, this vector space describes the 2x2x2x2 tesseract from Approach A.Now we could just calculate the parity of each band in Diagram 12 as before i.e. we could check if there is an odd or an even number of dark coins in each band. However we don’t actually need to count, we can just toggle between odd and even every time we encounter a dark coin in the band — this is effectively modulo 2 addition or can also be considered as a NOT operation where 0 and 1 represent False and True. We only want this NOT operation to take place when we encounter a dark coin that is in a band represented by a 1 bit in the appropriate position. There is a neat way to do this using an Exclusive OR operation.One way of looking at exclusive OR is as a controlled NOT with a control argument and a data argument. When the control argument is zero, nothing happens to the data argument. However when the control argument is one, the data argument gets inverted either from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0. Finally the exclusive OR operator available in many computer languages doesn’t just operate on a single bit. It can operate on two bit vectors where the corresponding individual bits in each vector are exclusive ORed to get the result.So all we need to do is the following. Scan the board from top to bottom calculating a cumulative value which starts as the vector 0000. Each time we encounter a dark coin, we perform an exclusive OR of our square’s location label with the current cumulative value to get the new cumulative value. At the end, this cumulative value represents the location of a square. If we use the board in Diagram 9, this turns out to be 1011. However we need the board to represent the third column of the second row or 0110. To list the bits that need to be corrected, we simply exclusive OR these two vectors together to get 1101 which is the location of the coin that we need to flip.You may wonder whether there are other logical operations we could choose when assembling the cumulative value that will indicate the key location. In practice, the choice of operator is quite constrained. We want each bit location to be independent which rules out operations involving borrows or carries. Operations like AND or OR aren’t fit for purpose either, because AND and OR ignore their second argument when the first one is 0 or 1 respectively. This makes it possible for a malicious warden to choose coins that will lock out information from a region of the board where he can then hide the key. So we need a logical operation that is always sensitive to changes in each input argument. That only leaves Exclusive OR which returns True when its arguments are different or its inverse: Equivalence which returns True when its arguments are the same.Approach C: Exceptions to the exceptionsTo ease into this approach, keep in mind the rule for leap years which has a basic condition modified by subsequent conditions:It’s a leap year if the year is divisible by 4 unless (the year is divisible by 100 unless (the year is divisible by 400)).Diagram 13: Our chessboard with a purpose applied to each squareOn the chessboard in Diagram 13, we use combinations of letters to label the rows and columns. For example A by itself represents the 2nd column; B by itself represents the the third column; A and B together represent the 4th columns and no A or B indicates the first column. This means that A can indicate either the second or the forth column. The squares are also labeled with combinations of letters. By analogy with the leap year rule we have the following (involving all the squares that contain A in their label):A square is set if it has a black “coin”. We are referring to an A column if square A is set unless AB is set unless AC is set unless ABC is set unless AD is set unless ABD is set unless ACD is set unless ABCD is set.The rules for B columns and C and D rows are very similar. English is a little vague when it comes to logic but X unless Y could be regarded as X and not Y. So if X and Y are invited to a party but really don’t like each other we might have the rule X unless Y and Y unless X, more formally (X and not Y) and (Y and not X) which is exclusive OR. Because our Xs and Ys are disjoint, the full rule of X will give us one half of the exclusive OR and the full rule for Y will give us the other half.When my friend Peter came up with this approach, knowing my love of Pascal’s triangle, he was keen to point out the numbers of squares are 1 with no letters, 4 with one letter, 6 with 2 letters, 4 with 3 letters and 1 with 4 letters which is a row of the triangle: 1 4 6 4 1.To understand why this is, let’s look at the simpler 2x2 example in Diagram 14 . We are just interested in numbers of letters, so we can replace our As and Bs with the more general X and we get a graphical representation of (1+x)² and another row of the triangle: 1 + 2 x+1 x²Diagram 14: A justification for why Pascal’s triangle makes an appearanceBy analogy our 4x4 would represent (1+x)⁴ but that does suggest we should reorder our square labeling as in Diagram 15. Please note that this might look more elegant, but the order of the squares is irrelevant and their labeling doesn’t need to match up with the row and column labeling used to identify the key location.Diagram 15: The chessboard with the squares reordered and those containing a light “coin” showing grey textWhen we evaluate the four rules for the board configuration shown in Diagram 9, we discover that the rule for B produces False while the rules for A,C and D all produce True indicating the second column of the forth row. The key is located in BC so we need to changes the results of rules AB and D which we can do by flipping the coin at ABD to light color.We can emphasize how the rows and columns overlap by using colors: blue for A, red for B, green for C and yellow for D as in Diagram 16.Diagram 16: The same chessboard using separate colors for each letterWhile both A and C are in two pieces each, this is basically a Venn Diagram for 4 sets similar to that in Diagram 17.Diagram 17: A complete Venn Diagram for 4 sets.Diagram 16 keeps all the overlaps in the Venn Diagram the same size. In two dimensions, this is only possible with some non contiguous sets in the diagram. Of course Approach A is also effectively a Venn Diagram in 4 dimensions where all the overlaps are the same size.Nothing to do with our problem here, but interestingly, when the consistency of overlap size is relaxed, it’s possible to get some remarkably symmetrical Venn diagrams in 2D such as this gorgeous 11 set example:Diagram 18: A symmetrical Venn Diagram for 11 sets by Mamakani and RuskeyBack to our chessboard where we can go even further. Let’s say A,B,C and D represent single element sets so that A={0}, B={1}, C={2}, D={3}, then all the squares on the chessboard reading from top left to bottom right represent the entire Power Set for the set {0,1,2,3} as shown in Equation 2. A Power Set is the set of all possible subsets of a given set.Equation 2: The Power Set for {0,1,2,3}Thus one can see how a power set for a set with n elements itself has 2ⁿ elements. As each of the subsets represents one way of choosing k elements from a set with n elements, we have another reason for Pascal’s triangle in Equation 3.Equation 3: Numbers of subsets with k elements in the power set for a set with n elementsOur chessboard, by having some dark coins, has selected one particular subset from the Power Set. This subset is itself a collection of elements which themselves are subsets of {0,1,2,3}. The subset selected by the chessboard is in fact (A∪B)⊕(A∪C)⊕D⊕(B∪C)⊕(A∪B∪D)⊕(A∪C∪D)⊕(A∪B∪C∪D). In order to reduce this expression, we’re going to make use of the identities in Equation 4.Equation 4: Set Identity Rules that can be used for reductionThe first two rules in Equation 4 work in tandem to ensure that an odd number of Xs exclusive ORed together produces an X whereas an even number produces the null set. The third rule distributes exclusive OR across union (also called disjunction). It’s worth emphasizing that this is not a general rule and only works because Y and Z are disjoint. Not relevant here but there is a general distribution rule involving exclusive OR shown in Equation 5:Equation 5: General distribution rule for intersection over exclusive ORIntersection (also called conjunction) distributes over exclusive OR. In fact these two operations form the field GF(2) where intersection is equivalent to modulo 2 multiplication and exclusive OR is equivalent to modulo 2 addition.So now, with the help of our identities, we can do the reduction as shown in equation 6 which indicates the square ACD as expected.Equation 6: Reducing the Chessboard set expressionSo to sum up, the chessboard is the set of all possible subsets of the set of 4 elements- the power set of {0,1,2,3}. For a set of n elements, the power set contains 2ⁿ elements and so there are 2⁴=16 squares on the chessboard , one for each subset. Moreover the dark coins select a set of these subsets which is in fact a subset of the power set- one of 2^(2^n) = 2¹⁶ = 65536 such subsets. Our algorithm for identifying the key square from a board configuration is in fact a mapping from a subset of the power set of {0,1,2,3} to a subset of {0,1,2,3}.If you’ve ever played Reversi or Othello, you’ve engaged in a power struggle over a power set where one player is striving to fill the set and the other to empty it. :-)In approach B, each square was identified by a unique binary number which could also be regarded as a bit vector. In approach C, each square is identified by a unique set. This is not that surprising because in programming languages, bit vectors are often used to encode sets that may only contain small numbers. The typical word length in a modern computer is 64 which allows us to efficiently encode sets that contain as elements any of the numbers from 0 to 63. For sparse sets with lots of missing elements, a hash table is more efficient because a 0 bit is not needed to record each absence.Approach D: Self CompositionDiagram 19: Self Composition of some 2 and 3 dimensional shapes.When Category Theory was developed to formalize fundamental structures in various branches of mathematics, it was so abstract that few thought it would ever have a practical application. Yet very quickly the idea of Composition, for example, has turned out to be an extremely powerful way of addressing problem domains using Functional Programming. You can get a very informal idea of self composition from Diagram 19. Here we see that a square can be composed from 4 smaller squares and a triangle can be composed from 4 smaller triangles, 3 at the corners and one upside down in the middle. Hexagons can tile the plane but they can’t self compose. Extending to three dimensions, we can see that a cube is composed of 8 smaller cubes. It might seem that a tetrahedron could be composed from 5 smaller tetrahedrons, one at each corner and one upside down again in the middle but that shape in the middle turns out to be an octahedron.But I digress. How can self composition help us with our chessboard? Let’s look at the simplest non trivial case of two squares again as in Diagram 3. Is there some sense in which this two square chessboard can be composed from two additional two square chessboards? We can obviously discard features not relevant to our problem like the size and color of the squares. In fact we can discard everything but the coin on the right which tells us which square the key is under (dark=right, light= left). In the case of a two square chessboard containing a two square chessboard in each of the left and right squares, things work nicely because each two square chessboard simplifies to a coin. But how do we generalize this to multiple levels? The answer is to consider a single coin as a special case of a stack of coins.Rather than nesting all these chessboards in our diagrams, it will be a lot neater to show the whole lot as a binary tree. Here each step of composition occurs moving up as we combine two squares containing two stacks of coins to form a single stack of coins as in Diagram 20 which will make more sense shortly.Diagram 20: Working up the tree using our composition rule at each stepFinally we get to the crux of this approach: we need a rule for combining the stacks of coins. We know the rule at the lowest level already. Make a stack of one from the coin on the right.We’re going to need 4 coins when we get to the root which we can then use to work our way back down the tree using light for left and dark for right. I got stuck initially with this method until I realized that an extra coin was needed at the top of the stack as a form of eager evaluation. Our top coin is the parity of the entire board at that node in the tree. Ordinarily this is of no interest because we can’t use it to communicate anything to our cellmate. We are obliged to flip a coin so the parity of the complete board will always change from odd to even or even to odd beyond our control. However if this is not the root node of the tree, the parity of the complete board will be of use if that board turns out to be on the right hand of the next node up. If it is on the left hand, the whole board parity is discarded. Producing intermediate results that we might need and discarding them if we don’t is a characteristic of parallel systems.This all leads us to the rule for combining stacks down in Equation 7.Equation 7: The rule for combining stacks of coinsHere ⚬ represents the operation of composing two stacks of coins to form a new stack that is one higher. Stacks of coins are numbered from the top down. [0] indicates the top coin and [>0] indicates every coin except the top. The comma represents concatenation where multiple stacks are merged to form a single stack. Finally ⊕ represents exclusive OR which can be applied to two single coins. However it can also be applied to two stacks of coins where this implies that the operation is actually being applied to corresponding individual coins in each stack.⊕ requires its arguments to have the same number of coins. The result in other cases is undefined because there will be at least one coin with no corresponding coin in the other stack. To avoid this undefined behavior, we need to always combine stacks with the same size. This implies that that the tree we are working with needs to be perfectly balanced i.e. have the same depth everywhere. This in turn means that the chessboard can only contain a number of squares that is expressible as a whole power of two. 3Blue1Brown has a very neat alternative justification for this limitation involving graphs and coloring.The rule in Equation 7 might be easier to understand if we work through an actual example with coin stacks as down in Equation 8.Equation 8: An example of this rule being applied to two stacks of coinsNext we need to build up a stack of coins corresponding to the location of the key as shown in Diagram 21. Each time we move up the tree we add a coin to the stack. If we entered the node from the left, this coin is light and if we entered from the right it is dark.Diagram 21: Working our which stack of coins will address the location of the keyNow (Equation 9), we take the stack of coins assembled in Diagram 21, discard the top one for whole board parity and exclusive OR this stack with the stack that we generated in Diagram 20.Equation 9: Exclusive ORing two stacks at the root to get the stack we need to walk down the treeWe now have the stack of coins that address the square on the chessboard containing the coin that we need to flip. We walk down the tree (Diagram 22), taking the top coin off the stack at each step and going left if it is light and right if it is dark. And that’s all there is to it. :-)Diagram 22: Walking down the tree using the stack of coins as the address of the flip square.This might seem more complicated than the other approaches. However it has one useful feature- it is a parallel algorithm. For the last half century, we have been thoroughly spoiled by Moore’s law where processor speed has been doubling roughly every two years. These halcyon days are coming to an end, so we need to move away from doing things one at a time. Algorithms and their implementation will need to be inherently parallel to address the problems in our future.If you’d like to see how to go from these binary trees to modular logic networks that can perform the individual tasks for both prisoners, do let me know in the comments.Practical Application: Huffman CodingThis is not just a fun problem in recreational mathematics. We can turn it on its head to implement Huffman coding — an early form of error compression used in digital communications and recording. This time the arrangement of coins on the chessboard represents a message and the symbolic key is always under square 0000 in the top left corner. A single coin can then be flipped representing an error in the message. Using our existing algorithm we can determine which coin this is and flip it back in order for the 4 bits to address square 0000 again i.e. even parity on the right for every dimension.In order to always achieve even parity, we need a single coin for every dimension that can be flipped if necessary to make the number of coins on the right even. These parity squares are not available for data. Also the 0000 square is not available because an error can’t be detected here. For a small number of dimensions this is ridiculously inefficient. For example for 2x2 board, we have only 1 data bit. However each time we add a dimension we double the number of bits available and only have to subtract 1 for use as a parity bit. This deal gets better and better every time we double the block size so the efficiency is (2ⁿ -n -1) / 2ⁿ which works out to 69% data squares for our small chessboard (n=4) and 89% data squares for a normal sized chessboard (n=6). However if we go too far we will make the probability of double or triple errors too likely and these can’t be corrected by this scheme.Diagram 23: The parity squares for n=2, 4 and 63blue1brown explores Huffman Coding in more detail here. The Exclusive OR operation is key to the efficient operation of this algorithm. This operation has all sorts of other cool applications. It can be used to encrypt a message by exclusive ORing the data with a random key of the same length. The receiver repeats the operation to recover the data. It can allow one drive to backup two other drives in some forms of RAID storage. It truly is the star of boolean algebra.ConclusionSo having investigated these various approaches, we may have developed an intuition for the problem space. We can change which squares we use to encode different bit combinations. We can aggregate tails instead of heads; We can aggregate the coins on the left instead of the right. We can use the equivalence operation instead of exclusive OR. However all these just represent symmetries. It makes no fundamental difference to the underlying solution regardless of which of these we choose. And of course all our various approaches used different mathematics to converge on the same solution.As far as this problem is concerned, there is no difference between a binary dimension in a vector space, a binary digit, a set or indeed a level in a perfectly balanced binary tree.For other takes on this wonderfully evocative problem, have a look Matt Parker and Grant Sanderson’s video conversation discussing solutions in an actual dungeon (well almost). There is an interactive version of approach B available here.

Convolution Neural Network Maths Intuition,https://towardsdatascience.com/convolution-neural-network-maths-intuition-6b047cb48e90?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"Neural Networks,Artificial Intelligence,Deep Learning,Convolutional Network,Mathematics","It took me soo much time to understand how CNN is working. And trust me, the content on this is incredibly low, like really low. Everywhere they will tell you how forward propagation works in CNN, but never even start on backward prorogation. And without understanding the full picture, one’s understanding always remains half-baked.Pre-requisitesShould be familiar with Basics of CNN — Convolution layer, Max Pooling, Fully Connected layer. Do a basic google search and understand these concepts. Should take an hour or so to get started.Differential calculus — Should know how chain rule works and basic rules of differentiation.Should know how back propagation maths actually works in ANN. I would highly recommend reading my previous article on this, in case you aren’t aware.Nature of this articleSo, my main problem with the rest of the articles was — nowhere they have mentioned the overall flow. Each layer and concepts were beautifully explained but how do backpropagation works across the layers — that info was missing. So, it was very difficult for me to visualize how the errors were flowing backward overall. So, this article will take a few scenarios of CNN and will try to make you understand the overall flow.The intent is not to cover depth but the breadth and overall flow. For depth, I’ll point you to the relevant articles wherever needed to help you with a deeper intuition. Consider this article as an index for CNN maths. Just to set the expectations clearly, this won’t be a 5 min read. But, will ask you to read up relevant articles as and when required.Scenario 1: 1 Convolution Layer + 1 Fully Connected LayerImage by AuthorForward PassX is the input image, say (3*3 matrix) and Filter is a (2*2 matrix). Both will be convoluted to give output XX (2*2 matrix).Now, XX will be flattened and will be fed to a fully connected network with w (1*4 matrix) as weights, which will give an— Output.Finally, we will calculate Error in the end by calculating mean squared error between Y (expected) and Output (actual).Image by AuthorI would highly advise you to calculate XX on your own. This will give you an intuition of Convolution layer.The Future of Humanity is Genetic Engineering and Neural Implants | Data Driven InvestorSXSW the leading tech, music, and film festival is on March 13-22nd 2020. It will feature talks on cutting edge…www.datadriveninvestor.comBackward PassThe goal of the backward pass is to choose such values of Filter and w, so that we can decrease E. So, basically our goal is how should we change w and Filter, so that E can be decreased.Image by AuthorLet’s start with the first term.Image by AuthorGuess how?!Line 1: Using chain rule.Line 2: Using differential calculus. Spend a minute on this. Should be easily understandable. If not check my previous article (mentioned in the pre-requisite). Or check this one.Before moving forward, do make sure you do these calculations on your own. Please comment in case this is not easily understandable.Moving to the second term.Image by AuthorOoo.. too much of weird logic here? Stick with me, will help you understand this.Line 1: Basic chain ruleLine 2: 1st and third term is on the lines of above calculations itself. Again spend a minute or do it on paper to understand this.Now, what the heck is this rotated w!? Took me a really long time to understand how this was calculated. For this, you need to go through these concepts in the mentioned order only.Transposed Convolution — Output is [1*1 matrix] and XX is [1*4 matrix (because was flattened here)], right. So, when we backpropagate, we are increasing the size of the matrix. Transpose convolution helps in this. Fast forward the video and just see the logic where they are taking transpose convolution.Now take a deep breath, and read through this. This is the most important one to understand the intuition for calculating how output changes with filter and X. Pasting the conclusion from the above article. JFYI, don’t get confused from Full convolution, its nothing but Transpose convolution (which you just understood above).SourceConclusively, we can decrease Filter and w value as this.Image by AuthorScenario 2– 2 Convolution Layer + 1 Fully Connected LayerImage by AuthorNow, add as many layer of convolution, our approach will remain the same. As usual, the goal would be:Image by AuthorFirst 2 terms we have already calculated above. Let’s see what will be the formula for the last term.Image by AuthorIn case you need to deep dive into this. I would recommend this article. And calculate new F1, F2 and w accordingly.Scenario 3— What about Max Pooling layer??Max Pooling is an important concept of the CNN and how does back propagation work for it?Image by AuthorIf you think about it, there are no variables in max pooling layer like filters. So, we don’t need to adjust any value here.But, it’s affecting my previous layers, right?! It’s reducing the size of matrix by combining few entries in a matrix to a single digit. Basically, it does affect backpropagation. It says that values that have non-maximum value won’t have any gradient.So, what we are saying here is — All the values which doesn’t have maximum value will have 0 as their value. More depth.Image by AuthorHave tried to put all good and relevant articles in one place, and to help you see the overall picture of convolution. Please go through the above and let me know if something still stands missing in the overall flow — will be happy to edit it to accommodate the same.Written byVidisha JitaniEngineering Manager @Shuttl 👩‍💻 | ML Enthusiast | Amateur Blogger ✍️ | Perpetual Learner 📚 | Wannabe Entrepreneur | Occasional ArtistFollow178 Sign up for The Daily PickBy Towards Data ScienceHands-on real-world examples, research,  tutorials, and cutting-edge techniques delivered Monday to Thursday.

Neurophysiology and Artificial Neural Networks,https://medium.com/swlh/neurophysiology-and-artificial-neural-networks-7084aff45eed?source=tag_archive---------4-----------------------,"Neuroscience,Neural Networks,Learning,Mathematics","Source: Viaframe/Getty ImageI’m not a doctor in medicine, but I’m really fascinated by biology and especially how animals work. The only real pieces of intelligence we know so far are animals. That’s where almost all our inspiration in AI comes from.Animals, for a large part, have a sensory and/or nervous system, and sometimes a central system to analyze information deeply. They are agents evolving in an environment, which only “goal” is to survive — it is implicit since this survival behaviour is embedded in the world, you can’t escape it (otherwise, you’re dead). Evolution has progressively selected the most “fitted” behaviours, to reach the species we have today.It appears that, for most species, this nervous system can be described as a set of neurons, of different forms, communicating with each other. Our artificial neurons are completely inspired by this, and we’ll see how in more detail.The biological neuronWe can describe a neuron as a compute unit, handling information and sending it to neighbours. In the real world around us, a neuron is quite complicated and doesn’t have a unique structure. But we will focus on the main characteristics.A neuron has many receptors, the dendrites, and a unique canal to send the information : the axon. The nucleus is also called the soma and is in the middle of all these “cables”. Dendrites are connected to other neurons axons, and the junction is called the synapse. The neuron is gathering the signals from all the dendrites to the soma. The information, which is a time dependent electric signal, is then transformed analogically in “spikes” by the neuron, based on its intensity and frequency. A key aspect is that the neuron is only firing (spiking) if the intensity of the signal reaches a threshold.The biological neuronThe axon is really more a chain than a cable, made of Schwann cells, separated by Ranvier nodes. The signal then hops from node to node, in an active way: when the signal is at node i, node i+1 opens its Na and Kl gates to create a potential and creates a new signal, which will be passed to node i+2 and so on. In the dendrite, however, there is no active signal transmission. Therefore, the dendrite is really a classical cable inside which ions can move. There is a no come back system such that the cable is only one way (end of the dendrite to the soma). We’ll see that it’s not completely true in the learning section, but a good approximation for now.With what we just said, we can derive a model of the neuron. The most famous one is the Hodgkin–Huxley model, describing very precisely the process of Na and Kl gates, and giving you the potential of the soma based on the input signal received from the dendrites. The equation is the following:Hodgkin-Huxley model for neuron firingThis is a differential equation where I is the input current (fixed function of time), and Vm is the potential of the membrane. The coefficients g_K, g_Na and g_l also depend on time. This gives us what we need: how the potential of the soma is affected by the input current coming from the dendrites.The artificial neuronUsing the HH model is not very practical and does not really help us design artificial neurons: solving this differential equation is hard and creating a whole network of such neurons is very expansive in computing resources.That’s why a new model came out: the perceptron. The idea is to largely simplify the process of the neuron and only keep the important parts. We can model the first gathering of signals from dendrites as a big sum, with a constant coefficient for each input. These coefficients are called the weights, and model the distance/conductance/… between the soma and the synapse corresponding to the input.Then, with this big linear function of inputs, we need to model what a ‘spike’ is. Let’s be simple: if the output value is above a threshold, then we put it to 1 (spike !), else 0. We call this function sigma (it is the heavyside function). Finally, our output y can be written:The perceptron.In this simple formula, you have more or less all that we call ‘AI’ today. GANs, CNNs, Transformers, RNNs etc, all use this formula, where sigma can be a different non-linear function than the heavyside, N is very very big and the w vector of weights is well chosen.NetworksThe power of neurons reside in how you organize them in networks. How do you pipe neurons together such that they produce an interesting result (different from gaussian noise, that would be great) ?In our perceptron formula, we took the simple case where we have inputs and want to compute the output. But what if the output of our neuron is actually plugged to another neuron to become an input ? If we have N neurons, each neuron has a potential x_i and n_i neurons point to it, we can write, for every i in {1, …, N}:If we accept a zero value for our weights w_ij, then we can have n_i = N and rewrite the weights as a big matrix W and the potentials as a matrix X:The perceptron in a network whose weight matrix is W.Much cleaner, right ? This defines a dynamical system where X⁰ has to be defined (initial state). The weight matrix W can be very sparse: if neuron i does not receive any input from neuron j, W_ij=0. In the human brain, the number of synapses per neuron is in average 10000=10⁴, while the number of neurons is around 100000000000=10¹¹. This leads to only 10¹⁵ synapses in total (number of non zero values in the W matrix) out of (10¹¹)²=10²² possible connections. And yes, a neuron can be connected to itself.This equation is actually the one used as is for recurrent neural networks, which are extremely general. In today real ML applications, we mostly use feedforward neural networks. In this case, we replace t by a i, which correspond to the layer number, and W now depends on i as well. So we have:Layer i+1 potential based on layer i potentialWe can name Y = X_n where n is the last layer, and we get what we call in AI a feedforward neural network. Y is the output layer of the figure below.LearningArtificialThis class of functions (layers of sigma composed with a linear weight matrix) is universal, meaning any function can be approximated as close as you want by a function from the class, provided that the number of neurons N is large enough. Then, why wouldn’t we use this class to approximate any function ? Actually, we have a load of functions that we know exist, answer our needs but which we unfortunately can’t describe analytically and which are not solution to any (differential) equation.Some examples of such functions:classify whether an image represent a cat or a dogfind the best move (maximizing the probability of winning) in a given situation for games (chess, Go, starcraft, DotA)output the most probable next word for a given sentenceTo learn this kind of function, we use artificial neural networks. Let’s call F the function we try to learn. In practice, we’ll try to learn which function F* from the neural network class minimizes the error, ie the distance between F and F*. To do that, we need a way to characterise F simply: we use a cost function, such that F is the minimum of it. Then we just try to find F* (which is only a bunch of numbers, the neural network weights) which minimizes the cost function, using the gradient descent algorithm (or similar) and backpropagation under the hood.Gradient descent algorithmBiologicalWhat happens in the brain ? Actually, we don’t exactly know how the brain adapts and learns so quickly. But we’ve got clues.First, bioscientists observed that two neurons firing at the same time increased the strength of their connections through time. This is called the Hebb’s rule, and was the first rule we tried to apply to our networks. This rule is under many modern algorithms (attention blocks, LSTMs). However, we slowly changed the paradigm to use backpropagation instead.This rule comes from the observation that, even though we thought for a long time that the dendrites can’t transmit information (as axons), they actually, in a limited amount. Especially for feedback signals, from the soma to the synapses. You can expect this signal to change the properties of the synapse and therefore its strength.The question: is backpropagation really happening in the brain ? is still open and I suggest you watch this nice seminar from Geoffrey Hinton in Stanford.ConclusionLife is very complex and the fact that most intelligent animals have a brain means it must be a very good asset in the survival race. AI has no other inspiration than what we humans can observe ; intelligent life in our environment is a good one.Our algorithms are vastly inspired by the brain: we use the same computing unit (the neuron, with the ‘integrate and fire’ schema), the same powerful emergence system (networks) and the same learning algorithm (backpropagation). However, they still differ a lot since they don’t have the same limitations and are not used for the same purpose. They are not made out of flesh, but can be scaled on thousands of servers at the same time. Their purpose is not to survive on Earth, but at best in a complicated 3D environment made by some talented level designers.The StartupMedium's largest active publication, followed by +723K people.

What is an Approximation Algorithm?,https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/what-is-an-approximation-algorithm-59f847cb03fd?source=tag_archive---------5-----------------------,"Mathematics,Algorithms,Science,Education,Approximation Algorithms","IntroductionWhen we are faced with a combinatorial optimization problem, our goal is to design an algorithm that satisfies three important properties.(1) It is efficient, i.e., runs in time polynomial with respect to the input size.(2) It returns an optimal solution.(3) It works for every instance of the problem.However, when we deal with an NP-hard problem, it is not at all clear whether such algorithms that satisfy all three aforementioned properties even exist. So, one natural approach to slightly simplify our lives is to relax one of the three properties. In the case of approximation algorithms, we decide to relax property (2). This means that we are interested in efficient algorithms that always return feasible solutions, and what we care to bound is the gap between the value of the solution they return and the value of an optimal solution.More formally, if we are given a minimization problem whose optimal value is OPT, then an α-approximation algorithm, for some α ≥ 1, is an efficient algorithm that returns a feasible solution whose value is at most α OPT.Similarly, if we are given a maximization problem whose optimal value is OPT, then an α-approximation algorithm, for some α ≥ 1, is an efficient algorithm that returns a feasible solution whose value is at least OPT / α.For example, suppose we have an instance of a minimization problem whose optimal value is 100, and we are also given a 2-approximation algorithm. Then, if we run this algorithm on that instance, we are guaranteed that the algorithm will return a feasible solution of value at most 2 x 100 = 200.Observe that a 1-approximation algorithm is an algorithm that optimally solves the given problem.Although approximation algorithms are in many cases replaced by heuristics when it comes to practical applications, they are of significant importance as a theoretical tool for exploring the limits of efficient computation, and a very rich theory has been built around them during the last five decades. A particularly fascinating aspect of NP-hard problems is that, although they are all equivalent (within polynomial factors in the running time) when it comes to exact solvability, their behavior varies when it comes to their approximability. For example, there exist NP-hard problems thatadmit arbitrarily good approximation algorithms, i.e., (1+ε)-approximation for any constant ε > 0, orproblems that have a constant factor approximation, but that constant cannot be made arbitrarily small, i.e., problems that do not have an a-approximation, for some constant a ≥ 1, unless P = NP, orproblems that only have super constant factor approximation algorithms (e.g., (log n)-approximation), orproblems that are not approximable at all (unless P = NP).Designing an approximation algorithm is a highly non-trivial task that requires deep understanding of the problem in question. A significant barrier usually comes from the fact that an approximation algorithm has to return a solution that is comparable (within a certain factor) to the optimal value, although it is NP-hard to compute this optimal value! A way to overcome this is to study the structure of the problem and find good proxies for that optimal value.For example, if we are given a minimization problem, then it might be the case that there are efficiently computable lower bounds for OPT. If this is the case, then we can evaluate the performance of the algorithm with respect to that lower bound LB instead of the true OPT. If we are able to design an algorithm that returns a solution of cost at mostCOST ≤ α LB,then, since LB ≤ OPT, we immediately get thatCOST ≤ α OPT,which implies that we have an α-approximation algorithm!The same reasoning applies to maximization problems as well, where we look for a good upper bound UB for OPT.In the sections that follow, we discuss two examples that will illustrate some of the general principles that people use when they design approximation algorithms. The first one concerns a maximization problem and the second one concerns a minimization problem.A 2-approximation algorithm for Maximum CutIn the Maximum Cut problem, we are given a graph G = (V, E) with edge weights w(e) > 0 for every edge e in E, and the goal is to compute a bipartition {A, B} of the vertex set such that both sets A and B are non-empty, that maximizes the weight of the edges cut, i.e., the edges whose endpoints are in different sets of the bipartition.The Maximum Cut problem is one of the well-known NP-hard problems. In this section, we will discuss a very simple greedy 2-approximation algorithm for it.We start by arbitrarily enumerating the vertices of the graph.The algorithm is straightforward. In words, it processes the vertices, one by one, and adds each of the vertices to the side of the partition that maximizes the weight of the edges cut so far. The pseudo-code of the algorithm is given below.1) A = empty_set;2) B = empty_set;3) for i = 1,...,n:       Let Tᵢ be the set of edges connecting vᵢ to A;       Let Rᵢ be the set of edges connecting vᵢ to B;       if w(Tᵢ) > w(Rᵢ) then           add vᵢ to B;       else           add vᵢ to A;4) Return {A,B};It is straightforward to see that the above algorithm runs in polynomial time and always returns a feasible solution. In order to evaluate its performance, we first look for an upper bound on OPT, the optimal value. An immediate upper bound is w(E), the total weight of all edges. Formally, we have thatOPT ≤ w(E).It turns out that this is a sufficient bound in order to show that the above algorithm is a 2-approximation algorithm.To analyze the algorithm, we start by observing that each edge of the graph will be considered at some iteration of the algorithm. More precisely, an edge e = (vⱼ, vₖ), with j < k, will belong to either Tₖ or Rₖ. This implies thatGiven the greedy choices that the algorithm makes, at each iteration i the algorithm “cuts” at least half of the weight w(Tᵢ) + w(Rᵢ). This means that the total weight w(A,B) of the edges cut by the bipartition returned by the algorithm isThus, we get that w(A,B) ≥ w(E)/2. And since OPT ≤ w(E), we conclude thatw(A,B) ≥ OPT/2.We have just proved that our algorithm is a 2-approximation algorithm! Moreover, if we look at the proof a bit more closely, we can see that we also proved that in any graph, there exists at least one bipartition that cuts at least half of the total weight of all edges!Photo by Markus Spiske on UnsplashBefore continuing, we note that an important question to ask is how tight or loose our analysis is. In other words, are there cases where the algorithm indeed returns a solution of weight half of the optimal weight or is this factor of 2 an artifact of our analysis? It turns out that the above analysis is indeed tight.To see this, consider a triangle with:vertices a, b and c.edges (a,b), (b,c), (a,c) with weights w(a,b) = w(a,c) = 1 and w(b,c) = ε, where ε > 0 is a very small number.Since the algorithm starts with an arbitrary ordering of the vertices, it might consider the vertices in the following order: b, c, a. In such a case, it will first assign b to A, then c to B, and then a will be placed to A. Thus, the final bipartition will beA = {a, b}B = {c}.The weight of the edges cut is ALG = 1 + ε. However, it is easy to see that the bipartition A’ = {a} and B’ = {b, c} is optimal and cuts edges of total weight OPT = 2. We conclude that,OPT/ALG ≥ 2/(1 + ε),where ε is an arbitrarily small number, and so this ratio can be arbitrarily close to 2. This implies that our analysis is tight.As a final note, there exist stronger approximation algorithms for the Maximum Cut problem, and in particular, there is a really beautiful algorithm of Goemans and Williamson that gives a much better approximation factor of roughly 1.139.A 2-approximation algorithm for the Minimum Vertex Cover problemIn the Minimum Vertex Cover problem, we are given a vertex-weighted graph G = (V, E) with non-negative vertex weights w(u) ≥ 0 for every u in V. The goal is to compute a subset of vertices S of minimum weight such that for every edge (u,v) in E, either u is contained in S or v is contained in S (or both).The Minimum Vertex Cover problem is one of the most well-studied NP-hard problems. We will now discuss what is essentially the state-of-the-art when it comes to the approximability of the problem (there is a slightly stronger algorithm for the problem compared to the one we present here, but the improvement it achieves tends to 0 as the graphs grow larger).One of the most successful and systematic ways of obtaining the bounds on the value of OPT which we discussed in the previous section is by using some kind of convex relaxation for the problem. Here, it is straightforward to write a linear programming relaxation for the problem. For each vertex u, we introduce a variable x(u) that indicates whether the vertex is selected to our vertex cover or not. By dropping the integrality constraints, we obtain the following efficiently-solvable linear program.The LP relaxation for Minimum Vertex Cover.It is easy to see that the above LP is indeed a relaxation of the problem, in the sense that every feasible vertex cover can be encoded as a solution of the above LP. This immediately implies that the optimal value OPT(LP) of the above LP is smaller or equal to the value OPT of the minimum vertex cover. In other words, we have just obtained a lower bound for OPT!The proposed algorithm is now very straightforward.(1) Solve LP relaxation and obtain optimal solution x.(2) Return S, where S is the set of vertices whose x-value is at least 1/2.Clearly, the above algorithm runs in polynomial time. So, there are two things to discuss. The first is whether the algorithm always returns a feasible vertex cover, and the second is what is the cost of the solution returned.To address the first point, let S be the set returned, and let (u,v) be an edge of the graph. Since x is a feasible LP solution, this means thatx(u) + x(v) ≥ 1,which implies that either x(u) or x(v) is at least 1/2. Thus, at least one of the vertices u and v will be included in S, and so, the set S is indeed always a feasible vertex cover.We will now argue about the cost of the set S. We haveIn the above computations, we used the fact that every vertex u in S satisfies x(u) ≥ 1/2. Finally, since OPT(LP) ≤ OPT, we conclude thatw(S) ≤ 2 OPT.In words, the above algorithm is a 2-approximation algorithm!As in the previous example, we again study the tightness of the above factor. It turns out the factor of 2 is again tight. The example is very simple. We consider a single edge (u,v), where the weight of both u and v is set to 1. The solution x that sets x(u) = x(v) = 1/2 is an optimal fractional solution. If such a solution is given to our algorithm, then our algorithm will return the set {u,v} as a feasible vertex cover, and its weight is 2. Clearly, the optimal solution only selects either u or v (but not both) and has weight 1. Thus, the gap between the two solutions is 2.ConclusionThe field of approximation algorithms is vast and quite technical, and we only got a glimpse of the arguments that are used to design good approximation algorithms. In my personal opinion, this is an area full of beautiful ideas and techniques, and the interested reader is encouraged to start exploring two great books that have been written in the subject and are the following:“Approximation Algorithms” by Vijay V.

Save it in Journal.Example 1:Source: Linked List Cycle (LeetCode)Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1Output: trueExplanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.Idea 1: Use a SetThe naive way of solving a cycle detection problem like this can be solved easily with a set:Idea 2: Floyd’s Cycle Detection AlgorithmThe first approach was a great idea, except it isn’t very smart. Let’s try to improve the code with Floyd’s Cycle Detection Algorithm.The idea behind Floyd’s Cycle Detection Algorithm is where there are two pointers - a fast pointer (“hare”) and a slow pointer (“tortoise”). The slow pointer moves one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps. Both pointers will move around the (possibly cyclic) list. If the list is not cyclic, both pointers will never contain the same data. If the list is cyclic, sooner or later, both pointers will meet. (see below for proof)Now let’s prove that Floyd’s Cycle Detection Algorithm works mathematically. We can set the distance from the beginning to the start of the cycle to be x, the distance from the start of the cycle to the first place where the fast and slow pointer meets y, and the distance from y to the start of the cycle z.Now we have our variables, we can define how many steps the fast and slow pointer moves:fast pointer: x + 2y + zslow pointer: x + y + zNow that you have a solid understanding of Floyd’s Cycle Detection Algorithm, let’s implement it!Implementing Floyd’s Cycle Detection AlgorithmGreat work!

Calculating the End-to-End distance of two atoms using MDAnalysis,https://medium.com/@sharifsuliman1/calculating-the-end-to-end-distance-of-two-atoms-using-mdanalysis-ab7269e4bb5b?source=tag_archive---------7-----------------------,"Molecular Dynamics,Magnitudes,Python3,Mathematics,Pythagoras","If you’ve come across this article, you must be a python-dev (like myself) that has come across MDAnalysis but reading over the docs you’ve discovered you know nothing about molecular dynamics. So let’s start at the basics: Take the distance between two atoms in space over a trajectory.I’ve got two atoms in space first I’m going to load up my topology and trajectory using mda and initiate the universe (sounds so cool):def initiate_universe(topology, trajectory):    universe = mda.Universe(topology, trajectory)    return universeif __name__ == '__main__':    # File Setup    current_directory = os.getcwd()    topology = os.path.join(current_directory, 'topology.psf')    trajectory = os.path.join(current_directory, 'trajectory.xtc')        initiate_universe(topology, trajectory)Simple, lets take a look at two specific atoms as they traverse through the trajectory in my case it’s two oxygens and we’ll quickly view the atoms using the nglviewer:oxygen_1 = universe.select_atoms('segid A and resid 1 and name O1')oxygen_4 = universe.select_atoms('segid A and resid 10 and name O4')merge = mda.Merge(oxygen_1, oxygen_4)depiction = nv.show_mdanalysis(merge)depictionIn my specific case, I have one chain that is 10 monomer units long and it uses the CHARMM selecting language of atoms and I use the merge function in mda to combine the two atoms universe for the viewer.Note: I don’t actually know if that is the correct way to do this — but it works for me :)Looks beautiful. So how do we calculate a distance from two atoms in space with three dimensions (x, y, z)The End-to-End distance is calculated using the difference between the two vectors positions in the x, y, z , square it, and take a square root of the sum. Who came up with this groundbreaking math? Pythagoras!What does the code look like?def find_magnitude(x, y, z):        # imports    # -------    import math    difference_x = x[1] - x[0]    difference_y = y[1] - y[0]    difference_z = z[1] - z[0]    difference_x = difference_x ** 2    difference_y = difference_y ** 2    difference_z = difference_z ** 2    magnitude = math.sqrt(difference_x + difference_y + difference_z)    return magnitudeAnd we have to set up our “domains of interest” which are the two atoms.def setup_domains_of_interest(universe):                domains = {}        domains['O1'] = universe.select_atoms('segid A and resid 1 and name O1')        domains['O4'] = universe.select_atoms('segid A and  resid 10 and name O4')            return domainsI am selecting segid (Chain A), resid (Residue 1 and 10), name (Oxygen 1 and Oxygen 4). We want to store our domains as a dictionary and I believe there is some MDAnalysis funkiness about why we setup domains this way.Note: So what I have discovered is that when iterating through a trajectory having a universe.select_atoms makes my loops super low in magnitudes in order of like 3 seconds vs 24 minutes.Alright now we are cooking, let’s declare some variablescalculated_magnitudes = []timestamps = []domains = setup_domains_of_interest(universe)And now let’s set up our for loop to iterate through the trajectory, get the positions of O1 and O4 and fetch the magnitude.for timestep in universe.trajectory:            x0 = domains['O1'].positions[0][0]    x1 = domains['O4'].positions[0][0]    y0 = domains['O1'].positions[0][1]    y1 = domains['O4'].positions[0][1]    z0 = domains['O1'].positions[0][2]    z1 = domains['O4'].positions[0][2]    x = [x0, x1]    y = [y0, y1]    z = [z0, z1]            calculated_magnitudes.append(find_magnitude(x, y, z))    timestamps.append(universe.trajectory.time)        If you want to be extra fancy you can wrap a progress bar so you’re not wondering if the code is running like me…import tqdmprogressbar_trajectory = tqdm(total=len(universe.trajectory))    for timestep in universe.trajectory:            x0 = domains['O1'].positions[0][0]    x1 = domains['O4'].positions[0][0]    y0 = domains['O1'].positions[0][1]    y1 = domains['O4'].positions[0][1]    z0 = domains['O1'].positions[0][2]    z1 = domains['O4'].positions[0][2]    x = [x0, x1]    y = [y0, y1]    z = [z0, z1]            calculated_magnitudes[segid].append(find_magnitude(x, y, z))    timestamps.append(universe.trajectory.time)            progressbar_trajectory.update(1)        progressbar_trajectory.close()Run it!Looks good!

Data Types and Complexity,https://medium.com/@laura.araviciute_56661/data-types-and-complexity-c8b2103b0d66?source=tag_archive---------8-----------------------,"Data Type,Complexity,Functional Programming,Mathematics,Learning To Code","So today I learned something cool, tried to find more information about it but either it doesn’t exist (probably impossible in this day in age) or it’s not “trending” or I can’t use Google 😊Either way, I thought it was pretty cool and it brought me back to those horrid complexity classes in college, where you sat there thinking “when in the world am I ever going to use this stuff?”. So maybe I’m getting old or maybe I’m really getting into this FP stuff (found this while sat down with a cuppa reading my favorite FP book).Enough mumble, jumble, let’s get into it. A few key terms before we get started (in case you’re somewhat newbie like me and new to using these terms daily)A product: includes all of it’s given typesA co-product: materializes one of it’s given typesTotality: call a function with any input and it will always produce a valid value — no matter how many times you do it, it should not break production 😉Total function: enforces totality, it is designed for all possible input typesCounting ComplexitySo all values have built-in complexity as per below:Unit => 1 valueBoolean => 2 valuesInt => 4,294,967,295 (in other words a lot)String => let's call it infinite So to find the complexity of a product = multiply the complexity of each partLet’s have a look at some examples(Boolean, Boolean) => 4 (2*2)(Boolean, Boolean, Boolean) => 8 (2*2*2)What about the complexity of co-products? Well we add the complexity of each partAgain, some super simple examples(Boolean |: Boolean) => 4 values (2+2)(Boolean |: Boolean |: Boolean) => 6 (2+2+2)Do you sort of see where I’m going with this? After all, adding complexity is much better than multiplying it… (I know math genius in the house)Let’s have a look at an ADT with a parameter type = we multiple each part by the complexity of the type parameterOption[Boolean] => 3 values (2+1)....Some[Boolean] => 2None => 1I know, mind blowing stuff 😉Now let’s talk functions.As a general rule of thumb (or so I hear), a badly designed function is one which has a higher complexity of the functions return than the product of it’s inputs.The complexity of a total function is the output to the power of the inputLet’s see it in actionUnit => Boolean : 2 (2^1)Boolean => Boolean : 4 (2^2)Option[Boolean] => Option[Boolean] : 27 (3^3)Boolean => Int : hell of a lotInt => Boolean : hell of a lot * a lot moreWhen you think about it, a function like Int => Boolean is probably something simple, like isEven or isOdd . This function could potentially be replaced with a co-product by limiting the set of functions that are relevant. I haven’t come across much use of co-products in my day to day yet but with this new information, I hope to try and spot some improvements.I’ve just learned about these new refined libraries which provides a suite of restrictions to the contents of a data type. I haven’t used it yet myself but hope to experiment with it soon.I’ll link it here below in case anybody else is interested.fthomas/refinedrefined is a Scala library for refining types with type-level predicates which constrain the set of values described by…github.comWritten byLaura AraviciuteDistributed Systems Engineer @ WorkdayFollowData TypeComplexityFunctional ProgrammingMathematicsLearning To CodeMore from Laura AraviciuteFollowDistributed Systems Engineer @ WorkdayMore From MediumFunctional Pipe in GoAli AslRousta in The StartupPedantic DartDavid Morgan in DartHow to Record Flutter Integration Tests With GitHub ActionsJackson Zhou in Better ProgrammingUsing kpartx/losetup With Disk Image (.img) Files and PartitionsTony Tannous in The StartupIntroduction to Java Native Interface: Establishing a bridge between Java and C/C++Yiğit PIRILDAK in The StartupIntroduction to Apache Spark RDDs using PythonJaafar BenabderrazakHow to Become a Developer Without a Degree or Boot Camp — Is It Possible?Clint Winter in The StartupHighlighting a Specific Word in an Input Image Using PythonSriRam Govardhanam in Better ProgrammingAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Game Shows and Computer Codes,https://medium.com/swlh/game-shows-and-computer-codes-847a1ddfd3e6?source=tag_archive---------9-----------------------,"Startup,Internet,Mathematics,Analytics","via UnsplashThis article got to your screen through a series of leaps through a network of computers. Each node in the chain acted as a traffic conductor, receiving, sorting, and sending information toward its destination. Because information transmission isn’t perfect, periodically errors can get introduced and the message has to be checked. When a mistake occurs the message has to be resent or fixed. If the computer receiving the message can’t fix transmission errors or at least determine if the message is error-free, the network couldn’t function. But how does the receiver know if there has been a mistake? A surprisingly simple game show strategy can help illustrate how this works.Divide and conquerIn the 1940s there was a radio and television game show called Twenty Questions. The game consisted of two sides, the Answerer and the Questioners. The Answerer chooses an object and the Questioners ask a series of up to twenty yes or no questions to try to find the object that the Answerer has chosen. The Answerer can choose any object they can think of, literally any object in the world. How can the Questioners possibly come up with the Answerer’s object given the myriad of possible options and what does this have to do with error checking?Twenty Questions via WikipediaSimplify the game show problem and assume there are only 100 possible objects to pick. A good question might eliminate 90 items leaving only 10. That sounds pretty great, but what if the answer was the opposite? Now you only eliminated 10 items. Since you have no way of knowing what the answer will be, this isn’t such a great question. If you’re thinking ahead, you probably realized the best strategy is questions that eliminate roughly half of the possible answers each time.When you cut things in half repeatedly, you can get down to the right answer pretty quickly. This method is called bisection. Theoretically, with twenty ideal questions, the Questioners can distinguish between 1,048,576 objects (2²⁰). Good luck coming up with an object that can’t be found with a series of twenty well-placed questions.This same technique forms the basis for one method of error checking in computer networks.Error detectiveOne of the first error-correcting codes was invented in the 1950s by Richard Hamming, now called Hamming codes. Hamming codes are extremely efficient ways of detecting errors in a message up to a certain limit and they work just like a smart Twenty Questions player.As an example, in a message containing 256 bits (a bit is a 1 or a 0), only 8 bits (+1 extra parity bit) are needed to locate the exact position of one error in the message or detect up to two errors. For a block of information 2^x bits long, only x+1 bits are needed for error checking. This means the larger the block the more of it that can be used for the message itself!How Hamming codes check a message (via 3Blue1Brown)How does the work? Each of the error check bits is the same as one question in the Twenty Questions game for an excellent player. It checks half of the message for errors. Combine this with the other bits and you can spot the error with the least amount of questions. For an outstanding, in-depth explanation of how this works, check out Grant Sanderson’s video on his YouTube channel 3Blue1Brown.So what?What lessons can we draw from this concept and how can we use them to our advantage?Built-in checksThe first is considering the process of verification when designing a system or process. In a Hamming code, the method for detecting and locating errors is part of the message itself and can be quickly checked by the receiver with no additional information. Consider how a similar process might be implemented in other areas.Imagine a product shipped from one department to another that includes a built-in quality test that can easily be conducted upon receipt that ensures nothing was damaged in shipment. This is like that button on a jar lid that pops when you open it. If you pick up the jar on the store shelf and the button is popped, you know right away something is wrong. You didn’t have to check with the manufacturer or the store clerk, it was built into the product itself.Next, consider the process of delegating a task to an employee. If you include a description of the desired end-state so that the employee knows exactly what is expected and when the task can be considered finished, it improves the efficiency of the process. He or she won’t need to check back with you to determine if the work has been completed satisfactorily. The military uses this concept and calls it the commander’s intent which specifically defines the mission end-state.Getting to the sourceThe second idea is determining the origin of a problem as quickly as possible. How many occasions can you think of where a litany of questions or meetings were needed to make a decision? Your team has a meeting and the topic of the meeting isn’t resolved instead another meeting is scheduled.What if instead, we spent some time deciding on the best questions to ask to find the root cause of the problem or key aspect? How much time would that save? How can you quickly narrow down the possibilities and find the essence of the issue?Information theory is full of elegant solutions to complex problems. Next time you find a creative solution in one field, consider how it might be applied to others.Thanks for reading.

Fundamentals of Multivariate Calculus for DataScience and Machine Learning,https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/fundamentals-of-multivariate-calculus-for-datascience-and-machine-learning-b2c7e83445ca?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,"Machinelerning,Machine Learning,Data Science,Mathematics,Deep Learning","Photo Source — https://i.pinimg.com/originals/12/10/17/121017deafcab3026b8fba0a9bce9b68.jpgMultivariate Calculus is used all around Machine Learning and DataScience ecosystem, so having a first-principle understanding of it, is incredibly useful when you are dealing with some complex Math equations in implementing some ML Algo.To start with, as soon as you need to implement multi-variate Linear Regression, you hit multivariate-calculus which is what you will have to use to derive the Gradient of a set of multi-variate Linear Equations i.e. Derivative of a Matrix. Beyond Optimization of Neural networks (NN) cost function and variations of gradient descent algorithm here in NN and a plethora of other optimization are handled with multivariate calculus.So in this blog, I shall go over the fundamental concepts required multivariate-calculus which we will need to to understand many of the mechanisms of Machine Learning and Data ScienceWhy we need multivariate vector function in Machine-LearningIn machine learning when we have multiple independent variables to predict a dependent variable, we usually represent all independent variables in a multidimensional space.For example,Let’s consider an ML problem in which we have to predict the House Price using the following independent variables-Total Carpet-AreaNumber of FloorsDistance From Nearest AirportHere, we need to project all those data points of students in a multidimensional space where-Dimension 1- Total Carpet-AreaDimension 2 — Number of FloorsDimension 3 — Distance From Nearest AirportNow, each independent variable can be represented as a vector with respect to the dependent variable.Like,“Total Carpet-Area” vector will have a magnitude and positive direction with respect to House Price (House Price will increase if carpet-area also increases and House Price will decrease if carpet-area decreases).Similarly, “Number of Floors” will have a magnitude and positive direction with respect to House PriceHowever “Distance From Nearest Airport” vector will have a magnitude and negative direction with respect to House Price.Now, if we have a new House data for which we need to predict the Price, then we can represent its data in these 3 vectors, and the point in which the 3 vectors having an orthogonal relationship can be considered as his/her predicted mark in the final examination.Two vectors are considered to be orthogonal to each other if they are at right angles in n‐dimensional space, where n is the size or number of elements in each vector.Functions of Several VariablesMostly all of us are well aware of functions of a single (independent)variable. Many familiar quantities, however, are functions of two or more variables. For instance, the work done by a force (W = FD) and the volume of a right circular cylinder ( V =⫽Πr²h) are both functions of two variables. The volume of a rectangular solid (V = ⫽ lwh) is a function of three variables. The notation for a function of two or more variables is similar to that for a function of a single variable. Here are two examples.Similar definitions can be given for functions of three, four, or n variables, where the domains consist of ordered triples (x1, x2, x3), quadruples (x1, x2, x3, x4), and n-tuples (x1, x2, . . . , xn). In all cases, the range is a set of real numbers.Now here is a most general mathematical form of a multivariable functionMost General Mathematical form of a multivariable function.So the function f above maps n input variables (x1, … to xn) to m output variables (g1, .. to gm). And each of the g1, g2, …. gm are called component functions. And also each of the g1, g2, … gm are really a function of input variables.Using Mathematical notationsMultivariable Function-Genearal Mathematical formNote that for a multivariable vector-valued functionthe two numbers n and m can be either equal or unequal. For example, we could have functions F : R² → R² and G: R³ → R³Some actual examples.Functions of several variables can be combined in the same ways as functions of single variables. For instance, you can form the sum, difference, product, and quotient of two functions of two variables as follows.Differentiation of Function of Several VariablesThe derivative of a one-variable function measures its rate of change. Mathematically we already know from the first principle, the definition of a derivative of a single variable function definition as follows — Let D ⊆ R and let c be an interior point of D, that is, (c − r, c + r) ⊆ D for some r > 0 . A function f : D → R is said to be differentiable at c if the limitexists. In this case the value of the limit is denoted by f ′ © and is called thederivative of f at c.Now we see how a two-variable function has two rates of change: one as x changes (with y held constant) and one as y changes (with x held constant).In general, if f is a function of two variables x and y, suppose we let only x vary while keeping y fixed, say y = b, where b is a constant. Then we are really considering a function of a single variable x.We study the influence of x and y separately on the value of the function f (x, y) by holding one fixed and letting the other vary. This leads to the following definitions of Partial Derivatives of function f with respect to x and y.For all points at which the limits exist, we define the partial derivatives at the point (a, b) bySimilarly, the partial derivative of f with respect to y at (a, b), is obtained by keeping x fixed (x = a ) and finding the ordinary derivative at b of the function.So, if f is a function of two variables, its partial derivatives are the functions fx and fy defined byThe concept of a partial derivative can be extended naturally to functions of three or more variables. For instance, if w = f (x, y, z), there are three partial derivatives, each of which is formed by holding two of the variables constant. That is, to define the partial derivative of w with respect to x, consider y and z to be constant and differentiate with respect to x. A similar process is used to find the derivatives of w with respect to y and with respect to z.Partial Derivative of three variablesand it is found by treating y and z as constants and differentiating f(x, y, z) with respect to x. If w =f(x, y, z), then fx = δw/δx can be interpreted as the rate of change of w with respect to x when y and z are held fixed. But we can’t interpret it geometrically because the graph of f lies in four-dimensional space.In general, if u is a function of n variables, u = f(x1, x 2, . . . , xn), its partial deriva­tive with respect to the i-th variable x_i isBy extension, the second, third, and higher-order partial derivatives of a function of several variables, provided such derivatives exist, are defined as below.Differentiate twice with respect to x:2. Differentiate twice with respect to y:3. Differentiate first with respect to x and then with respect to y:4. Differentiate first with respect to y and then with respect to x:The numbers 3 and 4 above are called mixed partial derivatives.Quick examples and interpretations of Partial Derivative of a Multivariate FunctionExample-1Find the partial derivatives fx and fy for the functionSolution — Considering y to be constant and differentiating with respect to x producesConsidering x to be constant and differentiating with respect to y producesExample-2Find δz/δx and δz/δy if z is defined implicitly as a function of x and y bythe equationTo find δz/δx, first we differentiate implicitly with respect to x, treating y as a constant:Solving this equation for δz/δx, I getSimilarly, differentiation with respect to y i.e. δz/δy treating x as constant givesGeometry of Multivariate Function and Three-dimensional spaceFirst, a quick refresher on plain-vanilla two-dimensional space, denoted by R², is the familiar Cartesian plane. If we construct two perpendicular lines (the x- and y-coordinate axes), set the origin as the point of intersection of the axes, and establish numerical scales on these lines, then we may locate a point in R² by giving an ordered pair of numbers (x, y), the coordinates of the point. Note that the coordinate axes divide the plane into four quadrants.For any multi-variable Calculus, we need to have some basic understanding of 3-dimensional space.Three-dimensional space, denoted R³, requires three mutually perpendicularcoordinate axes (called the x-, y- and z-axes) that meet in a single point (called the origin) in order to locate an arbitrary point. Analogous to the case of R², if we establish scales on the axes, then we can locate a point in R³ by giving an ordered triple of numbers (x, y, z). The coordinate axes divide three-dimensional space into eight octants. It takes some practice to get your sense of perspective correct when sketching points in R³.Plotting a multivariate function in three-dimensional spaceCoordinate axes inthree-dimensional spaceImagine three coordinate axes meeting at the origin(0, 0, 0). A vertical axis (z), and two horizontal axes at right angles to each other (x and y). The xy-plane is horizontal, while the z-axis extends vertically above and below the plane. We generally use right-handed axes. This means that if you curl the fingers of your right hand from the positive x-axis to the positive y-axis, then your thumb will point along the positive z-axis.The x-, y-, and z-axes in R³ are alwaysdrawn in a right-handed configuration.We identify a point in 3-space by giving its coordinates (x, y, z) concerning these axes.We may imagine a picture of a three-dimensional coordinate system in terms of a room. The origin is one of the corners at floor level where two walls meet the floor. The z-axis is the vertical intersection of the two walls; the x- and the y-axis are the intersections of each wall with the floor. Points withnegative coordinates lie behind a wall in the next room or below the floor.Now a quick example, let's see how the graphs of the equations z = 0, z = 3, and z = −1 look like?The planes z = −1, z = 0, and z = 3For graph z = 0, we visualize the set of points whose z-coordinate is zero. Means it must be at the same vertical level as the origin, i.e. in the horizontal plane containing the origin. So the graph of z = 0 is the middle plane in the above figure.The graph of z = 3 is a plane parallel to the graph of z = 0, but three units above it. The graph of z = −1 is a plane parallel to the graph of z = 0, but one unit below it.The plane z = 0 contains the x- and the y-coordinate axes, and is called the xy-plane. There are two other coordinate planes. The yz-plane contains both the y- and the z-axis, and the xz-plane contains the x- and the z-axis.The three coordinate planesGraph of Univariate Function vs Multivariate FunctionIf f is a scalar-valued function of a single variable, f:R→Rf:R→R (notation R stands for the real numbers and similarly, R² is a two-dimensional vector and also denotes a 2-D coordinate system), then the graph of f is the set of points (x, f(x)) for all x in the domain of f. We call this the graph of y=f(x) since the points are lying in the xy-plane. When plotting the points in the xy-plane, they typically form a curve, such as the graph of f(x)=x² shown below.But, the graphs of functions of two or more variables are examples of surfaces. That is, a set of points (x,y,z) that satisfy an equation relating all three variables is often a surface.The graph of a function f of two variables is the set of all points (x, y, z) for which z ⫽ f(x, y) and (x, y) is in the domain of f. This graph can be interpreted geometrically as a surface in spaceNow, we define the graph of a scalar-valued function of two variables, f:R²→R in the same way. The graph is the set of points (x, y, f(x, y)) for all (x, y) in the domain of f. When often call this the graph of z=f(x, y), since the points as lying in xyz-space (instead of only xy-plane). The graph of this f(x,y) is a surface.Let’s plot an example. You saw above the graph of the single variable function y=x² is a parabola. Now extend it to make a multi-variate function.f(x,y)= x² + y²The graph of which is something called a paraboloid, a type of quadric surface.Made with 3D-Surface Graphing Online Tool — https://academo.org/demos/3d-surface-plotter/Now Geometric Interpretation of Partial Derivatives of a Multivariate FunctionThe partial derivatives of a function of two variables, z = f(x, y), have a useful geometric interpretation. If y =⫽ y0, then z ⫽ f (x, y0) represents the curve formed by intersecting the surface z = f(x, y) with the plane y = y0, as shown in below figureTherefore,represents the slope of the curve given by the intersection of z = f(x, y) and the plane x = x0 at (x0, y0, f(x0, y0))To discuss the above further, take a look at the following graph of a surfaceTo understand the geometric interpretation of partial derivatives, we recall that the equation z =f (x,y) represents the surface S (which is the graph of f ).If f (a, b) = c, then the point P(a, b, c) lies on S. By fixing y = b, we are restricting our attention to the curve C1 in which the ver­tical plane y =b intersects S. (In other words, C1 is the trace of S in the plane y =b. Likewise, the vertical plane x = a intersects S in a curve C2. Both of the curves C1 andC2 passes through point P.Now, note that the curve C1 is the graph of the function g(x) =f(x, b), so the slope of its tangent T1 at P is g′(a) = fx(a, b).The curve C2 is the graph of the function G(y) = f(a, y), so the slope of its tangent T2 at P is G′(b) = fy(a,b).Thus the partial derivatives fx(a, b), and fy(a, b) can be interpreted geometrically as the slopes of the tangent lines at P(a, b, c) to the traces C1 and C2 of S in the planes y =b and x = aPartial derivatives can also be interpreted as rates of change. If z =f(x, y), then δz/δx represents the rate of change of z with respect to x when y is fixed. Similarly, δz/δy represents the rate of change of z with respect to y when x is fixed.So to see a use case of the above implementation, lets take a quick look at the below graph of the surface z = f (x, y) and try to understand y whether each partial derivative is positive or negative.The positive x-axis points out of the page. So imagine that I am heading off in this direction from the point marked P, where we descend steeply. So the partial derivative with respect to x is negative at P, with quite a large absolute value. The same is true for the partial derivative with respect to y at P since there is also a steep descent in the positive y-direction.At the point marked Q, heading in the positive x-direction results in a gentle descent, whereas heading in the positive y-direction results in a gentle ascent.Thus, the partial derivative fx at Q is negative but small (that is, near zero), and the partial derivative fy is positive but small. Basic Rules of Partial DifferentiationOne Quick ExerciseFind the slopes in the x-direction and in the y-direction of the surface given bySolutionThe partial derivatives of f with respect to x and y areSo, in the x-direction, the slope isand in the y-direction, the slope isGeometrically,Differentiation Rules for Partial DerivativesIn the multivariate case, the basic differentiation rules that we know from high-school mathematics (e.g., sum rule, product rule, chain rule) still apply. However, when we compute derivatives with respect to vectors x we need to pay attention: Our gradients now involve vectors and matrices, and matrix multiplication is not commutative , i.e., the order matters.Product and Sum RuleChain ruleTotal Derivative of a Multivariate FunctionA total derivative of a multivariable function of several variables, each of which is a function of another argument, is the derivative of the function with respect to said argument. it is equal to the sum of the partial derivatives with respect to each variable times the derivative of that variable with respect to the independent variable.In genearl Mathematical form, the total differential of three or more variables is defined as below. For a function z = f(x, y, .. , u) the total differential isFor example, lets say, a function f(x,y,z) which is a continuous function of n variables x, y, z , with continuous partial derivatives ∂w/∂x, ∂w/∂y, ∂w/∂z. And assume x, y, z are differentiable functions x = x(t), y = y(t) , z = z(t). of a variable t. Then the total derivative of w with respect to t is given byLet's see a quick example — Find the total differential of the following functionw = x³yz + xy + z + 3 at a point (1,2,3)The total differential at the point (x0, y0, z0) isTotal DifferentialSubstituting the x, y, z values for the point (1, 2, 3) we get: wx(1, 2, 3) = 20, wy(1, 2, 3) = 4, wz(1, 2, 3) = 3 . So final ans isChain Rule of a univariate and multivariate functionFirst, the case when the Inner function is UnivariateThe inner function is UnivariateWe already have seen in the above example the implementation of the Chain Rule for the derivative of a composite of two functionsFor simple composite functionf(x)=f(g(x))The derivative isThe chain rule says that we should take a derivative of an outside function, keep an inside function untouched, and then multiply everything by the derivative of the inside function.Which in partial derivative form.In above equation, both f(x) and g(x) are functions of one variable.The chain rule is conceptually a divide and conquer strategy (like Quicksort) that breaks complicated expressions into subexpressions whose derivatives are easier to compute. Its power derives from the fact that we can process each simple subexpression in isolation yet still combine the intermediate results to get the correct overall result.Consider a function f : R² → R of two variables x1, x2 . Where, x1(t) and x2(t) are themselves functions of t. To compute the gradient of f with respect to t, we have the chain rule for multivariate functions as belowChain rule for Multi-variate Functionswhere d denotes the gradient and ∂ partial derivatives.Example of the above,Consider the following functionwhere x1 = sin t and x2 = cos t, then the corresponding derivative of f with respect to t is the followingderivative of f with respect to t.And now the case when the inner function is multi-variate function.That is, If f (x1, x2 ) is a function of x1 and x2, where x1 (s, t) and x2(s, t) are themselves functions of two variables s and t, meaning the function I want get the derivative of isf(x1(s, t), x2(s, t))In this case, the chain rule yields the following partial derivativesNote in above set, we derived a total six partial derivative.and the gradient is obtained by the matrix multiplicationLet’s see an example of this, i.e. inner function has Two Independent VariablesDerive ∂z/∂u and ∂z/∂v using the following functions:Where the inner functions areSo following our earlier rule, to implement the chain rule for two variables, we need six partial derivatives — ∂z/∂x, ∂z/∂y, ∂x/∂u, ∂x/∂v, ∂y/∂u, and ∂y/∂vSo I just put these above values to our Partial Derivative ruleNext, we substitute x(u,v)=3u+2v and y(u,v)=4u−vSimilarly, repeat the above steps for ∂z/∂vSo we the final Partial Derivative of the above problem as below.Gradient-Descent (GD) — the famous algorithm where Multivariate Calculus implementation is requiredWithout going into much detail of GD, as we know, like the derivative, the gradient represents the slope of a function.The gradient points in the direction of the largest rate of increase of the function, and its magnitude is the slope in that direction. And by the GD-algorithm, if we are at a particular value of θ (representing coefficients of the Linear Regression function) and if we want to move to a new value of θ such that the new loss is less than the current loss then we should move in the direction opposite to the gradient.To understand and implement these gradients we need to return to partial derivatives (of the cost function), which we can reorganize into a row (i.e. horizontal) vector as below:The above is what we call the gradient of f(x,y), or ∇ f(x,y)That is we find the gradient of the function f with respect to x by varying one variable at a time and keeping the others constant. The gradient is then the collection of these partial derivatives.So what it means is, if we have the gradient for function f(x,y) this is the same as writing the partial derivative of function f with respect to x and the partial derivative with respect to y:The general Mathematical form will be as below.For a function f(x), of n variables x1 , . . . , xn we define the partial derivatives asand collect them in the row vectorwhere n is the number of variablesLet's see an example, For f (x, y) = (x + 2y 3)², we obtain the below two partial derivatives using Chain Rule.And so now we get the gradient of the function∇ f(x,y) by organizing these partials into a horizontal (row) vector formGradient of f(x,y)2(x+2y³) is the change in f(x,y) with respect to a change in x, while 12(x+2y³)*y² is the change in f(x,y) with respect to a change in y.Difference between a Gradient and a DerivativeBy now we have seen, the gradient holds all the partial derivatives of a multivariable function. Before we dive deep into Gradient-Descent algorithm below, let’s explore the difference between Derivative and Gradient.The derivative is a number, which shows the rate of change when some point in our function moves in a particular direction. We can visualize the derivative as a slope of a function which goes along some direction on a graph. We use the letter d to denote the derivative.The gradient is, on the other hand, a vector which points in the direction of the steepest ascent or the greatest upward slope whose length is the directional derivative in that directionWe use the symbol ∇ to denote the gradient.So why Gradient is a VectorThe regular derivative gives us the rate of change of a single variable. For example, df/dx tells us how much the function f(x) changes for a change in x. But if a function takes multiple variables, such as x and y, it will have multiple derivatives: the value of the function will change when we change x (df/dx) and also when we change y (df/dy).So, now we can represent these multiple rates of change in a vector, with one component for each derivative. Thus, a function that takes 3 variables will have a gradient with 3 components each represented by a partial derivative. And just like the regular derivative, the gradient points in the direction of the greatest increase. However, now that we have multiple directions to consider (x, y, and z), the direction of greatest increase is no longer simply “forward” or “backward” along the x-axis, like it is with functions of a single variable.If we have two variables, then our 2-component gradient can specify any direction on a plane. Likewise, with 3 variables, the gradient can specify and direction in 3D space to move to increase our function.Now it will make sense of the below definition of Gradient. The gradient of vector-valued functionon real domain it is a row vector represented by a row-matrixwhere N is the number of variables.An example, for the following functionthe partial derivatives (i.e., the derivatives of f with respect to x1 and x2 ) areand the gradient is then a matrix with one row (or a row-matrix as it is called)Thank you for reading…References and sources for more reading on this topicTotal Derivative — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_derivativeMatrix Calculus- https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.01528.pdfCalculus — https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-001-calculus-online-textbook-spring-2005/textbook/Calculus — https://oer.galileo.usg.edu/mathematics-ancillary/15/Exercises in Calculus — https://oer.galileo.usg.edu/mathematics-ancillary/15/Analytics VidhyaAnalytics Vidhya is a community of Analytics and Data…Follow1.5K Sign up for Data Science Blogathon: Win Lucrative Prizes!By Analytics VidhyaLaunching the Second Data Science Blogathon – An Unmissable Chance to Write and Win Prizesprizes worth INR 30,000+! Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.

Exploring the Math in a Night Jasmine Plant…,https://medium.com/@negarg0028/exploring-the-math-in-a-night-jasmine-plant-427ef5e21e51?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,"Mathematics,Mathematics Education,Mathematics Teacher,Nature,Mathinnature","They say that Nature is the best teacher; it is the silent teacher that teaches us the most complex of things in the simplest of manner, with the only condition of being listened to. However, we have become so busy in the hustle and bustle of our lives that we have drawn ourselves apart from the nature and the consequences are quite evident in front of us.From quite a few days, I have been intrigued to explore the aesthetic side of Mathematics and for the same, I have been trying to observe the little details in the plants and flowers around me. And fortunately to add to my study, we recently got some new plants at our place which added to a great advantage.The plant in the picture is that of the Night Jasmine plant (Haar Singar / Parijat). And when I talk of Math in the plant, it does not always have to be something complex; it could have been as basic as counting. And having said that, I am, henceforth, sharing my observations:Perpendicular lines: This is the first thing that had caught my attention when the leaves started budding. Each pair of the leaves of the plant intersects the other at almost 90°, allowing for maximum sunlight. (Scientific reason added by a doctor friend.)Linear Pair: The leaves of a pair are inclined at an angle of 180° to each other, thus forming a straight line.Comparisons: There are so many instances in our daily lives where we need to compare things and we don’t always have the required instruments. And these are the instances where we need to have good observational skills. Exposing the children at an early age to such brainstorming questions can help in developing great observational skills. For eg: The gap between the upper two pairs of leaves is greater than the gap between the bottom two.Symmetry: Symmetry is the first thing that comes to our mind when we turn to nature. Why? Because in everyday language, symmetry refers to a sense of harmony and balance. And nature is an epitome of the same. However, in Math, symmetry has a more precise definition:An object is symmetric if it can be divided into two or more identical pieces that are arranged in an organized manner. This means that an object is symmetric if there is a transformation that moves individual pieces of the object, but doesn’t change the overall shape. The type of symmetry is determined by the way the pieces are organized, or by the type of transformation. (Source: Wikipedia)And I could observe three types of symmetries in the plant:Reflectional Symmetry: If we pass a vertical/horizontal line (depending upon which pair you choose) through the centre of a pair of leaves, we will see that the halves are the mirror images of each other. This is called reflectional symmetry.Rotational Symmetry: If one of the leaves of a pair is rotated at an angle of 180° about the leaf node, we get the complete pair. This is called rotational symmetry. And if the half of a leaf is rotated about the node at an angle of 360°, we get a complete leaf.Scale symmetry: Though the size of the leaves is varying at places, but the shape always remains the same. This is called scale symmetry.An object has scale symmetry if it does not change its shape when it is expanded or contracted. (Source: Wikipedia)The number 2: All the leaves of the plant occur in pairs. Is there anything special about 2? Well, yes, 2 is one of the numbers of the Fibonacci sequence and nature has a great affinity for this sequence and has given it a special place in its beautiful forms.These were a few of the observations that I could notice in the plant and I am sure that there might be more.

Recursive Versus Non-Recursive Formulas and the Fibonacci Numbers,https://medium.com/swlh/recursive-versus-non-recursive-formulas-30be9a7c7613?source=tag_archive---------2-----------------------,"Mathematics,Number Theory,Problem Solving,Education,Fibonacci","I’ve decided to try something new today. I’m going to try breaking down a concept covered in the course I am teaching at the University of Tennessee this semester. The course is entitled “Mathematical Reasoning!”The article can not only serve as a reference for my students, but also give anyone else a glimpse into what type of material the course covers. I’m going to only assume a basic familiarity with what sequences are, and the ability to simplify algebraic expressions. I’ll cover some definitions and work through a few examples, using the Fibonacci Numbers as a center point of the discussion.Photograph courtesy of Maklay62 via Pixabay (this is called a Fibonacci spiral)What is a non-recursive formula?A non-recursive formula is a formula for a sequence that does not itself depend on any other terms in the sequence. In other words, the only variable you will need to plug in is the index of the sequence. For instance,S_n = n²is one of the most basic non-recursive formulas. S_n represents the nth number in the sequence, and its formula is n², which can be directly computed by plugging in the value of n you want. Another example of a non-recursive formula:R_n = n⁴ + 3n — 1What is a recursive formula?A recursive formula is a formula for a sequence that depends on one or more of the earlier terms in the sequence. If S_n represents the nth number of your sequence, the formula may have an S connected to a smaller subscript. For instance, a basic recursive formula isS_n = S_{n — 1} + 1It reads as follows: to get the next number in the sequences, add 1 to the previous number. The issue is that you need a starting point, or an initial value. If you try to find S_4 but don’t know S_3, you’ll need to find S_2 in order to find S_3. If you don’t know S_2, you’ll need to find S_1 in order to find S_2, and so on. This madness needs to stop eventually, lest you wind up with something called infinite recursion (which gives many computer scientists a headache when they accidentally implement infinite recursion into a computer program!).So, you have to have a starting point. When working with a recursive formula, you have to be given some values to start out with. In the recursive formulaS_n = S_{n — 1} + 1we could give you S_1 = 4, and then you’d be able to calculate S_2, S_3, and so on, one at a time. We’ll talk about this a bit more in the later sections. However, if you have an S_{n — 1} and an S_{n — 2} in your recursive formula, we’ll actually need to give you TWO initial values. Why might that be?Let’s explore this issue with the recursion given by the Fibonacci numbers,F_n = F_{n — 1} + F_{n — 2}and let’s say I ask you to calculate F_3. I will give you F_1 = 1 as an initial value. No problem, right? Let n = 3 above and we getF_3 = F_{3–1} + F_{3–2} = F_2 + F_1We know that F_1 = 1, soF_3 = F_2 + 1However, what do we do about n = 2? We can’t break it up further with the recursive formula likeF_2 = F_1 + F_0because F_0 isn’t even defined! Our sequence starts at F_1. This means we’ll need to give two initial values. For the Fibonacci numbers, those values will be F_1 = 1 and F_2 = 1 (NOTE: some people prefer to let the initial values be F_1 = 1 and F_2 = 2, but I will let the sequence start with two 1s to be consistent with the way that I taught this lesson in class).I’ll talk more about the Fibonacci numbers in some of the later sections.Can a sequence have both a recursive formula and a non-recursive formula?The short answer to this question is yes. In many cases, given a recursive formula and a starting value, we can “guess” a non-recursive formula (and can even formally verify that our guess works with a procedure called induction; I won’t go into detail about induction in this article). Here’s a simple example where we might be able to guess. Let’s say that our sequence has starting value S_1 = 1 and recursive formulaS_n = S_{n — 1} + 4What are the values in this sequence? Let’s compute a couple using this pattern. We know S_1 so we start with S_2:S_2 = S_{2–1} + 4 = S_1 + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5S_3 = S_{3–1} + 4 = S_2 + 4 = 5 + 4 = 9S_4 = S_{4–1} + 4 = S_3 + 4 = 9 + 4 = 13S_5 = S_{5–1} + 4 = S_4 + 4 = 13 + 4 = 17You could keep going but I think this’ll be enough to get the jist of the pattern. Each number we generated is three less than a multiple of 4. The [positive] multiples of 4 are 4, 8, 12, 16, and so on. The multiples of 4 have the formula R_n = 4n for n = 1, 2, 3, and so on. Plug in the different values of n to check this. Then we can subtract 3 from any of these to get the numbers in the original sequence. Therefore our non-recursive formula isS_n = 4n — 3and this is true for any n that is a natural number. If we want to calculate a number far along in the sequence (a.k.a. when n is big, like 200), it is much faster to use the non-recursive formula. That’s because to use the recursive formula, you’d have to calculate all of the numbers in the sequence before the 200th one, one at a time. I’ll leave that to you if you want to use up the lead in some extra pencils. In the meantime I’ll compute S_{200} in one line:S_{200} = 4(200) — 3 = 800–3 = 797Does a recursive formula satisfy a non-recursive formula?The answer to this question will let us further explore the relationship between recursive formulas and non-recursive formulas. Here’s how it works: we start with a recursive formula and a non-recursive formula. We plug the non-recursive formula into the recursive formula, and simplify the resulting statement algebraically. After the dust settles, we can see if the equation is true for all n. If so, then we say the recursive formula satisfies the non-recursive formula. Let’s consider some examples.Example 1: Does the recursive formula S_{n + 1} = 6S_n — 3 satisfy the non-recursive formula S_n = 6n + 1?Solution: Well, here’s how we proceed: to plug the non-recursive formula into the recursive formula, we can replace S_n with its non-recursive formula:S_{n + 1} = 6S_n — 3S_{n + 1} = 6(6n + 1) — 3 = 36n + 6–3 = 36n + 3Now we have to figure out if this is true? The key is that the non-recursive formulaS_n = 6n + 1is true no matter what natural number we plug in. Thus we can replace n with n + 1 in here:S_{n + 1} = 6(n + 1) + 1 = 6n + 6 + 1 = 6n + 7We have two different expressions for S_{n + 1}. Line them up next to each other:6n + 7 = 36n + 3Is this true for any natural number n? Of course not! Just plug in n = 1 for instance. If this were to be true, the left and right-hand sides would necessarily have the same exact algebraic expression. As a result, we say the recursive formula does NOT satisfy the non-recursive formula.Example 2: Does the recursive formula S_{n + 1} = 5S_n satisfy the non-recursive formula S_n = 4 * 5^n?Solution: we can use the same procedure as the previous problem. Take the formula for the non-recursive formula and substitute it directly into the recursive formula:S_{n + 1} = 5S_n = 5(4 * 5^n) = 4 * 5^{n + 1}In addition, the non-recursive formulaS_n = 4 * 5^nis true for any natural number, so we can replace n with n + 1 and getS_{n + 1} = 4 * 5^{n + 1}The two formulas match! That means the recursive formula does satisfy the non-recursive formula.One last comment about these examples: notice we did NOT need an initial value in order to do anything in these problems.What if the initial terms are different? (Fibonacci vs Tribonacci)Different sequences can have the same recursive formula if they have different initial values. Two of the most famous sequences that are related in this way are the aforementioned Fibonacci numbers, and the Lucas numbers. Remember that the Fibonacci numbers have initial values F_1 = 1 and F_2 = 1, and recursive formulaF_n = F_{n — 1} + F_{n — 2}The Lucas numbers have the initial values L_1 = 1 and L_2 = 3. The recursive formula is the same:L_n = L_{n — 1} + L_{n — 2}Of course, we replace the Fs with Ls to prevent confusion between the two sequences. The point is that even with the same recursive formula, the sequences can be wildly different with different initial values. Here is a list of the first several Fibonacci numbers:1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89On the other hand, here’s a list of the first several Lucas numbers:1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, 123We can see that the Lucas numbers grow a lot faster because the second value in the sequence was bigger. You can think of this as an analogue to compound interest: a little bit extra goes a really long way after a lot of time passes.Special topic: Zeckendorf decompositionsThis last section is not a standard topic in the course I am teaching, but I squeezed in a little bit of discussion on it anyway. Not only is it an interesting application of the concepts of sequences, recursion, and Fibonacci numbers, but it’s also a foundational definition in a series of research projects I conducted with collaborators at Carnegie Mellon, Yale, and Williams.A Zeckendorf decomposition is a way to write a natural number as a sum of Fibonacci numbers, that follows two rules:You must not use F_1You cannot use two adjacent Fibonacci numbers (so if you use F_5, you can’t use F_4 or F_6)There is a famous result called Zeckendorf’s Theorem (proven by the namesake mathematician) that states the following: every natural number has a unique Zeckendorf decomposition. It turns out the reason we require condition 1 above is to ensure the decomposition is unique (otherwise any decomposition that used a 1 and not a 2 could start with either F_1 or F_2).How do we find Zeckendorf decompositions? We can actually use something called a greedy algorithm. A greedy algorithm refers to a process to solve a problem where we take the “largest” or “smallest” choice possible without breaking some given threshold, and then repeat this process amongst the remaining choices as many times as possible. For this problem, the greedy algorithm means the following: pick the largest Fibonacci number that is smaller than our target number, and add it to our decomposition. Continue doing this until we get to zero (at which point nothing else can be added to the decomposition).Here’s an example. Let’s find a Zeckendorf decomposition of 79. I’m going to write out our list of the first several Fibonacci numbers again:1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, …The largest number in this list that’s smaller than 79 is 55, so we put 55 in our decomposition:55 + ???Now, we can’t use any numbers bigger than 55 (the sum would go above 79), and we can’t use 34 since it’s next to 55. Also, for any Zeckendorf Decomposition, we can’t use the first 1, so our possibilities for the next number are1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21What’s the largest number in this list that we can add to 55 without going over 79? It’ll be 21. So now our decomposition looks like55 + 21 + ???We can’t use 13 since it’s next to 21, so our options to continue are1, 2, 3, 5, 8But if we add a 3, we get exactly 79! So we add the 3 on and then we’re done. Our final Zeckendorf decomposition is79 = 55 + 21 + 3 = F_{10} + F_8 + F_4.The StartupMedium's largest active publication, followed by +723K people.

A Complete Introduction To Time Series Analysis (with R):: ,https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/a-complete-introduction-to-time-series-analysis-with-r-estimation-of-mu-mean-cc262c3af459?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,"Statistics,Machine Learning,Time Series Analysis,Mathematics,Forecasting","Sample meanOf course, of the first questions, we always ask in statistics is: “what is the trend/mean?” or “How does this behave on average”? In this article, we consider the problem of estimating the trend, along with its statistical properties. “Why bother?” — you may ask. By knowing its basic statistical properties such as biasness and consistency, we have a more theoretically based ground and quantitative measures to trust or not to trust our estimates. Indeed, if we cannot even be sure of how close to accurate our estimates are, why even bother using them?Sample mean: Expectation and VarianceOf course, we will consider the classical sample mean, that is:How about its mean and variance? As you may expect (pun intended) from your Statistics classes (otherwise check this article), this is an unbiased estimator, that isHow about its variance? This one is given by the intuitive formulaProofSay what!!! That is it. If proofs scare you, feel free to skip the following part, otherwise, let’s get to it. For the expectation is quite easy, asAs we have that expectation is a linear operator. For the variance, we have that, whereThe first line is just the definition.The second line is still the definition.From the second to the third line, note that when expanding the terms, everything cancels ups except the product of the summations.In the fourth line, we pull out the constant, put the expectation operator inside and aggregate summations and terms.The fifth line follows as the expectation of the product of two terms in a time series is in face the autocovariance function.Since |i-j|≤n, we can group the summation terms substituting the variables as h, which produces the additional factor in front of the ACVF.Finally, we can pull the n outside to obtain the form in the final line.Knowing these is useful because it will allows to know how accurate (or off) is the sample mean as an estimator of the trend.Asymptotic propertiesAbove, the main statement is trivial.i. follows by convergence in probability. Don’t worry about it if you don’t know the exact definition. What it means is that as we get more data, if our ACVF becomes smaller, then the MSE also goes to 0.ii. says that if our ACVF forms a non-divergent series, then as we take n times the limit to the variance as n goes to infinity, this is equal as the infinite sum of the covariances. Don’t think too much about this one, this is simply saying that if the ACVF of our series is somehow stable, then the variance of the sample mean estimator will also not explode as we get more and more data.iii. If we assume normality of the data, we can then also infer normality of the sample mean estimator, using the formula for the variance we found before. Note that here we use an infinite sum instead of a finite one, since it becomes more accurate as n goes to infinity!iv. Since we know the previous facts, we can then construct a 100% confidence interval for the value of the mean; about which you should be familiar if you have taken some statistics course before. Otherwise, you can check my statistics review here, in which I have a collection of definitions, theorems, and more!A useful approximationAs we don’t have infinite data, it turns out that the following is often an useful approximation:whereHowever, if you do know the true form of the ACVF beforehand (for instance for an AR or MA process), you should use that one instead with the formula including the infinite summations!How to RMathematical formulas like these are usually not that hard to code, and although usually there are packages that implement these for you, it doesn’t hurt to implement these on our own. The following code illustrates how to do this in R.Estimating the AR(1) meanWe can consider an AR(1) process with a shifted mean, that isThen, we can use what we have learned so far as follows:First, we use the definition. Then, in the second line we plug the ACVF of the AR(1) process, which we found way back in this article; then we factorize the constant terms and expand the summation a bit. In the fourth line, we simply take out one phi term, so that we can apply the summation formula for geometric series. Then we simply apply some algebra, and voilà! We can then construct the following confidence interval:, which tells us that 95% of the time, the true value of our mu will be inside the given range.Next timeNext time we will continue with the estimation and properties of the ACF, one of the main points of time series analysis.

"Le Marketing ne plaira jamais à tout le monde, c’est mathématique.",https://medium.com/@selimbhy/le-marketing-ne-plaira-jamais-%C3%A0-tout-le-monde-cest-math%C3%A9matique-25023779491d?source=tag_archive---------4-----------------------,"Marketing,Marketing Strategies,Mathematics,Business","Si, comme moi, vous vous trouvez être dans la discipline du marketing et, plus généralement, dans une quelconque configuration de travail créatif non-scientifique, vous avez certainement déjà observé ce phénomène étrange dans votre travail : Vos collègues croient qu’ils peuvent vous dire ce qu’ils pensent de ce que vous faites. Ils vous donnent des avis sur votre travail, chose qu’ils ne font pas avec le comptable !Le professionnel du marketing, c’est ce petit être étrange en jeans / baskets, qui déambule dans les couloirs des entreprises et qui passe sa journée à parler de “reach”, de “stratégie de growth” et de “funnel d’acquisition” et dont les collègues se demandent pourquoi il est autant payé.Le professionnel du marketing, c’est ce même type qui doit systématiquement envoyer son travail à des boucles plus ou moins larges pour qu’on lui “valide” son idée, son design, sa stratégie, bref…pour que tout le monde soit du même avis sur ce qu’il fait.Or, concilier les avis de tout le monde est sans doute l’une des plus grandes frustrations du marketeur qui finit par perdre sa créativité, son envie d’innover et sa capacité à délivrer et à émerveiller (après tout, nous sommes payés pour ça).Ce problème est donc d’une importance cruciale et je prends ici, la liberté de tenter d’expliquer pourquoi donner son avis (systématiquement j’entends) sur le marketing est nocif, en plus d’être inefficace.Et, puisque j’ai du respect pour les mathématiques, je vais me reposer sur une des théories admises par la discipline pour tenter de vous expliquer pourquoi.La démocratie est une impossibilité mathématiqueCa a l’air compliqué, mais ça fait stylé.Le théorème d’impossibilité d’Arrow, également appelé « paradoxe d’Arrow » (du nom de l’économiste américain Kenneth Arrow), est une confirmation mathématique, dans certaines conditions précises, du paradoxe soulevé et décrit dès 1785 par Nicolas de Condorcet.Supposons que chaque électeur ne puisse exprimer son opinion que de manière qualitative, en indiquant comment il classe les unes par rapport aux autres les options envisagées.Entre deux options, l’électeur indique celle qu’il préfère ou s’il est indifférent entre les deux, par contre il ne peut pas exprimer l’intensité de sa préférence.Dans ce cadre, il n’existe pas de processus de choix indiscutable, qui permette d’exprimer une hiérarchie des préférences cohérente pour une collectivité à partir de l’agrégation des préférences individuelles exprimées par chacun des membres de cette même collectivité.Ici, nous pourrions arrêter d’expliquer quoi que ce soit tant l’énoncé de ce théorème semble limpide.Nous allons quand même tenter d’illustrer ce théorème par un exemple afin de lever toute ambiguïté.L’exemple des deux logosSupposez que votre marketeur vous envoie 2 propositions de logo et que vous êtes 3 personnes à recevoir ces propositions. Le marketeur vous demande de classer ces 2 propositions (il vous demande en réalité de choisir celle qui vous plaît, ce qui est, implicitement, une forme de classement).Voici ce que reçoit votre marketeur :Personne 1 choisit A (A > B)Personne 2 choisit B (B < A)Personne 3 vous ignore (c’est le mec qui ne répond jamais aux mails, chaque entreprise en possède un).Résultat : ???Face à un tel dilemme, par trop fréquent dans le métier, ce que la plupart d’entre-nous tend à faire, c’est de surpondérer les réponses en fonction de la position hiérarchique des répondants, ce qui donnerait :Personne 1 : A > B mais Personne 1 est mon N+1. Pondération : x 100 000Personne 2 : B < APersonne 3 : Indifférent (lui, si un jour je deviens milliardaire, je le fais danser en slip sur du Rihanna!).Résultat : Choisir A.Vous voyez le problème?Puisqu’il est difficile (et selon Arrow, impossible) de générer un consensus de façon démocratique, nous avons tendance à biaiser les résultats de nos consultations sur des critères subjectifs et peu efficaces.Que doit alors faire le professionnel du marketing?La première option consiste à ignorer cette problématique, considérer que cette lecture est totalement inutile et que je vous ai fait perdre votre temps (auquel cas, je vous prie de m’excuser).La deuxième option consiste à se dire que, puisque le consensus est mathématiquement impossible, le marketeur ferait mieux de n’écouter que son propre jugement sans devoir subir les remarques et opinions des collègues qui, après tout, n’y connaissent rien.La troisième — ou devrais-je dire la bonne — option est de mettre en place un système d’évaluation transparent et froidement objectif en écartant du mieux que vous pouvez, les opinions d’ordre ”esthétique” (je n’aime pas ce rouge!) et les considérations d’ordre “émotionnel” (la photo sur le visuel me paraît triste!).Pour cela, tentez d’isoler dans chaque livrable, les éléments d’évaluation objectifs que vous souhaitez soumettre à validation, par exemple :Les données sont-elles correctes?Y a t’il des fautes d’orthographe ?La quantité d’informations sur le livrable est-elle suffisante?Etc …Ce sont ces éléments objectifs que vous proposerez à vos collègues d’évaluer, rien de plus et rien de moins.Ici, il est important de préciser à vos collègues le cadre général de l’échange et de leur fournir un framework d’évaluation clair et borné (un fichier Excel, des échelles d’évaluation de 1 à 4,…) dès que vous ouvrez votre boucle de validation.J’ai moi-même souvent fait l’erreur d’envoyer mon travail à une liste de personnes en leur demandant simplement “Qu’en pensez-vous?” pour découvrir qu’une majorité ne répondait pas et que la minorité qui répondait se mettait à lister les 1 000 raisons pour lesquelles mon travail était nul.Et je ne devais pas leur en vouloir! C’est moi qui avait ouvert la boîte de Pandore en ne créant pas les conditions optimales du feedback constructif.J’avais juste demandé “Qu’en pensez-vous ?” et les gens ont sincèrement répondu à ma question.Pour conclure, quelques points à retenir :Le Marketing repose sur du concret mais également sur du subjectif: Seul le concret est mesurable.Le consensus est impossible et le marketing ne peut pas plaire à tout le monde : Vous n’êtes pas obligés de plaire à tout le monde.Si vous posez les mauvaises questions, vous aurez les mauvaises réponses : Essayez de créer les conditions optimales du feedback constructif.Voilà, j’espère que cette lecture vous a été utile.N’hésitez pas à réagir et à partager avec moi vos anecdotes et vos conseils.Written bySelim BEN HADJ YAHIAEvery “ism” is extreme.

Lessons From NBA Play-By-Play Data — Part I (Basics),https://medium.com/@cooperchia3/lessons-from-nba-play-by-play-data-part-i-basics-a57df73dda56?source=tag_archive---------5-----------------------,"Basketball,Data Science,Sports,Programming,Mathematics","As an avid fan of the NBA, box scores are, by far, the quickest and easiest way to gain an understanding of the game action that took place. Points, rebounds, assists, and even slightly more advanced stats like +/- can be gleaned from the box score, both from an individual and a team perspective. But what can’t the box score tell us?Let’s start with Points Per Possession (PPP), a foundation of any league-wide, team, or individual analysis. In terms of measuring scoring ability, PPP is a more accurate quantifier than points-per-game or points-per-minute because it accounts for the difference in minutes-played-per-game (on an individual level) and also accounts for the variation in pace-of-play (on both individual/team levels).So how do we calculate PPP? Calculating points is easy, but possessions are more difficult to assess. There is still no official way of determining what constitutes a possession (seriously), so I decided to use a formula I saw used by Nylon Calculus a few years back:Total Possessions = FGAs + FT Pairs and Triplets + TOVs — ORBs*FGA = Field Goal Attempt*FT = Free Throw*TOV = Turnover*ORB = Offensive ReboundThe first 3 terms of the formula increment the number of possessions, while an offensive rebound decrements the counter since it extends a team’s possession. Notice how only FT Pairs and Triplets are counted, as and-1 FTs would overcount a possession since FGAs are already accounted for. Additionally, our ORB counter must be tweaked slightly to avoid counting team-offensive-rebounds that occur on missed FTs and at the end of quarters (more details can be found here).You’ve probably guessed that the formula for possessions contains too many subtleties to be computed using only the box score.Enter NBA Play-By-Play (PBP) Data.Play-by-play data records every single play that occurs in every basketball game. The dataset I used (via Kaggle) contains full play-by-play data for the last 4 seasons (2016–2017 to 2019–2020).To calculate PPP, I wrote the following code to implement the formula above, using Python and Pandas:*Note: All analysis done for this article was league-wide analysis.I got the league-wide points per possession to be as follows:2019–2020: 1.11222018–2019: 1.11102017–2018: 1.09352016–2017: 1.0951For reference, these numbers are slightly higher than PPP calculated on NBA.com or ESPN, both of which use estimates derived from box score (not PBP) stats.After calculating PPP, I was curious as to how this number would vary depending on different types of field goals attempted within a possession. Are 3-pointers really more valuable than 2-pointers? Is the midrange dead? To determine this, I first used the play-by-play data to compute the number of FG attempts and number of FG makes from different distances from the basket (removing end-of-quarter heaves from consideration). After gathering the necessary shot data, I used Matplotlib to visualize the results from each of the previous 4 seasons:First, we have the number of shots attempted from different distances, with 2-pointers in blue and 3-pointers in pink. We can see that, consistently, 2-pointers within 5 feet of the basket and 3-pointers in general are most popular (an interesting side note is the dramatic increase in the number of long 3s attempted, but we’ll leave that analysis for another day).This would seemingly support the theory that the midrange 2-point shot is becoming increasingly less relevant. Is there good reason for this? Let’s take a look at field goal percentages from each of the same class of shots described above:Perhaps these results are surprising to you, as they were to me. We can see that shots taken within 5 feet of the basket consistently yield around 60% accuracy, but from 6 feet to 30 feet, league-wide shooting percentages remain relatively constant (somewhere around 35–40%). When we account for the differences in point value for a 2-point make and 3-point make, we get the following expected values for each type of shot:We can see that, with league-average shooting percentages, most 3-pointers indeed represent a much better value than all 2-pointers outside of 5 feet. Another interesting observation is the slightly better efficiency of 11–15 foot shots than 6–10 foot shots. I would assume there are a number of reasons for this, but, again, I’ll leave this analysis for a different day.Now that we have the expected value of each shot, I wondered, what if offensive rebounding rates varied for different shot distances? As we discussed earlier, an ORB extends a possession, so if more ORBs are grabbed for a certain type of shot, surely that would increase the shot’s value. So I wrote some more code to compute the percentage of misses that result in an ORB for each shot distance, yielding the following results:The general trend seems to be that a miss closer to the basket is more likely to result in an offensive rebound. This seems to raise the value of layups even more, but wait. Let’s recall that the probability of a missed shot inside of 5 feet is much lower than a missed shot outside of 5 feet. Instead, we should be looking at the percentage of shot attempts (not misses) that result in an ORB:Surprised by the results? I was too. We can clearly see that 2-point shot attempts within 6–10 feet have the highest probability of generating an offensive rebound. Now how does this affect the expected values of shots we calculated earlier? To get an idea of this, I added the product of ORB% and PPP to the expected values determined previously, since an ORB extends/resets a possession. Of course, there are some details that get missed by using such a simple calculation. For example, 3-pointers most likely generate more long ORBs, which are probably less likely to generate second-chance points than an ORB grabbed right under the basket. Nonetheless, this updated formula should still be able to estimate how ORBs affect the value of a shot:Nothing too surprising here. We can see that layups and 3-pointers are still the most valuable. However, I noticed that 6–10 foot shots are now slightly more valuable than 11–15 foot shots, contrary to the expected values computed without accounting for ORBs. This makes sense because we saw that 6–10 foot shot attempts are most likely to get offensively rebounded!That’s it for Part I of my Play-By-Play Data Analysis. I hope I was able to demonstrate some of the basic but interesting things that can be uncovered using PBP data. The next steps of my analysis may include classifying shots by both distance AND location, team and individual analysis, and a more thorough investigation of points generated after an ORB. If you would like to check out the code I wrote for this analysis, you can find it here: https://github.com/crchia/nba-pbp-data-analysis.If you have any questions or suggestions, I’d love to hear them in the comments.

Nothing Is Permanent Except Change,https://medium.com/an-idea/nothing-is-permanent-except-change-heraclitus-c9330f2b3cc7?source=tag_archive---------6-----------------------,"Mathematics,Mathematics Education,Wolfram,Education,Education Technology","Computational Thinking About Change Using the Wolfram LanguagePhoto by Simon Berger on UnsplashFall is just around the corner in Central Illinois, and this is my favorite season of the year. Don’t get me wrong, I love the springtime after a cold winter, but the relief from the summer heat and the display of fall foliage is always the best in my opinion.Nature excels at gradual change. Every day, every hour, every leaf on every tree slowly changes color from green to yellow and red. Every usable part of each leaf is sucked out of it and stored in the trunk and roots of the tree for the following year. Finally, the remaining dried remains of the leaf falls down to the ground to turn into soil.Photo by sam on UnsplashIn mathematics, the study of continuous change is known as calculus. Independently invented in the late 17th century by Newton and Leibniz, calculus is now of the core mathematics curriculum of all universities. Few mathematical disciplines have had such a profound impact on solving real-world problems as calculus.But calculus is not easy to understand and building intuition has often meant solving large amounts of calculus problem by hand. Those with the patience and stamina to do so eventually grasped the elegant ideas that underly calculus. Those lacking those skills often “failed” and found other ventures to pursue.Today, things are very different. We have computers and especially software, like Mathematica and Wolfram|Alpha, which take the grunt work out of calculus whilst making it much easier to develop and test your intuition. Key functions like Integrate and D (for derivatives) provide the mechanics of calculus calculations, while a large number of visualization functions, like Plot, ComplexPlot, ParametricPlot, and many others help to build understanding and intuition.(image by author)Even with all those excellent and easy to use functions you still need a narrative to explain the concepts. Just using these functions without context is too confusing. To help with this the educational arm of Wolfram is provides a number of really nice courses. One of these courses is an introductory course into calculus:Introduction to Calculus, Interactive Online Video Course: Wolfram USign In to Start Free Course A comprehensive introduction to fundamental concepts in calculus, including video lessons…www.wolfram.comWritten and narrated by Dr. Devendra Kapadia, this 10-hour course delivers on explaining calculus topics while using Mathematica as a tool to guide explorations and enhance understanding.While mathematical truths are never changing, the way we learn and understand mathematics is changing very rapidly in our generation. The time we free up from tedious manual calculations can be spent on exploring new and intriguing mathematical concepts.Those new concepts can then help us understand the world around us better and more deeply and, perhaps, one day we can truly understand a seemingly simple transformation of a green leaf to a beautiful orange-red leaf!Photo by Chris Lawton on Unsplash“Nothing Is Permanent Except Change” — HeraclitusAn Idea (by Ingenious Piece)Everything Begins With An IdeaFollow12 1 MathematicsMathematics EducationWolframEducationEducation Technology12 claps12 claps1 responseWritten byArnoud BuzingFollowI create awesome software at Wolfram Research, makers of Mathematica, Wolfram|Alpha, Wolfram Cloud, and many other products and services.FollowAn Idea (by Ingenious Piece)FollowNo Matter What People Tell You, Words And Ideas Can Change The World.FollowWritten byArnoud BuzingFollowI create awesome software at Wolfram Research, makers of Mathematica, Wolfram|Alpha, Wolfram Cloud, and many other products and services.An Idea (by Ingenious Piece)FollowNo Matter What People Tell You, Words And Ideas Can Change The World.More From MediumThe Prime Numbers Cross: Hint of a Deeper Pattern?Riccardo Di Sipio in Cantor’s ParadiseExploiting  Regular ExpressionsSomdev SangwanA Finite Solution to Lorentz Factor at the Speed of LightNicolus Rotich in Cantor’s ParadiseAll About Root SystemsBen Nasmith in Cantor’s ParadiseAveraging TimeScott Bastek in Analytics VidhyaPrime FactorisationMike NöthigerMonty Hall’s paradox — solve it by simulation!Alexander OsipenkoRandomness, Chaos Theory, and the Return to the Dark AgesNathan ToddLearn more.Medium is an open platform where 170 million readers come to find insightful and dynamic thinking."
Generate A Palindrome From Any Number,https://medium.com/@eliran9692/how-to-generate-a-palindrome-from-any-number-3da4fa3c1ba4?source=tag_archive---------7-----------------------,"Mathematics,Math,Palindrome,Mathematics Education,Programming","Photo by Nick Hillier on UnsplashA palindrome is a sequence of digits or characters which reads the same backward as forward.Was it a car or a cat I saw?No. It was not a random question — It is a palindrome.In this article, I am gonna focus on numeric palindromes and answer an interesting questionIs it possible to generate a palindrome from any number?Maybe there is. let’s pick a number and see if we can generate a palindrome from it. I picked 45. great now let’s reverse this number’s digits and get 54.Now add 45+54 = 99 — here’s a palindrome, quite easy right?Let’s show another quick example. this time I chose 4.By reversing 4 we still get 4, 4+4 = 8.We don’t stop here, we keep on repeating the same operation until we get a palindrome.8 reversed is still 8, 8+8 = 16.16 reversed is 61, 16+61 = 77 — here’s another palindrome.The examples above might have convinced you that this operation will always result in a palindrome if repeating enough times but sadly\glady (you can choose your own emotion there) this is not the case.How many iterations each number needs to become a palindromeFun fact: About 80% of all numbers under 10,000 resolve into a palindrome in four or fewer steps.Lychrel numbersThere is a set of ‘annoying’ numbers that we haven’t been able to generate palindromes from yet.The fact that we haven’t generated palindromes from these numbers doesn’t mean we can’t. It remains an open problem to this day (hopefully I will have to edit this line in my lifetime).The number 196 is the lowest number in the Lychrel numbers and over the years many people have tried to generate a palindrome from it using computer processing.In 2011 Romain Dolbeau completed a billion iterations to produce a number with 413,930,770 digits, and in February 2015 his calculations reached a number with billion digits and a palindrome has yet to be found.Here’s a short demo of generating palindromes from different numbers including 196 (this is gonna run forever).Still runningAnother cool visualization might include taking the number 196 and across a finite number of iterations graph the length of digits we get while trying to generate a palindrome, here’s how 100000 is lookingThis is not surprising at all. I encourage you to think about why.These graphs were generated by the following codeConclusionWhile learning how we generate a palindrome from almost any number we stumbled upon an interesting open problem in mathematics regarding Lychrel numbers.These numbers are simply a set of numbers that we haven’t succeeded to generate a palindrome from, yet.Written byEliran TurgemanSoftware developer, CS student, math enthusiast, writer(?). reach out to me at https://mailchi.mp/63d46ab69a7c/math-inspirationFollowMathematicsMathPalindromeMathematics EducationProgrammingMore from Eliran TurgemanFollowSoftware developer, CS student, math enthusiast, writer(?). reach out to me at https://mailchi.mp/63d46ab69a7c/math-inspirationMore From MediumLinear Algebra 6 | Full Rank, Projection Matrix, And Orthogonal MatrixAdam Edelweiss in SereneFieldWhy Empty Logic Leads to the Liar ParadoxPaul Austin Murphy in Cantor’s ParadiseLinear Regression to analyze the relationship between points and goal difference in Premier League…Zian ChenThe Clever Little Extended Euclidean AlgorithmBrett Berry in Math HacksCOMMENTS TO “THE TWIN PARADOX SOLVED BY A TERRESTRIAL OBSERVER”Massimiliano Dell’AguzzoHow to Make Math Accessible and RelevantWendy Wiseman Fisher in The StartupHow Much Can I Make As A Writer for Cantor’s Paradise?Cantor’s Paradise Team in Cantor’s ParadiseThe Logic of Risk TakingNassim Nicholas Taleb in INCERTOAboutHelpLegalGet the Medium app"
Navigating The Fog-Ideas On Mathematics Education.,https://medium.com/town-publications/navigating-the-fog-ideas-on-mathematics-education-df13f87dbc03?source=tag_archive---------8-----------------------,"Education,Mathematics,Science,Opinion","The point of this article is to share some of the insights I’ve had catching up on my math and science education as an adult, and bullet points to start a conversation on different ways to get students more engaged with this highly creative discipline. Please feel free to criticize and write about your own thoughts. (There’s also a bonus mini-essay at the bottom).Don’t start with equations. Talk about why a mathematical concept was invented in the first place. People need context, and we like to ask “why”. So get that out of the way early. We should think about teaching the history and origins of every new subject. Most people are at least somewhat interested in this.Long lectures can be boring and exhausting. (Unless you have a firm understanding of everything already, and are already interested). Keep them short, and don’t show more than one concept at a time.When first demonstrating a new equation, it may be better for the teacher not to talk, and just do the problem a few times silently. It’s distracting to use part of your brain for listening, and another part for understanding what’s happening on the board. People are trying to process your words and learn something visual at the same time. I suggest sticking to one or the other until the concepts are more understood.Don’t ask “does that make sense?” when first starting something new, since it probably doesn’t, and it causes severe anxiety (at least for me). Rephrase to something like “anything in this that you want to go over again?” Try to avoid deer-in-headlights situations.Don’t shun calculators or online step-by-step equation solvers for homework. You need to build up confidence, so it’s nice to be able to verify your work and process with real time feedback. Especially when your first getting started. This avoids extending not fully understood concepts to other problems. And you don’t get frustrated early on by just getting some simple arithmetic wrong, or missing a crucial step, and re-doing everything over and over and over again.Within reason and practical time frames, have few limits on test and homework re-do’s. The point is to learn something not punish someone.Possibly ban tests altogether (especially timed tests). It’s not a realistic situation when your working as an adult where the environment is filled with collaboration and quality assurance. This can just promote a simply “passing” mindset, rote memorization and test taking skills more than anything else.To zoom out a little. When we go through the education system and don’t understand the process and history of science, we tend to think of it as a non-creative endeavor. Math, Physics, Chemistry, Engineering, Medicine and Biology, for better and worse, has created our modern world. It is inherently creative. Art is simply creating something from the imagination, there is no core distinction between disciplines, just a different set of tools and the type of lens that it puts on the world. In a strange twist, as with any form of art, we often highly value it’s end products, but not necessarily the process of it’s creation.When we don’t understand scientific methods, we naturally tend to distrust practitioners since their world is obfuscated and unclear. With many understandable reasons, we all can be a little frightened of the end products. Just as we can be frightened with a painting or a piece of music where its message is misunderstood. This can cause a bit of a fracture in society, and an opportunity to some who capitalize on this forever dense fog of confusion of how the world operates. The repercussions influence on all our lives. Not just in education, but to our politics, to economics, to the environment, etc.We only have so many options for making decisions in this world. Science is simply a tool like a camera, piano or a pen. Its a mechanism like any other, in this case designed to facilitate good judgement and make this foggy, complicated world a little less frightening and more understandable.Town PublicationsPractical and Not Practical IdeasFollowEducationMathematicsScienceOpinionWritten byPaul CampbellFollowCoder, Designer and Arm-Chair ScientistFollowTown PublicationsFollowIdeas on science, politics, education and art.FollowWritten byPaul CampbellFollowCoder, Designer and Arm-Chair ScientistTown PublicationsFollowIdeas on science, politics, education and art.More From MediumI Homeschooled My Children on PurposeRosennab in The AscentAcademia, Publishing, and Scholarly CommunicationSanghyun Baek in PlutoNo, educators and policymakers shouldn’t just ‘do what the research shows’Frederick M.

"<strong class=""cc"">Why We Need Mathematics to Understand the Brain</strong>",https://medium.com/cantors-paradise/why-we-need-mathematics-to-understand-the-brain-93c9e44b0186?source=tag_archive---------9-----------------------,"Neuroscience,Science Communication,Mathematics,Brain,Mind","When I tell people that I use mathematics and engineering to study and understand how the brain works, the reaction I get is oftentimes one of confusion. Despite the seemingly head scratching connection between the two, the reality is that we will never be able to understand how the brain works as a system without the use of mathematics and related applied fields of physics and engineering. To understand why, we first need to understand something about how complex the brain is.The brain is truly a complex system, in the sense that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.The brain is complex, not merely complicatedThe brain’s incredible capability to learn new things, be creative, and its ability to extrapolate new information from limited and incomplete (noisy) data are the result of an almost uncountable number of internal computations.To attempt to grasp the size of this computational machine, consider that the brain is a massive network of densely interconnected cells consisting of about 171 trillion brain cells — about 86 billion neurons and another 85 billion non-neuronal cells. There are approximately 10 quadrillion connections between neurons alone — that’s 10 followed by 15 zeros.Beyond just the sheer size of this huge network, it is important to appreciate that the brain is truly a complex system, in the sense that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. It has the ability to display hard to grasp emergent properties such as self-awareness and consciousness. Yet even these properties are presumably outcomes of the same brain computations. How it achieves all this remains one of the greatest mysteries in science.If we are to ever understand all the incredible things the brain can do, we will need to rely on mathematics as a unifying language and framework. We just cannot keep track of everything we know about the brain without it.For our purposes here, it is important to differentiate complex from merely complicated. The brain is complex in the sense that the individual parts or components that make it up work together to produce emergent properties that cannot be fully explained or understood by a consideration of the interactions of the individual components themselves, such as cells and molecules, even though we have considerable knowledge about cells and molecules and how they function.In contrast to the brain, consider for example a Space X rocket or NASA space shuttle. Both are clearly very complicated engineering systems, but they are not complex. There is an engineer somewhere that knows the function and role of every bolt and screw, and how that bolt or screw contributes to the operation of the whole system, even if that knowledge is spread across many individuals. However, in a complex system such as the brain this is not the case, and simply knowing everything there is to know about the individual parts does not guarantee an understanding of emergent properties.Another way to think about the complexity of the brain is by considering its ability to display incredible degrees of plasticity, robustness, fault tolerance, and adaptability. One extreme example of the human brain’s incredible robustness and ability to adapt is a neurological condition called Rasmussen’s encephalitis, a rare pediatric chronic inflammatory neurological disorder that typically affects one hemisphere. It is characterized by severe and frequent seizures that if left untreated result in loss of motor function, loss of speech, cognitive decline, and other neurological deficits. Most patients eventually stop responding to drugs and other medical treatments. In many cases the only effective treatment is a hemispherotomy, whereby portions or the entire affected cortical half of the brain is surgically removed. Or the corpus callosum, the high speed connections between the two halves of the brain, is cut from the unaffected hemisphere. Yet, to varying degrees, the remaining cortex in these patients is able to take up the functions of the lost brain tissue to a remarkable extent. In most cases these patients are able to function cognitively and physically almost normally considering how much of their brains are removed. Now contrast that with what would happen if you removed half the transistors or circuits in your computer.The role of mathematics in understanding the brain is essentialGiven this degree of complexity, if we are to ever understand how all the interactions and computations give rise to the incredible things the human brain (and those of many other specie) can do, we will need to rely on the use of mathematics as a unifying language and framework within which to describe everything. To put it bluntly, we just cannot keep track of all the moving parts, the details of everything we know about the brain, without it.Neurobiological experiments that generate details about how the brain works at all different scales — genetic, molecular, cellular, and in networks — are at the core of our understanding of a myriad of processes that underlie how the brain works. After all, neuroscience, like all the natural sciences, is an experimental endeavor. However, in the face of such complexity it is simply impossible to arrive at a deep understanding of the brain’s computations and its emergent properties and cognitive capabilities by considering individual details and components in isolation, be they genes, ion channels, proteins, neurons, or entire brain regions. We need the power of mathematics to keep track of all the details and their constantly changing interactions in order to understand how they influence one another. There are simply too many moving parts, too many details. Such mathematical models of the brain are also necessary to allow logical inferences to be drawn that inform our conceptual understanding. How a set of computations A result in an observed outcome E, such as a behavior or other motor output, needs to be logically connected through B, C, and D to infer a causal relationship that gets you from A to E. If the number of dynamically changing details is too great, purely descriptive models that attempt to connect those details ‘in words’ are just not capable enough. We need a mathematical model to keep track of everything.Of course, as I already stressed, the data and understanding gained by experiments about individual details is critical for informing such mathematical models. The predictive and descriptive power of mathematics when applied to any physical system, including the brain, can only be as good as the experimental data that goes into it in the first place.It is also important to appreciate that in the course of pursuing a mathematical and systems engineering understanding of the brain, it does not necessarily mean that we have to reverse engineer it in every detail to the point that we are modeling every aspect of how the biology itself implements the brain’s internal algorithms. The substrate, the ‘wetware’, that the brain is made from necessarily constrains how biology is able to execute those algorithms. But the rules and algorithms responsible for brain computations are independent of the wetware. From a mathematical perspective, this means that we can draw a distinction between a level of mathematical detail about what is being modeled in order to capture and describe a brain algorithm, versus the biological details that can be intentionally ignored. In essence, mathematical descriptions abstract away the details of the biological implementation. This opens up the opportunity for a mathematical and engineering understanding of the brain to inform other major engineering fields such as machine learning and artificial intelligence. And conversely, for those fields to inform how we study the brain.Eugene Wigner (1902–1995) in 1960 wrote a well known essay entitled “The unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences”. Physics has always taken advantage of this. Computational neuroscience has a similar history in its attempt to understand the brain, with some home runs (such as Hodgkin and Huxley’s Nobel Prize winning work to understand the action potential) but much more limited success overall. Modern neuroscience however is now at an inflection point in the sense that to make truly groundbreaking progress in our understanding of the brain mathematics will need to increasingly play a central role, not a supporting one. God speaks every language with equal fluidity, but his native tongue is mathematics.Cantor’s ParadiseMedium’s #1 Math Publication!Follow684 5 NeuroscienceScience CommunicationMathematicsBrainMind684 claps684 claps5 responsesWritten byGabriel A.
